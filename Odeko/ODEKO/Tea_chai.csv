Original Oregon Chai is brewed black tea with the addition of vanilla, honey and spices. </p><p><br></p><p>To prepare, you simply take 1 part Oregon Chai and 1 part milk—you can use soy, rice, cow, goat—whatever! Heat on the stove, in the microwave or froth it with your espresso machine’s steam wand. You can also drink it cold—just pour the mixture over ice. Experiment with your chai. You can add flavored syrups to it, chocolate—even espresso!</p><p><br></p><p style=""box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roobert-Regular; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; font-size: 14px;""><strong>32oz Carton</strong></p><p style=""box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roobert-Regular; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; font-size: 14px;"">Serving size: 4-6oz (8 servings per container)</p><p style=""box-sizing: inherit; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Roobert-Regular; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; font-size: 14px;""><br></p>","","0abda748-e8a6-51de-a053-4227ce4e8489","Each","1 quart","","",,,"https://cdn-s3-odeko-item-management-prod.odeko.com/images/5b1d3ced-7879-4818-b204-ecba6b9eb8d7.png",,"https://portal.odeko.com/supply/locations/238ae091-397c-480d-b630-88c1202274b1/catalog/item/c00cb35b-9079-4732-a58f-8d5f4e01aee9",,,,"Oregon Chai","Tea & Chai","Chai",,,"ODEKO",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
