Muscat Rutherglen,"HISTORY: For the past 40 years winemaking responsibility at Chambers has rested with Bill Chambers, Chairman of Judges at the Melbourne Wine Show since 1980 and one of Australia's most respected wine personalities. Bill has recently entrusted son, Stephen, with the care of the ‘old material’ – dark, unctuous fortified wine that has matured quietly in the Chambers’ family cellars for more than a century. 

WINEMAKING: In the warm fall climate the grapes ripen and shrivel on the vines producing natural sugar levels in the range of 30-36 degrees Brix. The raisined grapes are then picked, crushed and partially fermented before fortification. Wood aging follows in a program loosely resembling a solera system, lasting, in some cases, for over 100 years. 

TASTING NOTES: Produced from Muscat a Petit Grains, or Brown Muscat as it is more commonly known, this blend is comprised of material aged between six and ten years old. Amber gold in color with copper hues, the nose offers fresh raisins, sultanas, lifted spirit and cinnamon oak spices. The palate is rich and silky, its sweet dried fruits balanced by aged oak tannins and bright acidity, providing a clean, rather than cloying, finish.

Champagne 1er Cru Extra Brut,"VINEYARDS & WINEMAKING: Champagne Collet’s vineyard sources are in Premier and Grand Cru villages that reflect the diversity of Champagne’s terroirs. The fruit comes from 850 growers spread over 160 different crus (there are a total of 320 crus in Champagne). However, winemaker Sebastien Walasiak uses no more than 10% of the overall vineyard yields. Sebastien blends the base wines of the classic Champagne varieties from hundreds of individual vineyards and several vintages – vital, because blending is the ultimate art of Champagne and is the key to maintaining Champagne Collet’s incomparable house style. The wines are aged far beyond the minimum requirement in the winery’s 100-year-old chalk cellars resulting in softer wines needing less dosage. 

TASTING NOTES: Chardonnay creates elegance and finesse, Pinot Noir adds depth and structure, and Pinot Meunier imparts freshness and rich fruit driven flavors. A poised champagne given that there is minimal sugar-dosage added after disgorgement, it is a true reflection of its original terroirs and grape varietals. The nose is fresh and vibrant and leads to attractive citrus notes and a suggestion of salinity. The palate reveals an elegant minerality, complex fruit flavors and spot on balance. The essential pairing with oysters and caviar.

Anaperenna Barossa Valley,"With the 2004 vintage, Ben Glaetzer took over winemaking at Glaetzer and brought his own flagship wines into the fold. Young Glaetzer has implemented many changes at the winery, particularly with regard to harvesting upon physiological ripeness vs. analysis, longer skin contact and the use of the highest possible quality oak barrels. The Glaetzer philosophy focuses simply on the production of small-volume, super premium wines. The company holds a firm belief that the wines are made in the vineyard  a combination of the French notion of terroir combined with Australian vineyard site knowledge. The wines are produced from vines grown in well-drained sandy clay loam over a solid limestone pan. This particular soil, widely recognized as the best for dry grown Shiraz, is limited to the Ebenezer region in the northwestern part of theBarossaValley. Yields are exceptionally low, with 1 to 1 1/2 tons per acre of Shiraz from some of the 80-year old vines being common. Glaetzer has exceptional fruit, and thus opts for a minimalist approach.ÿÿ The name Anaperenna has been inspired by Anna Perenna, the Roman goddess of the New Year.The grapes were fermented in Fermented in 1 ton open fermenters, hand plunged 3 times daily. Completed primary fermentation on skins and malolactic fermentation in oak. Matured for 16 months in 100% new oak, 92% French. Matured on lees to maintain fruit profile and animation, minimal SO2. Topped up every 3 weeks and and bottled unfilited to insure minimal intervention.The 2009/2010 growing season produced excellent rains which fully recharged the groundwater system that had been parched from almost seven years of drought. A mild spring contributed to an early budburst. Good balanced warmth in November resulted in excellent foliage cover. The summer months were mild to warm. Berry size was relatively small, producing steady flavor development. 2010 is on of the vintage highlights of the last few decades.",,1973304,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/994522/0cb6165d083b1bd5b3e0b.png?1560319120,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/67XAR,,,,Glaetzer,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Davies Family Selections,Australia,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Food Style:
Perfect with all full-flavoured meat dishes, and ideal with traditional French cuisine as well as more international dishes whose flavours include a note of spice.",,1475380,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632162/e1bb17c9eb9dff1f0288d.png?1616725886,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/7ZUKL,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Chardonnay Straight Shooter Willamette Valley,"VINTAGE: A wet, cool spring delayed flowering until late June but hot, dry conditions prevailed throughout the summer. The fruit set was generally higher than average and some grape bunches were thinned to promote flavor intensity. A few days of rain in September refreshed the soils, slowed ripening, and built flavor complexity. Mild, dry weather in early October allowed the grapes to be picked at optimum ripeness and acidity. 

WINEMAKING: The grapes were harvested in the cold of the morning and transported to the winery. Bunches were immediately pressed and the juice was transferred to stainless steel tanks for cold settling. After being racked off solids the juice was allowed to warm naturally and was then inoculated with cold tolerant yeasts. After fermentation, 50% of the wine was matured in seasoned French oak for ten months prior to bottling. 

TASTING NOTES: The inaugural vintage of Straight Shooter Chardonnay has heaps of character. The wine expresses standout primary aromas of yellow fruits and citrus zest followed by meringue, nougat and lemon verbena notes. The palate is fruit-driven and balanced while also light on its feet. The pronounced meyer lemon and bosc pear characters are sustained by a vibrant acidity through the long finish.

Fleurie Gamay Noir Château Vivier Monopole,"Fleurie French for “flowery,” Fleurie is known for an elegant, floral style of Beaujolais. If Moulin-à-Vent is the King of Beaujolais, Fleurie is certainly the Queen, ranking among the most revered Beaujolais Crus. Our Chateau Vivier monopole, one of the oldest monopole plots in the region, is in the heart of Fleurie and produces a lively, expressive wine from its 80-year-old untrained vines. This is a biodynamic vineyard farmed 100% by horse and hand. No machines are allowed in the vineyard, not even for fertilizing, because our grower does not want the vines exposed to exhaust fumes.

Winemaking
The fruit was de-stemmed and the whole berries underwent a long, natural ferment utilizing wild yeasts in open-top vessels. The wine matured over the following 11 months in second use French oak, achieving a subtle integration of oak spice characters.

Toscana Vermentino,"WINEMAKER:  Alberto Antonini REGION:  Tuscany, Italy : Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) VARIETALS:  100% Vermentino MATURATION:  60 days on fine lees in stainless steel ALCOHOL:  12.5% alc/vol   
WINEMAKING: Regarded as one of the pioneers of modern Italian winemaking, Antonini combines a global perspective with a unique vineyard location to craft modern Tuscan wines with a Mediterranean slant, wines that gain elegance and mineral complexity as they age. The fruit was gently pressed as whole bunches under nitrogen gas protection to avoid oxidation and the juice was naturally settled at low temperature. After racking off the gross lees, the juice was fermented in chilled stainless steel tanks for 20 days. No malolactic fermentation took place but the wine was aged on fine lees for 60 days in order to build its texture and mid-palate weight. Bottled under Stelvin for freshness. Certified organic in Italy. 

TASTING NOTES: Elegant bouquet with notes of citrus blossom and tangerine. The palate shows great balance of acidity and texture. This fresh and vibrant wine finishes long, with a nice mineral finish. ABOUT POGGIOTONDO: In the north-western corner of the Chianti region, resting on the hills between the Montalbano and Arno valleys, 123 acres of vines are joined by some 2,000 olive trees on the Poggiotondo estate. Founder and winemaker Alberto Antonini is a scholar of modern winemaking earning degrees from the University of Florence, Bordeaux University, and University of California Davis in addition to his winemaking stints around the globe. The Poggiotondo vineyards enjoy a Mediterranean influence and soils are riddled with remnants of sea life that afford minerality and complexity to these modern DOCG and IGT renditions.

Chianti Classico,"Aromatic with bright red fruit, hints of dried leaves and toast. Supple and dry with round red fruit flavors, refreshing acidity and well integrated tannins. 

Organic Farming. Hand Harvested. Maceration lasts 12-18 days, separated by vineyard block. Fermentation in stainless steel tanks for eight days at 84°F is followed by 20 months aging in wood casks (tonneaux and barrique) again separated by vineyard block. The different vineyard blocks are then blended in cement vats for another four months of aging. 

Villa Calcinaia is situated in the center of Chianti Classico near the town of Greve-in-Chianti. This historic estate has been home to the Counts Capponi since 1524, and is maintained by Sebastiano Capponi. Calcinaia is the heart of the Capponi family and each generation gives new life to the fields, woods, vineyards and cellars.

The Broken Fishplate Sauvignon Blanc Adelaide Hills,"BACKGROUND: The name Broken Fishplate comes from the small block of Sauvignon Blanc planted in a tight ‘V’ of the gully. The vine rows follow the contour of the land, eventually meeting, forming a sharp bend in the row. When tackling this sharp bend during harvest, the fishplates that straddle the vines and posts often break, hence ‘the broken fishplate.’ 

WINEMAKING NOTES: Small batches of grapes are crushed gently, chilled, and then transferred to stainless steel basket presses. Gentle extraction of the juice is critical in these early stages to retain the delicate fruit characters. To add complexity and texture, a small percentage of the wine is partially fermented in aged French oak for two to three weeks. 

TASTING NOTES: An intensely aromatic wine, displaying an attractive mix of tropical and herbal notes on the nose. The palate is also abundantly flavorsome with passionfruit, gooseberry, bell pepper and green bean all playing a role. Vibrant, racy acid is seamlessly integrated adding freshness, finesse and length to this fruit laden wine.

The Originals Shiraz Grenache d'Arry's Original McLaren Vale,"This wine displays a level of finesse and freshness that we don’t always encounter in other vintages of the same wine. In a somewhat surprising contrast to this, the wine also displays a dense and varied array of fruit characters, from bright lifted purple plums and rhubarb through to more spice and herbal notes such as sage and cardamom, into even more complex earthy flavours of beetroot and soot. 
These flavours are perfectly supported by a frame of fine, minerally tannins that add a subtle grip and enticingly long finish.

This wine is named in honour of d’Arenberg principal, Francis d’Arenberg Osborn, who is universally known as d’Arry.
