Transatlantic Modern Aromatic Bitters,"We’re proud to introduce the bitters that we never thought we would make: Bittermens Transatlantic Modern Aromatic Bitters

What’s the flavor profile? Extremely complex, but not in a confusing way. It’s a little sweet, nicely bitter and surprisingly fruity. We’ve merged the great bitters of the world to create an aromatic bitter that is useful in such a wide array of drinks.

- From the most classic Aromatic bitters of Venezuela and Trinidad, we created a base that includes gentian, clove, allspice and cinnamon
- From New Orleans style bitters, we blend in angelica and anise seed
- From the iconic Italian Fernet, we fortify the bitterness in a touch of aloe and chicory
- From the Alpine Amaro tradition, we add in chamomile and dandelion
- From the tradition of German digestives, we incorporate cherry bark and licorice

In total, sixteen botanicals make up this unique aromatic offering.

Unlike the major brands, we are not adding in caramel color or any colorants at all (so it’s a golden color). Nor are we adding in any sugar. The sweetness in ours only comes from the licorice root. It’s certified kosher and GMO free.

We think you’ll love it.",,1599496,12,5.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/182608/bc183589eb50699b6427a.png?1523979328,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/477PC,,,,Bittermens,Spirit,Cocktail Bitters,Non-potable,,johnson brothers,Sazerac North America,United States,Alcohol,Spirit,Cocktail Bitters,Non-potable

Barolo,"Behind the original concept for Barolo, there is the need to orient different shades in a single direction. In fact, the most classic producers have always avoided putting the individual expression of the vineyard ahead of the choral vision, capable of restoring an idea of coherence and integration right from the beginning. It is on the wave of this traditional impetus, then, that we decided to make the two faces of the appellation - the kind one of the region’s western slope and the more austere one typical of the land looking east - coexist in the same glass. The decision to sketch the lineaments of an entire terroir in a single wine gives us a bold liquid, rich and virile, capable of exhibiting its character in youth and challenging its development with the right impulse.",,1583451,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2090654/61f913b45f8add0ada72a.png?1636449709,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/CMGGB,,,,Ceretto,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Sutter Home/Trinchero Family Est,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Beaujolais-Villages Vieilles Vignes,"This is a powerful expression of the Gamay grape, sourced from the finest vineyards across the appellation. Notes of rich red fruit combine with a long, satisfying finish to make this wine an excellent pairing with poultry and cheeses of all types. Mature grapes are harvested by hand, destemmed, and fermented with selected yeast in stainless steel vats to preserve natural aromas and flavors.

Millions of years ago, a north-south rift formed in the earth’s crust giving rise to the highland that today forms the Beaujolais-Villages appellation area. Here, the complex soils made up of granitic, magmatic and metamorphic rock allow the Gamay Noir grape to express its personality brilliantly. Thirty-eight picturesque villages surround the hillside vineyards in the Monts du Beaujolais at 1,200 feet, and give this AOC its name.

Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,"Trebbiano is Italy’s most ubiquitous white varietal—and the staple of the quintessential Italian white, turning out the same performance regardless of where it is grown. Abruzzese producers have taken to blending it with more demonstrative varietals, particularly Chardonnay. As for Montepulciano, it essentially offers the antithesis of its regional counterpart, delivering a profile comprised of generous black fruits, low acidity, and sweet tannins. This ample provision has enabled producers to turn out decent bottlings in fairly significant quantities. In recent years, however, producers have sought to maximize Montepulciano’s rich core of black and purple fruits through aging in barrique and rigorous processes of selection, producing concentrated offerings. This has been reinforced through the designation of additional appellations, namely, the Colline Teramane DOCG and the Controguerra DOC, which serve to differentiate Montepulcianos derived from the north and south, respectively.",,1337985,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/606330/40746613910dd6bd144fa.png?1616718407,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/3ZAOS,,,,Gran Conti,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Champagne Brut Blue Top,"Tasting : This vintage is balanced, pleasant, approachable, so to speak.
Eye : Pale yellow in color, with brillant reflections.
Nose : Fruit, primarily yellow fruits, and particularly peach, predominate at the initial tasting. However, there are also aromas of stewed fruits, with a hint of honey. Not to mention floral notes with white flowers offering a foretaste of the lightness of the wine. These are clearly generous and persistent aromas and promise, a highly aromatic vintage. Its primary aromas are of fruit, not just fresh fruit, but also candied fruits.
Mouth : The promise of the aromas in the nose is more than delivered by a round mouth, a subtle attack and good length. The mouth, like the nose, is dominated by fruit-peaches, cherry plums, and then oranges. Freshness, elegance and delicacy emerge gently throughout the entire tasting.

Chianti Classico (Blue Label),"The color is an intense ruby red with faintly garnet tones. The initial aromatic sensations are sweetish and vanilla-like, typical of wines matured in barriques. The clean, ethereal bouquet then highlights Sangiovese’s spicy notes. On the palate we again find very well-integrated oak which, however, soon gives way to hints of wild berry fruit preserve and to that nuance of spices we perceived on the nose.

Chianti Classico Riserva (Gray Label),"On the Nose it gradually unfurls flowers, fruit, spice and gunflint in an intriguingly absorbing array of earthly wide-ranging aromatics.

Chianti Classico Vigneto Di Campolungo Gran Selezione,"Its color is a deep ruby red with a faint garnet tinge. Its aromas are the extremely distinctive ones of Sangiovese: the fundamental notes are those that characterize a Chianti Classico of breed: iris, spices (pepper) and wild berries. On the palate, the oak, held at bay by the wine’s ample fruit, leaves room for nuances of preserves and of spices, which are in perfect harmony with the bouquet.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes.

Winemaking Notes:

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

The additional contact with the yeast lees after barrel fermentation results in a lovely aroma that the French call ‘Noisette’ after the hazelnut character it resembles.

Barrel-Aged Bitters,"Aged in Sazerac Rye Whiskey barrels for 140 days, these Peychaud's Barrel Aged Bitters add a flavorful, spicy twist to any cocktail!
They’re remarkably different products. Classic Peychaud’s offers complex notes of earth, charred nuts, cloves, watermelon rind, licorice root, and charred vegetables, with a distinct, semisweet rhubarb character — particularly on the nose. In contrast, the new Peychaud’s Whiskey Barrel-Aged Bitters are less complicated and initially, and somewhat counterintuitively, a bit sweeter. They don’t take on the cherry woodiness of the wood but rather some of the vanilla and baking spices of the rye. As the bitters hit the palate, that rhubarb turns much more toward cherry fruit, with notes of gingerbread and Christmas spices on the back end.
Peychaud’s is one of the best-selling bitters in the U.S. market. The exact recipe is a closely guarded secret that only a few know!

"The Blender's Collection Malt Whisky Gift Pack (Glasgow, Hedonism, Orchard House)","Two ingredients, three families of blends, limitless adventure...

In this exclusive gift set, discover three delicious ways in which we combine malt whiskies and grain whiskies. Scotland’s two styles of whisky allow for endless experimentation. Blended malts are long established; blended Scotch emerged in the 19th century, while blended grain started with us in 2000.

ORCHARD HOUSE combines exclusively single malt whiskies, making it a blended malt Scotch whisky, whilst HEDONISM draws only on mature single grain whiskies and is that seldom-seen creature, a blended grain Scotch whisky. Then GLASGOW BLEND completes the picture by bringing together both single grain and single malt whiskies in one bottle as a blended Scotch whisky.
