Champagne Blanc de Blancs,"Eye : Pale, crystalline gold with the typical glints of the Chardonnay varietal.

Nose : The aromas of mature Chardonnay can be recognised initially: white peach, candied citrus with notes of lime, honeysuckle and fresh hazelnut, giving way to subtle hints of tangerine and lemon.

Palate : Freshness and tautness mark this typically Charles generosity: the attack is pure and forthright, not aggressive with a surprising suavity for a Blanc de Blancs and emblematic of the maturation of wines in two thousand-year-old chalk cellars.",,1951445,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2770589/14efd6f69a27dd3cbf9e8.png?1695282296,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/QUDD6,,,,Champagne Charles Heidsieck,Wine,Sparkling,White,,johnson brothers,Folio Wine Company,France,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,White
Champagne Brut Réserve,"Eye : The Brut Réserve boasts a deep golden hue. Delicate, vivacious and long-lasting bubbles are the result of a long, slow maturing process in chalk cellars. 

Nose : Thanks to 40 % of reserve wines, the blend offers a complex, elegant, voluptuous nose with a touch of freshly baked brioche, rich toasted notes and sun-drenched fruits - mango, apricot and mirabelle plum - accented by dried fruits, pistachio and almond. 

Palate : The texture is reminiscent of a crisp layer of nougatine on a velvety cream pastry, filled with plump red plums and ripe cherries. The selection of reserve wines gives the wine lushness. The finish reveals a touch of praline along with vanilla and glazed notes.",,1517992,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2335907/5aa2fbad781111e67482f.png?1655123462,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/IOUUF,,,,Champagne Charles Heidsieck,Wine,Sparkling,White,,johnson brothers,Folio Wine Company,France,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,White
Champagne Rosé Réserve,"Eye : Sophisticated powdery pink robe with luminous glints of wild rose. Delicate, vivacious bubbles are the result of extensive ageing in cellars.

Nose : The proportion of reserve wines, white and red, give this rosé blend a subtle, yet complex nose. The initial fragrances recall home-made strawberry jam fresh from the stove, mixed with the fruitiness of vineyard peach, followed by luscious warm notes of gingerbread laced with a touch of cinnamon. 

Palate : The pronounced powerful mouthfeel offers a burst of strawberry, raspberry and blackberry nestled in velvety whipped cream.",,1897991,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2335972/4129e17d89c8f268f1b4d.png?1655123552,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/KK40K,,,,Champagne Charles Heidsieck,Wine,Sparkling,Rosé,,johnson brothers,Folio Wine Company,France,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,Rosé

Champagne Brut Grand Rosé,"The Grand Brut Rosé is a soft hue of salmon pink with a few ruby-cherry reflections. The nose is clearly marked by strawberries. Well-structured with a constant tension between freshness and fruity roundness, the wine is dominated by a red pulpy fruit — perhaps wild strawberry (cream or as a coulis) — giving a soft, coated sensation. It is round with a beautifully fresh finish.

“This is almost a vintage. Indeed, I added just a very little amount of reserve wines. The low dosage gives a nice balance.

Suggested Serving Temperatures: Between 8 C and 10 C (46 F and 50 F)

Champagne Extra Dry Petite Douceur Rosé,"With a beautiful effervescence — a string of fine bubbles — this champagne is very balanced. The mouth is dominated not only by strawberry and raspberry, but also grapefruit and lemon.

“I wanted to play on the subtle balance between sweetness and acidity. I was looking for a wine to pair with desserts typical of my childhood: crepes Suzette, orange blossom cake, a pear tart with cinnamon…” Jean-Pierre Mareigner, Cellarmaster

Suggested Serving Temperatures: Between 8 C and 10 C (46 F and 50 F)

Châteauneuf-du-Pape Rouge,"Guigal produces an intensely concentrated, inviting and complex Châteauneuf-du-Pape that is almost unique to the region today. Their passion for Châteauneuf, the leading appellation of the Southern Rhône, runs as deeply as that for their home sites in the Northern Rhône. The combination of working with top fruit that has perfect ripeness, along with their extraordinary patience in the cellar, results in rich and full, yet savory, spicy, seamless and balanced wines. Wines to enjoy immediately but capable of aging, and, above all, wines that leave you wanting more. Deep, dark red with spice and mature red fruit on the nose.  A rich unctuous wine with powerful complexity and round tannins, offering notes of mature plums, hazelnuts and red fruits.",,1831812,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/475874/d0fc647dce1e928ac2e45.png?1616724772,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/UNE3B,,,,E.

Crozes-Hermitage Rouge,"Crozes-Hermitage can be considered the gateway to the red and white wines of the Northern Rhône Valley. It’s important to note that most of Crozes-Hermitage is produced from the plains to the south and east of Hermitage, and these wines tend to be straightforward. Guigal’s approach is to make a more serious Crozes that also has vigor, intensity and depth.

Côtes du Rhône Rouge,"The Guigal Côtes du Rhône Rouge offers tremendous warmth, spice and pleasure, but in a decidedly individual fashion. It is, unlike virtually every other Côtes du Rhône, based on Syrah, a Northern Rhône approach that lends greater aromatic intensity and structure, though is far more difficult and costly to produce in the Southern Rhône. The aging also goes far other wine in the appellation in its category, a minimum of two years in a combination of stainless steel and foudres, with a deliberate blending over the course of that time that results in a wine of remarkable harmony and complexity.

Gigondas,"We consider Guigal’s Gigondas the “quiet storm” among their village wines. While they have been widely known for their Châteauneuf-du Pape also produced in the Southern Rhône, and they are increasingly important in Crozes-Hermitage in the North, the Gigondas is the wine that when poured jumps up and down and demands attention. It’s a wine of sheer pleasure, full of ripe fruit, and with a depth and even slightly brooding sense that comes from the important Mourvèdre component. Yet is has refinement, complexity, length, and has a terrific ability to age.

Blanc de Noirs Méthode Champenoise,"In California champagne styles, the term “Blanc de Noirs” means a white cuvée (blend) from black grapes. In reality, the color is a very light blush of pink and copper. We achieve this style by gently pressing whole, uncrushed clusters of red grapes with very light pressure. As the grapes are pressed, the skins split and let the juice flow out of the berry. The juice is a light green color at first, then starts to pick up some pink and copper hues as the pressing continues. When the color starts to become too dark, the pressing is stopped to maintain the delicate style we desire.",,1381485,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2555809/4337124f2ad94a2efbafd.png?1677149370,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/C50LL,,,,Korbel California Champagne,Wine,Sparkling,White,,johnson brothers,Brown-Forman,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,White

Brut Rosé Méthode Champenoise,"We use Pinot Noir, Sangiovese and Gamay lots that have a noticeable pink hue and generous strawberry and black-cherry-like flavors for our Brut Rosé. The goal is to consistently produce a rosé that is flavorful, bright and aromatic. One interesting aspect of making a rosé using the classic méthode champenoise process is the color balance. The yeast used in the bottle fermentation process removes some of the color from the California champagne, and the amount of color loss is unpredictable. To correct for this, we use a small amount of young red wine in the sweetening dosage to add a note of complexity and adjust the color back to a nice pink hue.",,1633528,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/1141476/46e61fcbfcb4d548b16b4.png?1616728783,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/G9L9L,,,,Korbel California Champagne,Wine,Sparkling,Rosé,,johnson brothers,Brown-Forman,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,Rosé

Chianti Classico (Blue Label),"The color is an intense ruby red with faintly garnet tones. The initial aromatic sensations are sweetish and vanilla-like, typical of wines matured in barriques. The clean, ethereal bouquet then highlights Sangiovese’s spicy notes.

Chianti Classico Riserva (Gray Label),"On the Nose it gradually unfurls flowers, fruit, spice and gunflint in an intriguingly absorbing array of earthly wide-ranging aromatics.

Chianti Classico Vigneto Di Campolungo Gran Selezione,"Its color is a deep ruby red with a faint garnet tinge. Its aromas are the extremely distinctive ones of Sangiovese: the fundamental notes are those that characterize a Chianti Classico of breed: iris, spices (pepper) and wild berries. On the palate, the oak, held at bay by the wine’s ample fruit, leaves room for nuances of preserves and of spices, which are in perfect harmony with the bouquet.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes.

Winemaking Notes:

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon.

The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Voyage 8 Red Wine,"A vibrant cherry red, this wine opens with a warm, alluring nose.

The palate is silky and smooth, with lush plums and grippy tannins that touch the side of the tongue. An earthy character of leather and cooking over an open fire carries through to the long finish, whose fruit tapers off and yields to toasted wood",,1017340,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/1450425/8a7767d4e4bf6f5f31903.png?1579182861,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6FYU2,,,,Red Schooner,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Wagner,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Cabernet Sauvignon,"""Lush aromas of dried cherries and vanilla bean set the stage for blueberry notes, ripe plum and black tea flavors leading to a velvety mouthfeel and finish."" — John Allbaugh, Winemaker

Vineyards. These Cabernet Sauvignon grapes come from our vineyards in California's Northern Interior which are known for their great fruit. These vineyards have well drained soils and plenty of heat to ripen the grapes beautifully. The long ""hang time"" creates the luscious richness balanced with the smooth finsh.

Fermentation & Aging. Individual lots of fruit were harvested separately according to ripeness and balance of acidity. The grapes underwent de-stemming and a very gentle crushing to ensure a large proportion of whole berries in the must contributing to the explosive fruit character of the wine. Fermentation was carried out in stainless steel tanks with select cultured yeasts. The wine was pumped-over twice daily and the temperature was controlled to an optimum 85°F to extract rich color and flavor. The wines were pressed off their skins and racked twice before being put on American oak to add delicious flavors of vanilla and spice.",,1492543,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/560301/69e1e03260139555ee766.png?1543579909,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/MWVVY,,,,Red Truck Wines,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Bronco Wine Company,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
