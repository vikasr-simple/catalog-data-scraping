Champagne 1er Cru Brut Blanc de Blancs,"VINEYARDS & WINEMAKING: Champagne Collet’s vineyard sources are in Premier and Grand Cru villages that reflect the diversity of Champagne’s terroirs. The fruit comes from 850 growers spread over 160 different crus (there are a total of 320 crus in Champagne). However, winemaker Sebastien Walasiak uses no more than 10% of the overall vineyard yields. Sebastien blends the base wines of the classic Champagne varieties from hundreds of individual vineyards and several vintages – vital, because blending is the ultimate art of Champagne and is the key to maintaining Champagne Collet’s incomparable house style. The wines are aged far beyond the minimum requirement in the winery’s 100-year-old chalk cellars resulting in softer wines needing less dosage. 

TASTING NOTES: This generous and supple champagne is made of 100% Chardonnay from six crus, the majority of which are in the renowned Côte des Blancs region. Aged for a minimum of five years. A subtle bouquet of grapefruit and white flower notes. The palate is delicate and gradual demonstrating a nearly perfect aromatic balance on the long finish.

A poised champagne given that there is minimal sugar-dosage added after disgorgement, it is a true reflection of its original terroirs and grape varietals. The nose is fresh and vibrant and leads to attractive citrus notes and a suggestion of salinity. The palate reveals an elegant minerality, complex fruit flavors and spot on balance.

Ameri Single Vineyard Tupungato,"Named for Domaine Bousquet co-owner Labid al Ameri, Ameri is not just “single vineyard” but “specific cluster,” and made only in exceptional years.

Fermentation with selected yeast at a maximum temperature between 25°C and 28°C for 14 days and 20 days of maceration. 100% Malolactic. Aged in French oak for 12 months.

Wine Details
Made in the appassimento style (similar to Amarone), the three different grapes are left to dry for a month in wooden crates in a dry, well-ventilated environment. There, the grapes lose 30% of their water content, increasing the sugar concentration. Separate stainless-steel fermentation is followed by three months of oak maturation before blending. The final blend undergoes malolactic fermentation to harmonize and soften the wine.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Food Style:

Pinot Noir Rosé Dundee Hills,"WINE OVERVIEW
Pinot Noir Rosé has been a cornerstone of our
production for more than a decade. Comprised of
various clones of Pinot Noir, we intentionally craft our
Rosé to be balanced and bright.
Whole cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel,
our 2019 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir Rosé shows
alluring aromatics of ruby red grapefruit and stone
fruits. The palate displays flavors of watermelon and
strawberry lemonade with mouthwatering acidity. The
lingering notes of minerality on the finish will draw you
back for another sip.
HARVEST OVERVIEW
The 2019 vintage was a return to a classic Oregon
growing season. Bud break, bloom, lag phase, and
harvest dates all fell within days of the 2013 and 2014
vintages. Our estate crop set on target with expected
levels for all varieties. Moderate summer weather
persisted, presenting very few heat spikes and delivering
only one notable record-breaking day in June. Cool, wet
weather arrived early in September, pushing ripening
and delaying the harvest window. The conditions in
late September and October returned to sunny days
and brisk nights, allowing us to pick based on ripe fruit
flavors and near-perfect natural acidity.

Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Jorio,"Jorio was created in the mid-nineties to express the great potential of this varietal, in collaboration with fanatically dedicated Abruzzese winegrowers with vineyards in particularly favourable areas for its growth. The name of the wine is intended as a tribute to the great twentieth-century Abruzzese poet Gabriele D'Annunzio, who made his wild, provincial native soil into a “barbaric” novelty, exciting and transgressive, with which he stirred and won the public’s favour. Here is D’Annunzio’s dedication to his pastoral tragedy The daughter of Jorio: “To the land of Abruzzi, to my mother, to my sisters, to my brother in exile, to my buried father, to all my dead, to all my people between the mountains and the sea, this song of ancient blood I consecrate.” 
Vinification
The grapes are destalked and lightly pressed, then undergo maceration for 10- 12 days in steel fermentation vats. The temperature in this period is kept at between 26o and 28°C. As soon as the alcoholic fermentation is finished, the wine starts the malolactic fermentation. The wine next moves on to the ageing process. About 50% is aged in 5000/8000 litre oak barrels, and the rest in barriques on their third or fourth time of use, for a period of about 12 months. After assemblage, the wine rests in bottle for several months.",,1981274,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/577718/22873ea59d05309675648.png?1616725518,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/SH8TT,,,,Umani Ronchi,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Vineyard Brands,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Terre di Chieti Pecorino Vellodoro,"The name of Pecorino grape variety, also known as “grape of the sheep”, derives from the strong connection between sheep farming and agriculture, and the presence of this grape variety in the areas of shepherds’ transhumance. In the past this grape variety, thanks to its high aromas concentration, its good alcohol content, and even more thanks to its wonderful acidity which is the most distinctive characteristic of Pecorino, was used to improve the quality of wines produced with other varieties. Pecorino growing had almost disappeared because of its very low productivity, and varieties which were quality wise of a lower level, but which had a higher productivity, had been preferred to Pecorino.
