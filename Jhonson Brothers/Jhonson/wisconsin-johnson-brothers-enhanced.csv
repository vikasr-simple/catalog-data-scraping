Colour : Summer barley

Nose : Barley sugar and a hint of mint open before moving into freshly cut wild flowers; buttercup, daisy, meadowsweet, myrtle, primrose and cherry blossom. Delicate zephyrs of spindrift and sea pinks are a reminder that this spirit is matured exclusively beside the sea. Over time, and with the addition of a little water, caramelised fruit notes come to the fore, with hints of lemon drops, honey, tangerine and tablet.

Palate: Refined and refreshing, sweet oak and barley notes come together in perfect harmony. Ripe green fruits, brown sugar and sweet malt follow, showcasing the remarkable flavour of the Scottish barley used in this single malt.

Finish : Smooth and well rounded, the finish showcases the elegant balance between the sprightly, vibrant fruit and the subtle sea-spray notes.",,1753383,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/3193824/de0d6a5733a20f84edafb.png?1719476485,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/WZRI8,,,,Bruichladdich Distillery,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

These are followed by the fruity, rounded, soft notes of sweet oranges with a touch of candied fruit and vanilla.

‚Ä¢ Mouth: Silky, almost creamy on the palate, with beautifully-balanced notes of orange zest and of candied orange.

Champagne Brut Blue Top,"Tasting : This vintage is balanced, pleasant, approachable, so to speak.

Its primary aromas are of fruit, not just fresh fruit, but also candied fruits.
Mouth : The promise of the aromas in the nose is more than delivered by a round mouth, a subtle attack and good length. The mouth, like the nose, is dominated by fruit-peaches, cherry plums, and then oranges. Freshness, elegance and delicacy emerge gently throughout the entire tasting.

Hay & Sunshine Whiskey,"A meticulous mixture of Bourbon, Rye & Scotch

Honor Brand Is Born (again)

Before we knew it we had pictures of Honor Brand packages, Honor Brand advertisement and trade show displays, and a picture of the side of the building with a massive painted sign reading ‚ÄúThe house of Honor Brand.‚Äù And even better yet, honor brand‚Äôs slogan was ‚ÄúHonor Brand is better.‚Äù Compared to the unpronounceable and opaque marketing ideas Joel & Emily come up with themselves, this seemed awfully straightforward. And so, 100 years from the first Honor Brand, the new Honor Brand was born in the same halls.

After a whole lot of ball jars (have we mentioned how many ball jars there were?), Emily settled on ‚ÄúHay and Sunshine‚Äù for our first Honor Brand blend. It‚Äôs a mixture of bourbon, scotch and rye. The Bourbon gives it a sunny disposition, with its cheerful caramel, butterscotch and vanilla sweetness. The Scotch cuts the sweetness a bit, contributing a cereal grain character. Finally the rye, a more grassy than spicy example, evokes a freshly mown hayfield. Run through the field. Rear up on your back legs, toss your mane and neigh.

Plum Schnapps,"Schnapps"" are a general category for a strong cordial.

Pian Di Nova Toscana Syrah Sangiovese,"First produced in the early 2000s, Il Borro now has a very good 
track record with this entry-level red blend. The 2016 Pian di Nova 
is 75% Syrah and 25% Sangiovese that goes into mostly neutral 
barrique for 12 months. This happy vintage is particularly fresh 
and direct, with a real sense of brightness and energy in terms of 
its primary fruit. The wine is medium dark in appearance with a 
mid-weight feel and plenty of fresh fruit and soft tannins to follow. 
I can't imagine a better choice for your favorite pasta dish.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Food Style:

Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
‚Äì Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
‚Äì Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Ros√©,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Food Style:
To be drunk by itself, or with a wide range of dishes, including ones prepared with oriental spices.",,1786862,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632247/ca539c0d13c71b6391790.png?1616725890,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/C8WLQ,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Ros√©,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Ros√©

Gin,"Few gins unfold like Letherbee's flagship tipple ‚Äî a batch-made, grain-neutral spirit distilled with a clean yet robust blend of 11 botanicals, that macerate together for 3 days before distillation. Juniper berries spearhead a m√©lange of spices, including coriander, cardamom, and cinnamon, while cubeb berries evoke a touch of pepper and a hit of ginger in the finish. Dried lemon peel and orange pith lend the dry, balanced concoction a bit of room for keen drinkers to pick up subtle notes of licorice and almond. At 96 proof, Letherbee Gin shines in all contexts, whether sipped straight, louched with a few drops of water until slightly cloudy, or mixed in a refined cocktail. 

‚ÄúI believe a good gin should be able to stand up in an old-fashioned, make a good martini, and a good gimlet.‚Äù That is the basis for this 11 ingredient recipe that took two years to perfect. ‚ÄúOur gin makes bad tonic taste good"", says Brenton.

Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,"By looking at its saturated purple-black color, you can tell immediately that the 2012 Merus is a powerhouse of a wine. With even a little air, dark blackberry, tarry smoke, crushed violet, and charred beef fat aromas emerge. Once the masculine aromas escape the more subtle and delicate Coombsville characteristics become apparent, i.e. aromas of fresh black currant, sweet bramble vine, and cool wet stones. The mouth follows suit as it enters first with a thickness and a black fruit sweetness that one would expect from the initial aroma. Typical to its Coombsville pedigree, it never feels heavy as it fills every corner of your mouth. The 100% new oak provides structure and a pleasing toastiness but doesn‚Äôt overwhelm. This wine is still a baby and a bit disjointed as are many 2012s. With even a few more months in the bottle, it should become seamless and even more rich.",,1261561,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/858129/ce500a1b2fdba5a873897.png?1555320809,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/HB3RJ,,,,Merus,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,"Foley Family Wines, Inc",United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

10 Year Old Heavily Peated Malt Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Nose ‚Äì The smoke is calmed by the marine, ozone character,‚Ä®time has brought a balance, a harmony in the combination of oak, smoke and spirit. While the smoke is always discernible on the nose it is dry, earthy, peatash in its style and so allows the oak to come forward with waves of golden caramel, fudge, vanilla custard, hints of ginger, nutmeg and clove. There is citrus fruit, coaxed from the glass with a drop of water, gentle lemon meringue and clementine. Breathe deeply and the floral aromas of wild thyme, heather and sea pink bring you to this Atlantic coast.

Palate ‚Äì On the palate there is a noticeable delicacy and softness in texture and style. Again, the balance of flavour is superb as the smoke wraps loosely around the sweetness drawn from deep within the oak. Coconut, vanilla custard, lemon honey combines with smoked oysters and sun baked salty sand.

Finish ‚Äì The finish is sublime, smoky sure, but also the soft sweetness of fudge and malted barley, orange, mango and Banoffee pie hinting of the depth and quality of the oak. The many layers interchange on each sip. As the smoke comes and goes so too the notes of the spirit, ripe apple and apricot, beautifully intertwined with malt and oak sweetness and that typical Port Charlotte style dry smoke.

Character ‚Äì Ageing for 10 years on the shores of Loch Indaal has had a profound effect on this spirit. Like sunshine on a winters day, this Port Charlotte 10 brings clarity and lightens the mood, welcoming and brightening the future.",,1163562,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2290539/c954a4ecfcd7e26e527c9.png?1652211134,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/IH9UJ,,,,Port Charlotte,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Barbaresco,"Produced in Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive, Barbaresco is one of the great wines of Piemonte.

It is a late maturing grape which is very sensitive to different soils and climates, resulting in a fascinating range of flavors that are affected by the subtleties of the area‚Äôs microclimates. While much smaller than the Barolo area, Barbaresco benefits from the influence of the Tanaro river which results in Nebbiolo that ripens earlier and has a lighter character.",,1591674,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/324717/299b63436ab8e6d95881a.png?1616723389,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/XO5GF,,,,Produttori del Barbaresco,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Vias Imports,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Cabernet Sauvignon,"""Lush aromas of dried cherries and vanilla bean set the stage for blueberry notes, ripe plum and black tea flavors leading to a velvety mouthfeel and finish."" ‚Äî John Allbaugh, Winemaker

Vineyards. These Cabernet Sauvignon grapes come from our vineyards in California's Northern Interior which are known for their great fruit. These vineyards have well drained soils and plenty of heat to ripen the grapes beautifully. The long ""hang time"" creates the luscious richness balanced with the smooth finsh.

Fermentation & Aging. Individual lots of fruit were harvested separately according to ripeness and balance of acidity. The grapes underwent de-stemming and a very gentle crushing to ensure a large proportion of whole berries in the must contributing to the explosive fruit character of the wine. Fermentation was carried out in stainless steel tanks with select cultured yeasts. The wine was pumped-over twice daily and the temperature was controlled to an optimum 85¬∞F to extract rich color and flavor. The wines were pressed off their skins and racked twice before being put on American oak to add delicious flavors of vanilla and spice.",,1492543,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/560301/69e1e03260139555ee766.png?1543579909,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/MWVVY,,,,Red Truck Wines,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Bronco Wine Company,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Grenache En passerillage Santa Maria Valley,"Medium healthy red color, with nary a sign of brown at the rim. Nose of strawberry/rhubarb and peach, with a possible suggestion of citrus, viz. blood orange. Definite notes of autumnal spice - cloves, allspice and hints of sandalwood or other scented candle one might find in the boudoir of an ageing hippie. Good volume on the palate: the wine seems to expand with exposure to air in the way that inspirational Pinot/Burgundy sometimes does. Not at all densely tannic, but extremely persistent on the palate.

Then, in delicate harmony, the fat and smells of fresh almond and pear are revealed. The finish, based on a stony minerality, is prolonged on notes of very ripe lemon.",,1985875,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2968178/119ca985e1b3cf557d7da.png?1707233378,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/LFSZW,,,,de Ladoucette,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Maisons Marques & Domaines,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White
