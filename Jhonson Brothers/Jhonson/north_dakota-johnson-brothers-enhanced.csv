An Oa The Ultimate Non-Chill Filtered Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Color : Light Gold.

Aroma : Rounded and smoky - like burning Applewood - with creamy toffee, aniseed, treacle and dates. A curious suggestion of juicy fruits, such as peach and banana. With a drop of water, reminders of Ardbeg’s classic fragrance – lime, pine resin, fennel, saddle soap and tar. A gentle waxiness, like fragrant candle wax, and hints of smoked herbs. An Oa gives a final subtle reminder of the sea with briny notes and seaweed but always accompanied with creaminess.

Taste : A smooth, creamy texture leads into a huge syrupy sweetness, flavours of milk chocolate, treacle toffee, aniseed, orange and smoky tea leaves. Gentle, sweet spices (nutmeg & cinnamon), some cigar smoke, and a very unusual flavour of grilled artichokes. Wood is always present in the spirit, gently nutty and reminiscent of a carpenter’s workshop. A long, sweet finish, with floral overtones, mint toffee and some gentle malty biscuit notes.

Finish : Lingering, seductive, gentle yet intense, with flavours of aniseed, hickory and distant subtle smoke.",,1399469,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2056565/58bfa537035160e97f887.png?1632727975,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/RAOCR,,,,Ardbeg,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,Moët Hennessy USA,Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Brothers Small Batch Straight Bourbon Whiskey 90 Proof,"As brave pioneers, the Bowman family helped settle the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as well as parts of Kentucky.

In 1779, they led thirty pioneer families to Madison County, Kentucky and established Bowman’s Station. They were legends, admired and respected by fellow settlers for their courage and bravery.

This small batch bourbon has been distilled three times using the finest corn, rye and malted barley. A hand picked selection of a small group of barrels are married together to create a distinct and consistent flavor profile. An amazing bourbon.

An aroma of caramelized apples and nuts meets the nose. Its complex flavor has hints of vanilla and oak, while the finish is smooth and mellow.

18 Years Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky 100 Proof,"Colour : Apricot.

Nose : Beautifully fragrant with ripe peach and honeysuckle, hints of violet and lavender come through on the nose – balanced with vanilla and creamed coconut from the toasted American oak. A medley of tropical fruit comes to the fore, with melon, peaches, apricots, and vibrant citrus, while the influence of the oak brings honey, caramel vanilla custard and rich crème brûlée.

Palate : Luxurious and viscous, honey, butterscotch and fresh fruits coat the palate, followed by cereal notes of sweet, syrup soaked porridge, barley sugar and toasted oak. Vibrant tropical fruit and the subtle presence of toasted oak with a hint of leather follow, with honeycomb adding to the smooth, sweet character.

Finish : The quintessential character of Bruichladdich single malt comes through on the finish. The 18 Year Old has the classic minerality for which Bruichladdich is renowned, perfectly balanced with oak, stoned fruit and a delicate floral bouquet.",,1567639,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/3192117/ac234e303b37475cd2495.png?1719391442,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/D8YKB,,,,Bruichladdich Distillery,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

The Classic Laddie Scottish Barley Unpeated Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Character : Clean, fresh and lively. The oak and the grain work in perfect harmony.

Colour : Summer barley

Nose : Barley sugar and a hint of mint open before moving into freshly cut wild flowers; buttercup, daisy, meadowsweet, myrtle, primrose and cherry blossom. Delicate zephyrs of spindrift and sea pinks are a reminder that this spirit is matured exclusively beside the sea. Over time, and with the addition of a little water, caramelised fruit notes come to the fore, with hints of lemon drops, honey, tangerine and tablet.

Palate: Refined and refreshing, sweet oak and barley notes come together in perfect harmony. Ripe green fruits, brown sugar and sweet malt follow, showcasing the remarkable flavour of the Scottish barley used in this single malt.

Finish : Smooth and well rounded, the finish showcases the elegant balance between the sprightly, vibrant fruit and the subtle sea-spray notes.",,1753383,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/3193824/de0d6a5733a20f84edafb.png?1719476485,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/WZRI8,,,,Bruichladdich Distillery,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Food Style:
Perfect with all full-flavoured meat dishes, and ideal with traditional French cuisine as well as more international dishes whose flavours include a note of spice.",,1475380,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632162/e1bb17c9eb9dff1f0288d.png?1616725886,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/7ZUKL,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Rioja La Montesa,"*** WA""90""; James Suckling ""90"" ***; The average age of the vines is twenty-two years. The soil is comprised of sediments that stem from the quaternary era, consisting of clay and a stony-calcareous subsoil covered in gravel. The vines are narrowly spaced, pruned under a double cordon de royatstyle, farmed organically and very rarely irrigated. Hand-picked Garnacha, Tempranilloand Mazuelo clusters were selected, first in the field and again on a sorting table, before being de-stemmed and put separately into small stainless steel tanks for alcoholic and malolacticfermentation. After a long maceration of 23 days, aninitial blend was made and the wine was aged for 12 months in new and used 85% French and 15% American oak barrels. After the wine was clarified with natural egg whites, the unfiltered wine was bottled in May 2009",,1076210,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/311538/76b09cb8664ea2c40c8b4.png?1533277872,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/1HZFK,,,,Palacios Remondo,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Folio Wine Company,Spain,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

10 Year Old Heavily Peated Malt Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Nose – The smoke is calmed by the marine, ozone character, time has brought a balance, a harmony in the combination of oak, smoke and spirit. While the smoke is always discernible on the nose it is dry, earthy, peatash in its style and so allows the oak to come forward with waves of golden caramel, fudge, vanilla custard, hints of ginger, nutmeg and clove. There is citrus fruit, coaxed from the glass with a drop of water, gentle lemon meringue and clementine. Breathe deeply and the floral aromas of wild thyme, heather and sea pink bring you to this Atlantic coast.

Palate – On the palate there is a noticeable delicacy and softness in texture and style. Again, the balance of flavour is superb as the smoke wraps loosely around the sweetness drawn from deep within the oak. Coconut, vanilla custard, lemon honey combines with smoked oysters and sun baked salty sand.

Finish – The finish is sublime, smoky sure, but also the soft sweetness of fudge and malted barley, orange, mango and Banoffee pie hinting of the depth and quality of the oak. The many layers interchange on each sip. As the smoke comes and goes so too the notes of the spirit, ripe apple and apricot, beautifully intertwined with malt and oak sweetness and that typical Port Charlotte style dry smoke.

Character – Ageing for 10 years on the shores of Loch Indaal has had a profound effect on this spirit. Like sunshine on a winters day, this Port Charlotte 10 brings clarity and lightens the mood, welcoming and brightening the future.",,1163562,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2290539/c954a4ecfcd7e26e527c9.png?1652211134,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/IH9UJ,,,,Port Charlotte,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Champagne Brut Rosé,"The colour is a delicate pomegranate pink with very slightly orange reflections. The sparkling, light effervescence has a persistent foam.

The nose is subtle and fresh, first offering an original palette of tropical fruits (guava and lychee) and small berries (raspberries, cherries and wild strawberries) in the first instance. These are followed by rose and pomegranate notes which complete the complex, intense aromatic profile, dominated by somewhat undeveloped primary aromas.

On the palate the attack is distinct and full, cradled by a gentle effervescence. The aromas of freshly picked berries are fully expressed. The balance brings together a delightful freshness and voluptuous body, expressed by an elegant bracing touch of mint and pink grapefruit.

The Cuvée Irish Single Malt Whisky,"Conceptually inspired by Bordeaux's greatest chateaux. 25 distinct Waterford Single Malts, each a Single Farm Origin, are layered together in one bottling. Flagship bottling available globally. Our unique library of individual Waterford whiskies–derived from distinctive Irish terroirs –presents to us an unprecedented spectrum of natural flavours defined by Ireland’s soils & microclimates. Now, by layering such singular spirits together, each expressing its own identity, we alone are able to create this dynamic assemblage in which 25 individual Single Farm Origins coalesce to create The Cuvée. Thus beginning a new era for malt whisky. A celebration of a complexity only attainable from a fusion of individual terroirs, in this way– & in this bottle – we believe that the whole is greater than simply the sum of its parts.

Cask composition: 46% first fill U.S., 22% Virgin U.S., 15% Premium French, 17% Vin Doux Naturel.

This bottling features a bespoke label, commissioned from artist Leah Hewson.
