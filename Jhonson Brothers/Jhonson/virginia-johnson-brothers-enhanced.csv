Champagne Brut Blanc de Blancs Blanc Des Millénaires,"TO THE EYE : A pale gold colour with light green glints, and quite youthful, in contrast to the previous vintage.

ON THE NOSE : The chalky minerality of the Côte des Blancs is all-pervading. We detect toasted and smoky notes. When swirled in the glass, fresh citrus notes appear: grapefruit, yuzu and quince. They bring a cheeky youthfulness to this fine, delicate nose.

ON THE PALATE : The identity of the vintage is intertwined with a sharp and classy acidity, reminiscent of the 2004 vintage in its first flush of youth. An enveloping texture is then revealed with accents of lemon meringue pie and subtle saline notes. Its generosity is very prominent and will continue to develop with ageing.

Bordeaux Clairet Dry Rosé,"On July 17, 1453, the Battle of Castillon ended the ‘Hundred Years War’ and the British Army surrendered after three centuries of occupation. During this time, rich commercial exchanges occurred between France and Britain with the favored export being a clear, red wine that was greatly appreciated by British officers. This began a long history of Bordeaux winemakers supplying British society with their favorite wine. Locals continued to refine what many consider to be the ancestor of today’s modern Bordeaux wines and the traditional “Claret” was eventually awarded its own appellation, Bordeaux Clairet, Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. The grapes are cold-pressed and the juice is stored in concrete vats at a carefully controlled 64 
Fahrenheit. Skin maceration lasts for roughly 48 hours to enhance pink color extraction.

This “super” rosé has rose petals, dark cherries, and strawberries on the nose, with a generous weight on the palate and a round, refreshing finish.

Pinot Noir Valle del Cachapoal,"Contempo is defined as showing the latest style and from its inception, was created to appeal to the wandering palate of a youthful wine consumer.

The beauty of the Cachapoal Valley and the attractive qualities of the Peumo district brought a Northern Chilean family to purchase a vineyard there in 1824.

Prosecco,"KORBEL Prosecco is produced in the fully sparkling Italian spumante style. The process starts by harvesting the Glera grapes and gently pressing them to make a delicate, crisp white wine with only about 10% alcohol. After the first fermentation, multiple lots of the base wine are blended and filtered to prepare for the Metodo Martinotti sparkling wine process. The Metodo Martinotti process was invented in Italy, but is now known more popularly by its French equivalent, the Charmat process.
In the Metodo Martinotti process, the carbonation of the prosecco is achieved by a natural secondary fermentation in a stainless-steel tank. As the second fermentation progresses, carbon dioxide gas is produced, which builds pressure in the sealed tank. Eventually, the carbon dioxide dissolves into the wine. The wine is then filtered and bottled on specialized equipment that preserves the carbonation.",,1405230,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2555306/3bdd4cf9991bcedf3f12f.png?1677127965,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/0X0AG,,,,Korbel Winery,Wine,Sparkling,White,,johnson brothers,Brown-Forman,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,White

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White
GSM,"Vineyard Notes:

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Food Style:
Perfect with all full-flavoured meat dishes, and ideal with traditional French cuisine as well as more international dishes whose flavours include a note of spice.",,1475380,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632162/e1bb17c9eb9dff1f0288d.png?1616725886,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/7ZUKL,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Crémant de Bordeaux Brut Methode Traditionelle,"Maison Riche Crémant de Bordeaux Brut is a delicate blend of Merlot, Sémillon, and Cabernet Franc grapes that features light bubbles to start, a pale yellow color, and greenish highlights. Perfect as an aperitif or with dessert, this sparkler tends to open up in the glass and produces a higher volume of bubbles as it's enjoyed - leading to a slightly sweet, light, lingering finish.

Delicate pear, vanilla, and a hint of citrus on the nose, with tiny bubbles that present a slightly sweet palate, but a crisp, effervescent finish.

Côtes du Rhône,"Maison Riche Côtes du Rhône comes from the region of Châteauneuf-du- Pape in the Southern Rhône Valley. This wine is comprised of Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdre grapes, which provide jammy scents of red berries and spice, with a complex but silky-smooth mouthfeel. Perfectly fine to age for up to five years but being one of our favorites, our guess is that it won’t last
that long.

Blackberry, currant, and spices on the nose, with a light mouth-feel that presents more dark fruit on the palate, and well-balanced tannins.

Enjoy with Mediterranean dishes featuring red pepper and olives, roasted pork or poultry, or with your favorite cheeses and charcuterie.

Yecla Crianza,"In physics, quanta (plural) are the minimal amounts of any physical entity required to create an interaction with another. We consider Quanta the smallest batch, highest quality wine available from any given region that can create a positive and lasting interaction with the consumer. These hand-crafted wines have an innate ability to create sudden and significant appreciation. Whereas wines of this caliber are usually pricey, we have identified the ideal balance of quality and value to ensure that our Quanta meets the demands of your palate and lifestyle.

Since 1975, this family-owned winery in Yecla has been cultivating the Monastrell grape, and now has up to 400 hectares on its estate.  Monastrell (known as Mourvedre in France) is a perfect grape to adapt to the Yecla region because it can survive in the extreme conditions between winter and summer, including the long periods of drought.

A strong but supple backbone of fine tannins and oak balance the fruit and provide a hint of the long term ageing possibilities.

Barbaresco,"Nebbiolo has a two-fold soul: Barolo expresses strength and power, Barbaresco class and elegance. The Villadoria cellars have special ministerial permission to make and age Nebbiolo for Barbaresco outside the production zone. This authorisation has been granted to just a few historic Barolo zone wine estates and allows us to follow the whole wine making process. In Barbaresco, too, Villadoria’s style is traditional, in line with its Barolo concept. Large barrels and lengthy periods on the skins create a noble wine of incontrovertible elegance.


Production zone and characteristics
The grapes come from the Barbaresco, Neive and Treiso hills and part of San Rocco Seno d’Elvio d’Alba village. The specific sun exposure of the vineyards, their microclimate and clayey limestone soil, packed with tufaceous marls, create the ideal terroir for top quality grapes. The training system used is Guyot and yields are around 50 hectolitres per hectare.

 

Winemaking
The grapes are harvested by hand, destemmed and then crushed very gently. Alcoholic fermentation takes place in controlled temperature stainless steel tanks. The time on the skins varies according to vintage, from 15 to 20 days, during which time frequent pumping over helps the noble substances to be extracted from the skins. Malolactic fermentation occurs spontaneously after racking off.

 

Ageing
Like Barolo, Barbaresco needs time to express its potential to the full. The total ageing period is 26 months, of which 9 in medium sized oak barrels. During this period the wine’s polyphenols evolve considerably, and Barbaresco obtains a perfect balance between power and grace. Ageing potential is 10 to 15 years depending on vintage.

 

Tasting characteristics
A traditional Barbaresco, it is garnet red in colour with ruby highlights, and has an ethereal nose with rose and violet, red fruit jam, raspberry and also vanilla, nutmeg, white pepper and aniseed aromas. It is full-bodied in the mouth, with tannins which never predominate, and is balanced and long lasting.

 

Food pairings
Pasta dishes with meat sauces, red meat based, braised dishes and game, cheeses including matured cheeses.

 

Serving temperature
18-20 C°.  It is advisable to open the bottle an hour before serving.",,1598192,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/1240194/0837ec56df7526fbbd16d.png?1568668737,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/D9HR0,,,,Villadoria,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,WinesU,Italy,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
