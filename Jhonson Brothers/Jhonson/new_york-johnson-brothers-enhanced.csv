Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompanyall fish and white meat dishes. Will work well with oriental food.",,1475448,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632229/75901401cf822b4f1d3ff.png?1616725889,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/J9ULV,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White
GSM,"Vineyard Notes:

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Food Style:
Perfect with all full-flavoured meat dishes, and ideal with traditional French cuisine as well as more international dishes whose flavours include a note of spice.",,1475380,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632162/e1bb17c9eb9dff1f0288d.png?1616725886,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/7ZUKL,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Rosé,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Food Style:
To be drunk by itself, or with a wide range of dishes, including ones prepared with oriental spices.",,1786862,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632247/ca539c0d13c71b6391790.png?1616725890,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/C8WLQ,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Rosé,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Rosé
Sauvignon Blanc,"Vineyard Notes:
Years of experience have allowed us to identify those Languedoc vineyards, where the Sauvignon grape displays its most intense characters.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. A small amount of Marsanne added richness and complexity.

Tasting Notes:
The blending of a little Marsanne in with the Sauvignon has made this a very interesting wine with a refreshingly grassy green fig, papaya and lychee notes to go with the characteristic Sauvignon capsicum gooseberry flavours.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany all fish and white meat dishes. Will work especially well with seafood. Delicious by itself.
