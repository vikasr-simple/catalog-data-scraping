An Oa The Ultimate Non-Chill Filtered Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Color : Light Gold.

Aroma : Rounded and smoky - like burning Applewood - with creamy toffee, aniseed, treacle and dates. A curious suggestion of juicy fruits, such as peach and banana. With a drop of water, reminders of Ardbeg’s classic fragrance – lime, pine resin, fennel, saddle soap and tar. A gentle waxiness, like fragrant candle wax, and hints of smoked herbs. An Oa gives a final subtle reminder of the sea with briny notes and seaweed but always accompanied with creaminess.

Taste : A smooth, creamy texture leads into a huge syrupy sweetness, flavours of milk chocolate, treacle toffee, aniseed, orange and smoky tea leaves. Gentle, sweet spices (nutmeg & cinnamon), some cigar smoke, and a very unusual flavour of grilled artichokes. Wood is always present in the spirit, gently nutty and reminiscent of a carpenter’s workshop. A long, sweet finish, with floral overtones, mint toffee and some gentle malty biscuit notes.

Finish : Lingering, seductive, gentle yet intense, with flavours of aniseed, hickory and distant subtle smoke.",,1399469,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2056565/58bfa537035160e97f887.png?1632727975,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/RAOCR,,,,Ardbeg,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,Moët Hennessy USA,Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Barolo,"Behind the original concept for Barolo, there is the need to orient different shades in a single direction.

Nose : Notes of grapefruit, roasted pineapple enlivened with the vivacity of toasted and mineral notes. After several seconds, aromas of fresh fruits(apricots, vineyard peaches) briefly appear to give way to persistent notes of pastry.

Palate : The texture is truly the soul of Charlie, where we find that paradox of juvenile freshness and fleshiness, with a silkiness beifitting of a more mature wine. This 'dry fleshiness' is enhanced with a highly nuanced effervescence, composed of extremely harmonious bubbles. The finish reveals candied citrus and exotic passionfruit notes.",,1593254,3,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2772109/3ee4602c588c1ad748cdb.png?1695383624,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/W53LI,,,,Champagne Charles Heidsieck,Wine,Sparkling,White,,johnson brothers,Folio Wine Company,France,Alcohol,Wine,Sparkling,White

Rosso di Montepulciano,"While this wine is younger than the Vino Nobile, it still has nice structure and the ability to age for at least five years. Montepulciano stands on a height at the southern extremity of the Chiana Valley in the province of Siena. An ancient legend has it that Montepulciano was founded at the orders of the Etruscan king Porsenna. From its earliest origins, Montepulciano was linked with wine, as is indicated by a red-figure cylix (wine goblet) that was made in the Chiusi area. The cup is decorated with the figure of Flufluns, the Etruscan Bacchus or god of wine, who is shown, in company with a maenad, playing cottabos, a game in which drops of wine were flipped at a special target.

Harvest Date:	End of September.

THE VARIETAL
Grüner Veltliner dates from the roman times and its name translates to “Green Wine of Veltlin”. Veltlin is an area in northern Italy, a link hasn’t yet been found between the Italian commune and the grape varietal. The grape is believed to be indegenous to Austria. Grüner Veltliner’s name started to appear in the mid-1800’s, before that it was called Weißgipfler and it is in the 1930’s that Grüner Veltliner became its official name.
GREEN EYES
The grapes were hand picked at optimum ripeness at the end of September. The fruits come from several vineyards and selected in the cellar.
The bunches are pressed whole, the juice is then fermented slowly in temperature controlled stainless steel tanks.
The wine is bottled young in order to preserve the natural fruity flavors and the freshness from the grapes.",,1620617,12,1.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/1605600/52e06d1d8e6d0c9db1581.png?1592535777,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/94RMT,,,,Green Eyes,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Boutique Wine Collection,Austria,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White

Hay & Sunshine Whiskey,"A meticulous mixture of Bourbon, Rye & Scotch

Honor Brand Is Born (again)

Before we knew it we had pictures of Honor Brand packages, Honor Brand advertisement and trade show displays, and a picture of the side of the building with a massive painted sign reading “The house of Honor Brand.” And even better yet, honor brand’s slogan was “Honor Brand is better.” Compared to the unpronounceable and opaque marketing ideas Joel & Emily come up with themselves, this seemed awfully straightforward. And so, 100 years from the first Honor Brand, the new Honor Brand was born in the same halls.

After a whole lot of ball jars (have we mentioned how many ball jars there were?), Emily settled on “Hay and Sunshine” for our first Honor Brand blend. It’s a mixture of bourbon, scotch and rye. The Bourbon gives it a sunny disposition, with its cheerful caramel, butterscotch and vanilla sweetness. The Scotch cuts the sweetness a bit, contributing a cereal grain character. Finally the rye, a more grassy than spicy example, evokes a freshly mown hayfield. Run through the field. Rear up on your back legs, toss your mane and neigh.

La Vie en Rose,"La Vie en Rose is a dry, well attenuated, unspiced Farmhouse Ale refermented with the same raspberries used to make Jester King Atrial Rubicite. Naturally occurring wild yeasts impart a sense of place to this unfiltered, unpasteurized, 100% naturally conditioned beer.

The principle behind La Vie en Rose is to obtain a second extraction of fruit flavor and aroma from the raspberries previously used to make Atrial Rubicite. We noticed that after we made our first batch of Atrial Rubicite, the raspberries still had a lot of nice flavor and aroma. We had also read the following on Brasserie Cantillon’s website, which mentions a second fruit extraction involved in making their Kriek: 

“Two barrels of Kriek from the first extraction and two from the second are pumped into a huge barrel. (The second extraction is obtained by filling the barrel for a second time in order to extract as much from the fruits as possible).”

Based on this information, we experimented with aging a pale, medium-strength, farmhouse ale in a stainless steel tank with the raspberries previously used in the refermentation of Atrial Rubicite. Over the course of about two months, the beer picked up color, flavor and aroma from the raspberries, as well as flavor and aroma compounds produced by additional fermentation. As we’ve mentioned before, we’re most interested in fermenting fruit in a manner similar to how grapes become wine, rather than simply adding fruit or fruit flavoring to filtered and/or pasteurized beer. The former technique has the ability to create new and interesting flavors and aromas through the wonderful process of fermentation, whereas the latter is less natural and quite predictable. 

The total fermentation time for La Vie en Rose is approximately four months. During the first month, the beer was fermented with our house blend of brewer’s yeasts, Brettanomyces yeasts, naturally occurring wild yeasts native to our land in the Texas Hill Country, and souring bacteria prior to the addition of fruit. It then spent the next two months refermenting with raspberries, followed by a final month refermenting in bottles, kegs and casks. Like everything we brew at Jester King, La Vie en Rose was given lots of time so as to ferment to complete dryness. It finishes at 6.2% alcohol by volume, with a final gravity of 1.000, and a pH of 3.8.

Chianti Classico (Blue Label),"The color is an intense ruby red with faintly garnet tones. The initial aromatic sensations are sweetish and vanilla-like, typical of wines matured in barriques. The clean, ethereal bouquet then highlights Sangiovese’s spicy notes.

Chianti Classico Vigneto Di Campolungo Gran Selezione,"Its color is a deep ruby red with a faint garnet tinge. Its aromas are the extremely distinctive ones of Sangiovese: the fundamental notes are those that characterize a Chianti Classico of breed: iris, spices (pepper) and wild berries. On the palate, the oak, held at bay by the wine’s ample fruit, leaves room for nuances of preserves and of spices, which are in perfect harmony with the bouquet.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Chardonnay,"Vineyard Notes:
We have selected vineyards in the area of Carcassonne and the Minervois based on grape flavour and yield. The wines are produced and bottled in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The grapes were cold macerated then pressed, cold settled before fermentation. 30% of the Chardonnay was fermented in French and American oak barrels, and remained on lees in barrel, with some stirring, for six months.

Tasting Notes:
Chardonnays come in many styles, from light and minerally to rich, buttery and oaky. We wanted to make a Chardonnay that was satisfying, yet fresh, and with a sufficiently interesting flavour to capture the imagination. From the outset, it was crucial that it would be a great accompaniment to food. This is a fresh, pine-appley wine, with a subtle hint of oak and a touch of mango and ginger

Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon.

The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

Blanco Tequila,"Mi Campo Blanco Tequila is a contemporary take on traditional agave tequila.

10 Year Old Heavily Peated Malt Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Nose – The smoke is calmed by the marine, ozone character, time has brought a balance, a harmony in the combination of oak, smoke and spirit. While the smoke is always discernible on the nose it is dry, earthy, peatash in its style and so allows the oak to come forward with waves of golden caramel, fudge, vanilla custard, hints of ginger, nutmeg and clove. There is citrus fruit, coaxed from the glass with a drop of water, gentle lemon meringue and clementine. Breathe deeply and the floral aromas of wild thyme, heather and sea pink bring you to this Atlantic coast.

Palate – On the palate there is a noticeable delicacy and softness in texture and style. Again, the balance of flavour is superb as the smoke wraps loosely around the sweetness drawn from deep within the oak. Coconut, vanilla custard, lemon honey combines with smoked oysters and sun baked salty sand.

Finish – The finish is sublime, smoky sure, but also the soft sweetness of fudge and malted barley, orange, mango and Banoffee pie hinting of the depth and quality of the oak. The many layers interchange on each sip. As the smoke comes and goes so too the notes of the spirit, ripe apple and apricot, beautifully intertwined with malt and oak sweetness and that typical Port Charlotte style dry smoke.

Character – Ageing for 10 years on the shores of Loch Indaal has had a profound effect on this spirit. Like sunshine on a winters day, this Port Charlotte 10 brings clarity and lightens the mood, welcoming and brightening the future.",,1163562,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2290539/c954a4ecfcd7e26e527c9.png?1652211134,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/IH9UJ,,,,Port Charlotte,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

9 Years Old PMC: 01 2013 Heavily Peated Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky,"Character : This release marks the first time we’ve matured Port Charlotte spirit in Pomerol casks, and the result is really special. The quality of the oak paired with the versatility of the spirit is remarkable, and the flavour pays homage to both the wine region of the cask and the spirit’s all-inlay maturation. It showcases the harmonious balance between oak, rich fruit and gentle peat smoke – an unforgettable single malt.

Colour : Haze

Nose : Warm peat smoke and red fruits open on the nose, moving to stewed pears, melon and a subtle marine note. Delicate floral notes of rose and geranium follow, with hints of vanilla, honey, leather and toasted oak coming from the wood. As the spirit opens further, a subtle spice mix of clove and ginger comes to the fore, with a touch of marzipan.

Palate : Malt sugar and peat smoke complement the tremendous viscosity of the liquid which coats the palate. The influence of the cask continues and showcases the harmonious balance of oak and fruit, with succulent blackberries, plum and aged leather. 

Finish : Mellow marine tones, crushed seashells and a hint of citrus lemon rind nod to the single malt’s all-Islay maturation while Port Charlotte’s signature peat smoke lingers.",,1841691,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/3187749/879a43b329f181cbf521c.png?1719211684,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/ILBHI,,,,Port Charlotte,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch,,johnson brothers,"Remy Cointreau Usa, Inc",Scotland,Alcohol,Spirit,Whiskey,Scotch

Barbaresco,"Produced in Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive, Barbaresco is one of the great wines of Piemonte.

It is a late maturing grape which is very sensitive to different soils and climates, resulting in a fascinating range of flavors that are affected by the subtleties of the area’s microclimates.

Pinot Noir Rosé Dundee Hills,"WINE OVERVIEW
Pinot Noir Rosé has been a cornerstone of our
production for more than a decade. Comprised of
various clones of Pinot Noir, we intentionally craft our
Rosé to be balanced and bright.
Whole cluster pressed and fermented in stainless steel,
our 2019 Willamette Valley Pinot Noir Rosé shows

fruits. The palate displays flavors of watermelon and
strawberry lemonade with mouthwatering acidity. The
lingering notes of minerality on the finish will draw you
back for another sip.
HARVEST OVERVIEW
The 2019 vintage was a return to a classic Oregon
growing season. Bud break, bloom, lag phase, and
harvest dates all fell within days of the 2013 and 2014
vintages. Our estate crop set on target with expected
levels for all varieties. Moderate summer weather
persisted, presenting very few heat spikes and delivering
only one notable record-breaking day in June. Cool, wet
weather arrived early in September, pushing ripening
and delaying the harvest window. The conditions in
late September and October returned to sunny days
and brisk nights, allowing us to pick based on ripe fruit
flavors and near-perfect natural acidity.

Over 25 years later, the process remains the same; Tito’s is made in batches, with each batch taste-tested, and goes down smooth with an impeccably clean finish. Let’s raise a glass to 25 more years of sharing the Tito’s spirit. *(Average Analysis per 1.5oz Tito’s Handmade Vodka: 98 calories, Carbohydrates 0 grams, Protein 0 grams, Fat 0 grams)",,1344426,60,50.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2627036/790322a5e5fa939f24b68.png?1684177573,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/311M9,,,,Tito's Handmade Vodka,Spirit,Vodka,Vodka,,johnson brothers,"Fifth Generation, Inc",United States,Alcohol,Spirit,Vodka,Vodka

4 Years Old Family Estate Bottled Small Batch Straight Rye Whiskey,"The barrels that went into this small batch combined to make an amazing drinker.
Nose- Beautiful layering of brandied cherry over a mildly tart cherry. It opens up with time and is reminiscent of cutting into your dessert with your fork which releases cinnamon and baking spices with just a hint of oak to remind you that this is high proof youthful.
Palette- A robust rye with dark cherry, burnt vanilla, and spices for days. It's a delicious rye with a weighty mouthfeel. 
Balance - It's insanely well balanced with the alcohol so perfectly integrated at 115 proof you'll forget its there, but you'll find yourself smiling more and happier with each dram.
Finish- the finish is long and the spices dominate this batch, while the cherry does punch its way through to the surface.

Château Du Nozet Pouilly-Fumé Baron De L,The winemaking chais is made up of three levels. The first level is where the grapes are received and sorted without crushing keeping the grapes from the different parcels separate. The juice then flows (without pumps or screws) simply by gravity to the second level where the pressing with the division of the juice à la champenoise takes place. The third level is where the wine is clarified using a cooling system to regulate the temperature of the juice with maceration pulpaire. This wine is fermented in stainless steel vats thermostatically regulated to 18ºC for 6-8 weeks. This wine is on lees for 3-6 months with regular agitation. The wine is never placed in wooden barrels in order to preserve the natural aromas of the grapes.,,1109182,6,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2475942/cc4bf83c49d679e8ed7ba.png?1667310706,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/501IY,,,,de Ladoucette,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Maisons Marques & Domaines,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White
