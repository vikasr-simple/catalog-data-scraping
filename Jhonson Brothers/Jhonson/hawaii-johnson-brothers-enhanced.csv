Brothers Small Batch Straight Bourbon Whiskey 90 Proof,"As brave pioneers, the Bowman family helped settle the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia as well as parts of Kentucky. This hand-crafted bourbon whiskey is a tribute to the original Bowman brothers from Virginia. John, Abraham, Joseph and Isaac Bowman were Virginia militia officers in the American Revolutionary War. In 1779, they led thirty pioneer families to Madison County, Kentucky and established Bowman’s Station. They were legends, admired and respected by fellow settlers for their courage and bravery.

This small batch bourbon has been distilled three times using the finest corn, rye and malted barley. A hand picked selection of a small group of barrels are married together to create a distinct and consistent flavor profile. An amazing bourbon.

Champagne 1er Cru Brut Blanc de Blancs,"VINEYARDS & WINEMAKING: Champagne Collet’s vineyard sources are in Premier and Grand Cru villages that reflect the diversity of Champagne’s terroirs. The fruit comes from 850 growers spread over 160 different crus (there are a total of 320 crus in Champagne). However, winemaker Sebastien Walasiak uses no more than 10% of the overall vineyard yields. Sebastien blends the base wines of the classic Champagne varieties from hundreds of individual vineyards and several vintages – vital, because blending is the ultimate art of Champagne and is the key to maintaining Champagne Collet’s incomparable house style. The wines are aged far beyond the minimum requirement in the winery’s 100-year-old chalk cellars resulting in softer wines needing less dosage. 

TASTING NOTES: This generous and supple champagne is made of 100% Chardonnay from six crus, the majority of which are in the renowned Côte des Blancs region. Aged for a minimum of five years.

Passione e Sentimento Romeo & Juliet's Wall Passimento Rosso,"Pasqua Romeo & Juliet Passimento embodies Verona. Juliet’s Balcony where she called out to Romeo is a historic site in the heart of Verona. Over 3,000 love messages are left on the wall leading to her ancestral and still standing home in downtown Verona. Our label is a snapshot of this wall, a living piece of art in Verona and testament to true love.

Wine Details
Made in the appassimento style (similar to Amarone), the three different grapes are left to dry for a month in wooden crates in a dry, well-ventilated environment. There, the grapes lose 30% of their water content, increasing the sugar concentration. Separate stainless-steel fermentation is followed by three months of oak maturation before blending. The final blend undergoes malolactic fermentation to harmonize and soften the wine.

Vineyards / Region
Hillside areas of Valpantena in the northeast part of Valpolicella

Tasting Note
Concentrated and complex, intense lingering aromas of red berries with spicy overtones. Balanced palate with velvety tannins and a soft, round finish.

Food Pairing
Pair with red meat, game or aged cheeses.

Chardonnay Here And Heaven Sta. Rita Hills,"Artist Notes
The wine was allowed to ferment naturally on its own yeast in French oak barrels and aged in the same barrels for 10 months. Bottled July 19th, the goal was to capture all of the wine’s illuminating citrus and tight mineral backbeat. These crisp, lively flavors have constantly reminded me of the treble laden sounds of mandolin and banjo juxtaposed against each other, which is why I chose the Bluegrass inspirations of Chris Thile’s song Here and Heaven to represent the musical direction that I feel the wine expresses.

On The Palate
Here and Heaven is all about treble, with high, lilting scents of lemon thyme, Thai basil and white citrus blossoms. On the palate, an energetic burst of citrus, Meyer lemon and mandarin orange dominating. A sweet pecan lifts in the mid-palate, with a subtle hint of honeysuckle, finishing with soft textures of melon and lime curd.",,1868069,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/2066770/60d1afeae5a60ae805987.png?1633686016,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/NTQ10,,,,La Voix,Wine,Still,White,,johnson brothers,Palmina Wines,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,White

Chardonnay SRH Sta. Rita Hills,"The Santa Rita Hills is a small appellation at the western
end of the Santa Ynez Valley that has gained national
recognition for its Pinot Noir and Chardonnay.

The Valley runs west to east, opening a gap in the coastal
range, allowing the late afternoon ocean fog to roll in
where it lingers until early morning. The surrounding hills
trap the fog before it is dissipated in the wider Santa Ynez
Valley.

The fog cools the vines from the day’s summer heat and it
is this combination of warm days and cool nights that gives
the wine its complexity as well as providing acidity to give
it structure.

On the palate, the oak, held at bay by the wine’s ample fruit, leaves room for nuances of preserves and of spices, which are in perfect harmony with the bouquet.

Cabernet Sauvignon,"Vineyard Notes:
The grapes, selected from low yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking notes
The two varieties were vinified separately. Both went through a period of cold soak. fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes
The blend of rich blackcurranty Cabernet and brambley, gently peppery Syrah makes this a very distinctive wine. The vanilla character of the oak is present but subtle, and the tannins are softer than in many Cabernets. A very luxurious drink; silky and satisfying.

Food Style
Good with a range of red meat dishes, but its soft fruity character makes this an attractive wine to drink by itself.",,1019166,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632154/ece19705d11b2f47880b5.png?1616725885,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/6RE1M,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

Winemaking Notes:
The three varieties were vinified separately . All went through a period of cold saok. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was very limited use of press wine.

Tasting Notes:
The blend of grape varieties gives spicy blackberryish flavours, dark plum, black cherry dark fruit and a hint of pepper. There is also a distinctive mineral, perfumed note that comes from the Mourvedre.

Perfect with all full-flavoured meat dishes, and ideal with traditional French cuisine as well as more international dishes whose flavours include a note of spice.",,1475380,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632162/e1bb17c9eb9dff1f0288d.png?1616725886,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/7ZUKL,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red
Pinot Noir,"Vineyard Notes:
From the coolest area (Limoux) of the South of France influenced by the fact that it is: 
– Situated at the foothill of the Pyrenees rising to 400 meters above sea level
– Sea breezes both from the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean

Strong viticulture control: starting with defined Clone selection aimed at obtaining low yields, good canopy management helping produce ripeness. The rows are grassed down to avoid excessive vigour. In tourist terms, Limoux is considered the Tuscany of the South of France.

Winemaking Notes:
Made in a very Burgundian manner. The whole bunches went through a period of cold soak. Fermentation on skins lasted 2 weeks prior to pressing. There was Burgundian-style manual punch-down to break up the cap and maximise colour. Very little press wine was used.

Tasting Notes:
A very distinctive and immediately enjoyable Pinot Noir, this is a very juicy, raspberryish, cherryish wine with hints of strawberry and oak and a refreshing note of pepper.

Food Style:
Great by itself or to accompany a wide range of meat dishes, but could also be enjoyed with fish such as tuna or salmon. 
Serving note: Would be good slightly chilled, especially in warm weather.",,1345432,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/632200/f94390b2ba2dfb2c9105a.png?1616725888,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/L72J1,,,,Le Grand Noir,Wine,Still,Red,,johnson brothers,Prestige Beverage Group,France,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Red

The grapes, selected from low-yielding vines, come from the areas of Carcassonne and the Minervois, in association with Celliers Jean d'Alibert.

Winemaking Notes:
The Shiraz and Grenache grapes were picked at optimum aromatic ripeness then briefly cold macerated. The grapes were then pressed and only then was the clear juice racked. The wine remained on less 3 months before being prepared for bottling.

Tasting Notes:
Pale pink. Intense aromas of raspberry, strawberry and redcurrant with a hint of pepper. Rich palette with refreshing bright red fruit and peppery character. Apparently dry, with attractive fruit-sweetness.

40% GRENACHE, 30% CARIGNAN, 25% MOURVÈDRE, 5% CINSAULT

VINEYARDS
We kick off harvest every year mid-August by picking the Grenache. It’s always a bit disarming that the clusters have not yet completely gone through verasion in this vineyard of tall gnarly vines set in deep white sandy soil, and this year it was even more so. One of our consistently favorite wines, we love inhaling the jasmine and citrus flowers, watching the journey through fermentation from something that resembles an orange Julius through feisty tangerine pith to a clean, fresh, edgy wine. A couple of baby birds were uncovered in a nest as we picked, the beginning for them too!

A week later during a beautiful sunrise and by the beat of the music played by one of our pickers, the Carignan vineyard planted in 1906 came in with low yields. In the tank the aromatics and flavors moved through iterations of guava and golden raspberry into bright cranberry with great acid. We were fortunate to secure another ancient Carignan vineyard, with a very similar concentrated flavor profile.

Labor Day was during one of the warmest weekends of the summer, bringing in the final three vineyards in the days that followed. The wine from the young Mourvèdre vineyard in Brentwood displayed significant minerality early and the Ripkin Mourvedre offered roses and flower petals–truly lovely at each stage of its development.

Our final pick again this year was the Bechthold Cinsault—this treasured wine from 150 year old vines journeyed through flavors of green apple to ripe honeyed Bartlett pears over several weeks and was such a treat to taste.

Harvest Notes: Hand picked between August 15 and September 7 at 18-20 Brix.  An uneven berry set increased our vigilance and lowered our yield this year across the board.

WINEMAKING
With each pick, the clusters were pressed into separate, cold stainless steel tanks for long, measured fermentations. Blending occurred in early October followed by bottling 5100 cases in late December. 11.4% Alcohol

TASTING NOTES
The 2017 literally shimmers in its barely-there hue with irrepressible perfume of flower petals and lemons. Intense acidity, bright citrus, jicama, and white peaches are anchored on the palate by prominent minerality and a crisp, mouthwatering finish.",,1130477,1,5.16,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/430434/393faeeccc446107d3e9e.png?1538980068,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/LUZ79,,,,Lorenza,Wine,Still,Rosé,,johnson brothers,Lorenza Rose,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Rosé

The wine from the young Mourvèdre vineyard in Brentwood displayed significant minerality early and the Ripkin Mourvedre offered roses and flower petals–truly lovely at each stage of its development.

Our final pick again this year was the Bechthold Cinsault—this treasured wine from 150 year old vines journeyed through flavors of green apple to ripe honeyed Bartlett pears over several weeks and was such a treat to taste.

Harvest Notes: Hand picked between August 15 and September 7 at 18-20 Brix.  An uneven berry set increased our vigilance and lowered our yield this year across the board.

WINEMAKING
With each pick, the clusters were pressed into separate, cold stainless steel tanks for long, measured fermentations. Blending occurred in early October followed by bottling 5100 cases in late December. 11.4% Alcohol

TASTING NOTES
The 2017 literally shimmers in its barely-there hue with irrepressible perfume of flower petals and lemons. Intense acidity, bright citrus, jicama, and white peaches are anchored on the palate by prominent minerality and a crisp, mouthwatering finish.",,1854795,12,750.0,,,,,https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.sevenfifty.com/product-images/large/430434/393faeeccc446107d3e9e.png?1538980068,,https://johnsonbrothers.storefronts.site/p/LUZ79,,,,Lorenza,Wine,Still,Rosé,,johnson brothers,Lorenza Rose,United States,Alcohol,Wine,Still,Rosé
