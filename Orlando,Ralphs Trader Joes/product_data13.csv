"080148","Perfect Bar Chocolate Mint","According to his thirteen children, Dr. Bud Keith was a ""health food guy"" before ""health food"" was a thing, 
constantly tinkering with healthy recipes to feed his king-sized family. As the story goes, one day, he ground 
up a bunch of dried fruits and vegetables, mixed them with freshly ground nut butter and honey, took one bite 
and declared, ""It's Perfect!"" -and with that simple exclamation, Perfect Bars® were born.

Available in our stores for the fall and winter seasons, Chocolate Mint Perfect Bars® are sweet, moist, and 
satisfyingly dense, with an irresistible, melt-in-your-mouth texture. They're made primarily of organic peanut 
butter, and flavored with peppermint oil, organic dark chocolate, and a mix of organic dried whole food 
powders. The Bars are cold-pressed (not baked) and don't contain any added preservatives or emulsifiers-and 
because of this, they should be kept in the refrigerator so their flavor and consistency remain intact. They can 
last up to one week at room temperature, so you can toss one in your purse, backpack, or workout bag to fuel 
you for the day ahead!

"079890","Vegetable Root Chips","Now here are some Chips you can really Root for! Trader Joe's Vegetable Root Chips take the traditional 
potato chip concept and add a Peruvian twist. Instead of your regular Russets, our supplier in Peru starts with 
three Root Vegetables that are grown in-country: Taro (deep red), Cassava (speckled white), and Sweet Potato 
(pale orange). These colorful Vegetables are sliced thin and fried in sunflower oil until exquisitely crisp, with a 
very bold crunch. They're finished with just the right balance of sea salt to accent their variety of subtle, earthy 
flavors. 

Trader Joe's Vegetable Root Chips are definitely delicious on their own, when you're in the mood for something 
salty & crunchy. And their firm, broad surfaces are also well-suited for dipping into just about anything you can 
think of. Start with your favorite TJ's hummus, or our Chunky Spicy Guacamole Autentico [sku 96621], then 
move on to something slightly off the beaten snack-path, like TJ's Chicken Bacon Ranch Dip [sku 79675], or

"079722","Pink Lady Apple Chips","Is it possible for an apple to be an overachiever? Pink Lady® apples would say yes. As the first apple cultivar to 
blossom and the last to be harvested, they soak up about 200 days of sunshine before landing in your kitchen. 
As a result, they boast an especially crisp bite, rosy-blush color, and balanced, sweet-tart flavor-flavor that's 
amplified in Trader Joe's Pink Lady® Apple Chips.

It all starts in Washington state, where our supplier harvests the Apples at peak freshness. They're thinly 
sliced, then vacuum crisped until delightfully crunchy. What's vacuum crisping, you ask? It's a gentle frying 
method that uses a vacuum-sealed chamber to crisp the Apples at low temperature with minimal oil, helping 
preserve and magnify their flavor. They're topped off with a dusting of cinnamon sugar, culminating in sweet, 
effervescent Apple Chips with a paradoxically juicy finish. 

Snack on gluten free Pink Lady® Apple Chips right out of the bag, or crumble them over Plain Whole Milk 
Greek Yogurt [sku 69707] or French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576] (perhaps with Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce

set the bar for how sublimely simple a trail mix could be. With just a minimalist mix of peanuts, almonds, 
raisins, and candy-coated milk chocolate gems, every bite contains a remarkable medley of flavors and textures, 
which is why it's remained a solid gold hit with our customers for nearly 25 years. So how does one celebrate 
such a bar-setting snack? How about by recontextualizing it into a new setting: a highly snackable Bar? 

Proudly made with the same constituent components as the Trail Mix that inspired it,  Trader Joe's Rainbow's 
End Trail Mix Bars are held together with a bit of tapioca syrup and a rich coating of dipped dark chocolate on 
the base. Like its predecessor, each Bar offers a nice mix of crunchiness from the roasted peanuts and almonds, 
a bit of tenderness from the plump raisins, and some fun, flavorful sweetness from the candy-coated milk 
chocolate, all of which is captivatingly complemented by the dark chocolate layer. We find it's ideal for enjoying 
before work or school, during a hike or long car ride, or after a run or gym day.

"075842","Nuts About Elote Mix","Ah, for the multitude of sweet, smoky, and savory flavors contained within a single serving of elote. Arguably 
one of the more successful street foods in all of global cuisine, elotes as we most commonly know them today 
(grilled corn with butter or mayonnaise, cheese, lime juice, and chile powder) originated in Mexico, with roots 
to pre-Columbian indigenous cuisine-the world ""elote"" comes from the Nahuatl ""elotitutl,"" for ""tender cob,"" 
in fact. Drawing inspiration from this utterly iconic antojito, Trader Joe's Nuts About Elote Mix is made with  
crispy, puffed corn kernels and roasted cashews, dusted a cheesy, peppery, elote-evoking seasoning blend, 
along with pepitas and pretzel sticks to provide some complementary crunch.

Ideal for snacking on while catching the big game, enjoying a tall, frosty beer, or simply lounging about on a 
weekend, Trader Joe's Nuts About Elote Mix combines the sweetness of corn on the cob, the spice of chile 
powder, and the zesty zing of citrus in a whole new, crispy-crunchy context. It makes an excellent hors d'oeuvre 
for a cocktail party, and serves sensationally well alongside a cheese plate.

combination that caused our tasting panel to kick their heels in delight when they tasted-and approved!-our 
latest seasonal nut offering, Trader Joe's Cinnamon Sugar Cashews with Honey & Brown Sugar.

To create this simple yet satisfying snack, our Thai supplier takes impressively sized, slightly salty Cashews 
and gilds them with a sweet glaze imbued with plenty of Cinnamon and Brown Sugar, along with honey to 
round out the warm, sugary notes. Packed in a totable canister, the sweetly spiced, buttery crunch of these 
eminently snackable Cashews is enjoyable during all manner of autumnal pursuits, from weekend tailgating 
and entertaining, to the slightly less exciting (but no less important) weekday work-commuting and homework-
helping. Snack on them right out of the canister, or serve alongside wedges of TJ's Toscano Cheese with Cinnamon

humble wheat cracker can be counted on in all kinds of culinary contexts, including (and perhaps especially) 
enjoying as a standalone snack. It's been a while since we've carried such a cracker on our shelves, and the time 
felt right to reintroduce one to our snacks section-we just had to be sure that the one we brought in was as 
satisfyingly crispy as those we've enjoyed in the past, while still substantial enough to hold up to heavy-duty 
cheese slices and hearty dips. After a few rounds through our tasting panel, we knew we had it with Trader 
Joe's Wheat Crisp Crackers.

Made for us by a Canadian supplier, who bakes each Cracker to a crispy, crunchy, gloriously golden brown, our 
Wheat Crisp Crackers make a capital companion to any cheese plate or charcuterie board, where their subtle 
blend of savory and sweet can complement even the most complex of flavor profiles. They more than hold 
their own when used to scoop up hummuses and other savory dips, and take particularly well to being topped 
with fruit spreads, cream cheeses, and combinations thereof, too. And, of course, they're also great for simply 
snacking on while catching up on a TV show, or catching up with a friend.

latest snack sensation: Organic Coconut Crunchy Clusters.

Made for us in Sri Lanka, these Clusters are quite the textural treat. Organic toasted Coconut chips, nutty 
sunflower seeds, earthy pumpkin seeds, and mild chia seeds provide complex crunch and seedy flavor, while 
cane sugar and rice syrup meld the Coconut chips and seeds into their final sweet and snackably Clustered 
form. 

Organic Coconut Crunchy Clusters make for a sweet and nutty treat right of the bag, but their enjoyment 
certainly needn't be limited to solo snacking. Mix them into Greek Nonfat Coconut Cream Yogurt [sku 53649]

crisp exterior, the light and airy interior, the stick-to-your-teeth richness of it all...it's nothing short of sensory 
splendor on the palate. So when you pair that tactile, textural expression with a nice mix of tart, tangy, and fiery 
flavors-now you're really cooking. And that's precisely what's offered by Trader Joe's Chile Lime Flavored 
Fried Pork Rinds, a sensationally savory, citric, and spicy take on this classic, captivatingly crunchy snack.

Inspired by our very own Chile Lime Seasoning Blend [sku 56662], these positively piquant Pork Rinds start 
with antibiotic-free pork skin that's been dehydrated then fried until it's crispy, crunchy, and delightfully curly.  
Then, our supplier seasons them with a series of spices including chile pepper, paprika, and garlic powder, as 
well as a mix of lemon and lime juices, resulting in a snack that's salty, sour, spicy, and remarkably rich, all at 
once. We recommend snacking on them while watching the game and enjoying an ice-cold beer, dipping them 
in guacamole or queso fundido for a phenomenally full-flavored treat, or even crushing them up and using 
them as super savory breadcrumbs for mixing into meatloaf, topping macaroni and cheese bakes, or using as a 
breading for a pan-fried pork cutlet.

seen street vendors peeling juicy mangoes, sticking them on wooden skewers, slicing them to look like roses, 
and covering them in lime juice, salt, and chile powder. It's an art unto itself that, although delicious, isn't so 
suitable for carrying in your bag on the go. Fortunately, our supplier in Mexico crafted this fruity delight into 
Trader Joe's delectable and snackable Chile Seasoned Dried Mango!

With juicy and nearly fiber-less flesh, Kent Mangoes are especially soft and full of Mango flavor when Dried, 
making them the ideal choice for Chile Seasoned Dried Mango. Our organic Kent Mangoes are grown in 
Mexico and harvested at the peak of ripeness, then dried, cut into strips, and coated with Chile powder, salt, 
cane sugar, and citric acid. The resultant snack is simultaneously sweet, tart, salty, spicy, and Mango-forward.

Chile Seasoned Dried Mango is excellent right out of the bag and alongside other dried tropical fruit like 
pineapple and papaya. You can also pair it with Crispy Crunchy Coated Peanuts [sku 75236] for a Mexican-

Dark Chocolate Chips are an excellent option for bakers of all experience levels-especially those looking to 
limit their sugar intake.

Made with flavorful dark chocolate from Colombia, as well as sugar-free allulose and rich cocoa butter, these

chips. From dependable desserts like chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and blondie bars, to break-out breakfasts 
like pancakes, muffins, and banana breads, to even just spontaneously snacking on by the handful, these No

lifting to your mouth when you need something yummy to give you a boost!

The Barebells brand of protein bars was launched in 2016. Since then, the company has been doing the 'heavy 
lifting' when it comes to developing high-protein snack bars that really deliver on the flavor. The latest addition 
to their lineup, and the latest addition to our bars section, is a limited edition, awesomely autumnal Pumpkin 
Spice Protein Bar, made with a blend of protein sources including milk, soy, and bovine collagen.

Its flavorful mix of unsweetened chocolate and pumpkin spice flavors make it a great seasonal snack, while 
its protein blend makes it an equally great pre- or post-gym pick-me-up, boasting an impressive 20 grams of 
protein (!) per Bar. We recommend keeping one or two on hand at the office, in your bag, or even in the glove

however, is shortbread and apples. There's just something about that mix of lush fruitiness and dense, buttery 
texture that's undeniable-so much so, in fact, that we've enshrined it into a seasonal sweet treat in the form of 
Trader Joe's Apple Shortbread Cookies.

Made for us in small batches by a supplier in the U.K., the recipe for these scrumptious Shortbread Cookies

A decidedly delicious (not to mention deciduous) way to celebrate autumn, these crispy, crunchy, leaf-shaped

some tri-colored tortilla chips, these chips get their warm, sunset hues from ingredients like beet, carrot, & 
pumpkin powders. 

Enjoy these festive, fall-colored chips dipped in TJ's Fall Harvest Salsa [sku 55306] or TJ's Extra Hot Habanero

"078498","Chile Crackers","Here's a hot tip for the next time you host: there's no better way to spice up a cheese plate or charcuterie board 
than actual, literal spice. And that's precisely why we've brought Trader Joe's Chile Crackers to our shelves. 
They're made for us by an esteemed supplier in the U.K., using a recipe that ups the crunchiness and peppery 
heat in every bite. It all results in a super crisp Cracker that acts as a capsaicin-loaded complement to all sorts 
of cheeses, sliced meats, and dips.

In fact, we find that they're perfectly-sized for stacking with your favorite cheeses, charcuterie, and flavorful 
accessories to create custom, canapé-esque hors d'oeuvres. Just imagine a deep orange (courtesy of tomato 
powder) Chile Cracker piled with a slice of Triple Creme Brie [sku 55406], a bit of Prosciutto [sku 98861], 
and a smidgen of Organic Apricot Preserves [sku 75418]. Or, if you want to totally lean in to the heat, a Chile 
Cracker topped with our Cheddar Cheese with Scotch Bonnet Chili [sku 72426], Uncured Applewood Smoked 
Salami [sku 59152], and a drizzle of Spicy Honey Sauce [sku 76116]. Of course, you also can't go wrong simply 
enjoying our Chile Crackers as a sensationally spicy anytime snack.

"075236","Crispy, Crunchy Coated Peanuts","Originally invented by Japanese immigrants in Mexico, where they're known as cacahuates japoneses or maní 
japones, Japanese-style peanuts might just be the most superlatively crunchy snack in the long history of human 
snacking. They're traditionally made by coating dry-roasted peanuts (which are already quite crunchy) in a 
savory-seasoned, flour-based batter, then cooking them until they're resonantly, reverberatingly, remarkably 
crunchy. That's certainly the time-tested formula our supplier uses to make Trader Joe's Crispy Crunchy 
Coated Peanuts-and to resoundingly delicious results.

A little salty, a little sweet, and with a nice note of umami throughout (courtesy of the soy sauce in its wheat-
and-rice-flour coating), Trader Joe's Crispy Crunchy Coated Peanuts' delightful flavor, satisfying texture, 
and even their appealingly acoustic qualities make them a true triple threat of a treat. We're especially fond of 
bringing them along on long road trips, toting a bag along on a hike, or simply enjoying them while having a 
pleasant afternoon in, studying, reading, or playing a board game. We also recommend pairing them with a 
nice cool beverage, like an ice-cold iced tea, or a frosty glass of light, golden beer.

"077876","Ranch Seasoned Cashews","There's a reason ranch dressing is consistently named one of the top condiments in the country: as it turns out, 
you can pretty much never go wrong combining creamy textures with savory, aromatic herbs. Of course, this 
being Trader Joe's, we simply can't help ourselves from putting an axiom like that to the test-this time, in the 
form of Trader Joe's Ranch Seasoned Cashews. They're made with crunchy roasted cashews dusted with a 
classic Ranch-style seasoning blend that includes garlic powder, onion powder, and even powdered sour cream 
and buttermilk.

In addition to being a reliably fantastic anytime snack, our Ranch Seasoned Cashews also make an excellent 
inclusion in cheese plates, where their pronounced pop of herby flavor provides a great contrast to creamy 
Bries, tangy Bleus, and sharp Cheddars. Bring them along on hikes, long car rides, and sporting events for a bit 
of delicious diversion. We find that their Ranch-rich, slightly salty profile also makes them especially apt for 
enjoying alongside an ice-cold beer or a refreshingly fruity mocktail.

cookie, the softness of the chocolate, even the sound of the crunch all have a tendency to take one back to a 
simpler time. Our tasting panel certainly found that to be true of Trader Joe's Gluten Free Crispy & Crunchy 
Chocolate Chip Cookies, every bite of which offer all the time-transporting tastes and textures you could want 
in a classic chocolate cookie-and all without the inclusion of any gluten.

There used to be a time when folks felt the need to qualify gluten-free foods as being ""good...for gluten free."" 
Nowadays, though, gluten free alternatives have made such strides that it practically goes without saying: 
these Chocolate Chip Cookies aren't just good for gluten free-they're good, period! And especially so when 
packed in school lunches, enjoyed as an afternoon snack, or used to make creamy ice cream sandwiches. We 
recommend pairing a Cookie or two with a glass of ice-cold milk, or your favorite non-dairy beverage, to truly 
maximize that like-a-kid-again feeling.

"077559","Milk Chocolate Covered Gummy Bears","Once upon a time in 1920s Germany, a confectioner by the name of Hans Riegel tinkered with gelatin and fruit 
flavors to create a soft gummy candy unlike anything seen before. Inspired by the dancing bears at German 
festivals, he molded his invention into a bear shape that gained worldwide popularity over the decades that 
followed. Fast forward to today, and Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate Covered Gummy Bears evoke charming, 
chocolatey nostalgia in every bite! 

Gummy Bears may be German, but Milk Chocolate Covered Gummy Bears are a purportedly Swedish
creation that's difficult to find outside of specialty shops.  So, we partnered with an expert Swedish confectionery

and chewy gummy a cocoa-covered bear hug. With an assortment of gummy bear flavors, each handful is like 
a box of fruity chocolates-you never know what you're gonna get (but it'll certainly be delicious!).

These Gummy Bears are delightful right out of the bag and as adorable accoutrements for desserts. Stick a few

"076670","Mango Sticky Rice Crisps","It would be difficult to overstate just how delicious a plate of mango sticky rice can be. From that refreshing 
initial bite of the buttery sliced mango, to the soft, chewy texture of the coconut milk-saturated rice, to the 
way those contrasting flavors and textures play off of one another on the palate, it's an unquestionably top-tier 
dessert. The question that Trader Joe's Mango Sticky Rice Crisps asks is ""can a top-tier dessert also become a 
top-tier snack?"" We're confident that every satisfyingly sweet and crunchy bite of these Crisps will answer that 
question with a resounding, ""Of course! It's Mango Sticky Rice! What can't it do?!""

Made for us by an expert supplier Thailand, Trader Joe's Mango Sticky Rice Crisps are made with a mix 
of sticky rice, coconut milk, sweetened dried mango, mango syrup, and sesame seeds. Each bite evokes the 
tropical sweetness, bright fruity flavors, and faint, toasty nuttiness of this classic, Southeast Asian sweet treat, 
while adding the textural twist of overt crunchiness into the mix. Aside from making a truly excellent anytime 
snack (which they do with aplomb), these Crisps are also great for enjoying as a show-stealing amuse-bouche 
between bites of charcuterie, deploying as a mini-dessert for a spicy, savory meal, or idly crunching on while 
watching a movie or catching up on your shows.

Well, that's what we call a must-try, confection tri-fecta! It's also what we call Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate

These Cookies are, indeed, made for us in France. The usual cookie-dough suspects-flour, sugar, egg yolks,

Organic Turkish Apricots [sku 37994], and conventional Dried Apricots [sku 32350]. Now, we've added another 
option that brings a Simply Amazing profile to our dried apricot line up. 

Large, Dried Apricots-of the juicy, Suphany variety-ripen in the sun to a blush-orange hue, while also 
developing a rich, honey-like sweetness. Once harvested, they're carefully dried in the summer sun by our 
trusted Turkish apricot supplier (and by Mother Nature, of course). What really makes these Dried Apricots 
Simply Amazing is the final step, which involves a gentle steaming. This unique method yields unbelievably 
Soft Apricots with a tender, chewy, almost velvety texture. Each bite of these reddish gems presents a floral, 
candy-like quality that is tempered by a pleasant tang.

Because they are harvest-dependent, we're offering Trader Joe's Simply Amazing Soft Dried Apricots only

varieties.

Taking a simple recipe, real citrus flavor, and baking it into graceful little crisps with delicately scalloped edges, 
Trader Joe's Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins are bound to put a pleasant pucker on your lips. And don't think of

Originating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile 
we draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they're generously seasoned with the 
pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers 
stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to 
the real deal. 

To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your 
cheese of choice-we're partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese [sku 077726]. Add cold cheese slices for 
a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina 
Montepulciano D'Abruzzo [sku 048838]), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs 
and cozy gatherings with family and friends. Any way you slice it, Pizza Seasoned Crackers make for fun and

for us in small batches from an awesomely old-fashioned recipe, these delicately crunchy confections start 
with layers of crispy, flaky, lightly salted peanut butter, which our supplier then surrounds with a thin (and 
also rather crispy) candy layer. As you eat them, you can choose to let the layer dissolve on your tongue before 
biting through the crisp, sweet-savory, peanut butter center, or expedite your sweet-eating experience into one 
resounding, satisfying *crunch*.

Available on our candy shelves for  a limited time, Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Pillows make for a marvelous 
movie snack, a captivating game-day concession, and a superb sweet treat to bring along on road trips and 
plane rides. We also find that they make a rather fun inclusion into other sweets and baked goods: the next 
time you make cookies, try pressing one into the center of  each cookie before baking for a melty, pleasantly 
peanut butter-y result.

Jalapeño heat.

These crisps are made for us by a supplier in Thailand, who thinly slices and lightly batters Jalapeño peppers, 
then fries them to a crisp, golden brown. Just like their onion-based counterparts, we find that these Crispy 
Jalapeño Pieces are particularly great for adding texture to casseroles and bakes (just think of a Jalapeño-

the ideal edible instrument on which to serve cheese. They're traditionally made by rolling savory-seasoned 
dough into a flat, roughly rectangular, tongue-like shape, then baking them until they're superlatively crisp and 
snackable. For Trader Joe's Green Olive Flats, the newest addition to our snacks section, our supplier in Italy

cheeses: they provide a salty, savory boost when spread with our Triple Cream Brie [sku 55406], create a 
complementary conversation on the palate when eaten with a slice of herby Asiago with Rosemary and Olive 
Oil [sku 94533], and accentuate the allium elements of our English Cheddar with Caramelized Onions [sku 
52381]. Of course, that goes even farther when compounded with some smoky charcuterie, like our very own 
Prosciutto [sku 98861]. And if you just happen to find yourself in need of a savory, crisp cracker, sans meat or 
cheese, our Green Olive Flats are always an excellent option.

"078881","Dark Chocolate Covered Pistachios","For just a moment, consider the complementary nature of dark chocolate and pistachios with us, won't you? 
In terms of flavor, there's the earthy, delicately sweet notes of a finely roasted pistachio, which plays remarkably 
well off of the rich, ever-so-slightly bitter elements of dark chocolate. And texture-wise, the tooth-sinking 
smoothness of dark chocolate superbly rounds out a pistachio's tender interior after its initial, delicately snappy 
bite. It's like they were made for each other-a match made in snacking heaven, if you will. We certainly will, 
which is precisely why we've introduced Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Pistachios to our shelves.

Inside each pouch, our supplier has smothered shelled, dry roasted, and salted California Pistachios in a 
perfectly proportioned layer of deep Dark Chocolate so that each balanced bite takes your taste buds on a trek 
across the sweet-salty spectrum. They make an unbeatable anytime snack, can be mixed in to your own custom 
trail mixes, and are especially adept for adding to charcuterie boards and cheese plates, to provide even more 
captivating contrast. We also find that they make the ideal palate cleanser for serving in between sips at an at-
home wine tasting with friends.

only Trader Joe's Bacon & Eggs Shaped Sweet Gummy Candies. 

Our Bacon & Eggs Shaped Gummy Candies might look like small, sunny-side up eggs and little pieces of 
pink-ish bacon, but that's about where the similarities end-because this batch of Bacon & Eggs is soft, chewy, 
and decidedly sweet, not savory. The ""Bacon"" pieces are cherry-flavored, the ""Eggs"" taste a bit like mango, and,

stores. They were certainly delicious, but at Trader Joe's, we're all about kaizen-and we knew there was room 
for improvement. Now, many months and several versions later, we're excited to introduce the chocolatey 
manifestation of our sweetest efforts: Trader Joe's Double Chocolate Wafer Cookies.

Made for us in Italy, these bite-sized, cubical Cookies contain four layers of a hazelnut-infused, chocolate cream 
filling sandwiched beteween delicate, crispy, cocoa wafers. They're certainly simliar to those aforementioned 
branded chocolate wafers, but they're even crispier and boast a richer, even more chocolatey flavor. They're 
perfect as a small, sweet snack-on-the-go and/or an excellent companion to a cup of coffee or tea. You'll find 
8.8-ounce bags of Trader Joe's Double Chocolate Wafer Cookies in our cookies & candy section.

"077301","Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips","In Scandinavia, rye has been a staple since at least the Middle Ages. But why rye? The key to rye's rise lies in this 
grassy crop's ability to flourish in a colder climate. It also had to do with rye's dense, earthy, and pleasantly sour 
character when milled and used in baked goods. Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips capitalize on 
rye's goodness by delivering this dark, delicious grain in a crisp, seedy cracker.

A bakery in Norway makes our Sourdough Rye Chips. First, they bake bread from a wheat and rye sourdough 
that includes whole-grain rye berries, sunflower seeds, and flax seeds. The bread is thinly sliced, fried in 
sunflower oil, and finished with a touch of salt. Each curved, irregularly shaped Chip has a super crunch that 
leads to nutty notes and rich rye flavor.

We enjoy Trader Joe's Norwegian Sourdough Rye Chips as a snack right out of the bag, but you can also 
use them to add crunch to your salad. And they're strong enough for dipping into something savory, such 
as Chunky Artichoke Jalapeño Dip [sku 54698]. For a more substantial snack, pair them with Oak Smoked 
Salmon Pieces [sku 71117] and thin slices of Denmark Havarti [sku 09356]. You'll find the 4.6-ounce bag on 
our shelves, every day.

Made for us in Turkey with three simple ingredients-red bell peppers, yellow bell peppers, and sea salt-
our Oven Dried Bell Pepper Crisps are an ideal anecdote to a sudden craving for some savory crunch, sans 
additives. Our supplier takes a 50/50 blend of fresh (not frozen) Bell Pepper slices, sprinkles them with sea salt, 
then dries (not fries) them in not one, but two separate ovens. (Perhaps we should have gone with Double Oven 
Dried?) The first pass through the oven prepares the peppers by slowly reducing their moisture levels, and the 
second dries them to peak crispiness. Snacks don't get anymore straightforward than this...

food that's evolved into a celebrated American classic. Its creamy, tart, citrusy custard and buttery graham 
cracker crust combo was the hit of the summer. Then, in July 2015, we upped the ante and introduced TJ's Key 
Lime Tea Cookies [sku 55131] to the table, literally and figuratively. Now, as spring makes way for summer, it's 
time for lime once more. Trader Joe's Key Lime Tea Cookies are back. 

This year, we're sourcing our Key Lime Tea Cookies from a cookie manufacturer that happens to specialize in 
Tea Cookies. Along with sporting a new look (check out the summery packaging!), these Cookies are tangier 
and more flavorful than ever, without the addition of any ""extra"" ingredients. After all, these bite-sized delights 
measure just over an inch in diameter, so there is only room for the essentials: powdered sugar, flour, butter, 
key lime powder (made from dehydrated lime juice), and natural key lime flavor-nothing more. It's like you 
baked them at home, except¿ you did not bake them at home, so you and your kitchen can remain cool on hot 
summer days. 

Sit back, relax, and allow Trader Joe's Key Lime Tea Cookies to cool your countenance with sublime, refreshing, 
sweet-tart flavor. You can enjoy them alone, or you can serve them alongside a cup of your favorite TJ's tea. Or, 
to make it really interesting, wash them down with a cold glass of Organic Jalapeño Limeade [sku 58825].

We've seen similar lime cookies out there, but those have ""extra"" ingredients and sell for about two dollars more 
than our Key Lime Tea Cookies, which are priced at $3.99 per 10-ounce box. But take note: Trader Joe's Key 
Lime Tea Cookies are seasonal, and only in stores for the summer. The time for lime is now!

Ideal for chocolate-lovers, coffee-lovers, and especially chocolate-and-coffee lovers, each 0.88-oz. Bar

Its rich flavor, easy-going texture, and buzz-worthy bolt of caffeine make it a great after-dinner option: like

"096844","Freeze Dried Raspberries","The process of freeze drying is a rather fascinating one-especially when applied to fresh fruit. In the case of 
Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Raspberries, for example, it's done by freezing ripe raspberries, then lowering the 
atmospheric pressure around them to near-vacuum levels. After this, they're heated, which causes a curious 
reaction where the frozen water within the berries instantly transitions to a vapor, skipping the liquid phase 
entirely. And since raspberries are mostly water, what remains of each raspberry is super concentrated with 
their signature, sweet-tart flavor-in fact, it takes more than a half a pound of fresh raspberries to make each 
1.2-ounce pouch of our Freeze Dried Raspberries.

But you didn't come here for a science lesson-you came here because you love sweet, crisp, fruity snacks! And 
that's precisely what Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Raspberries are. Every bite is bursting with bright, ever-so-
slightly floral raspberry notes, making them an an excellent, anytime snack, and an ideal inclusion for school 
lunches. We also find that they make an excellent accessory to other dishes-try them as a baking ingredient, 
a fruity boost for smoothies, or as topper for a bowl of cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt.

"077330","Milk Chocolate Covered Honeycomb Candy","Honeycomb candy-or ""sponge candy,"" ""seafoam candy,"" or ""cinder candy,"" depending on what part of the 
world you're in-is a classic confection composed of sugar, honey, and baking soda . Nowadays, most versions 
found at specialty candy shops or online (when you can find them, that is) aren't actually made with honey-but 
they are accompanied by a formidable price tag. So you can imagine our delight when our product developer 
presented what is now Trader Joe's Milk Chocolate Covered Honeycomb Candy to the tasting panel!

To craft this nostalgic treat, a thick syrup of sugar and honey is first boiled, and then combined with baking 
soda when it's removed from heat. The mixture is poured into trays, and as it cools, the baking soda dissolves, 
leaving behind air pockets (reminiscent of a Honeycomb!) that create the Candy's signature appearance and 
delightful, airy-yet-crispy texture. The aromatic, deep golden Honeycomb Candy is then bathed in rich Milk 
Chocolate, creating an irresistible juxtaposition of creamy and crunchy textures and caramel and chocolate 
flavors that's quite enjoyable on its own, or when paired with a strong cup of tea.

us to entertain the idea of a cookie assortment for the warmer months... which led us to one of our long-time 
cookie suppliers in Belgium... which led to the creation of Trader Joe's Belgian Cookie Assortment!

The package contains two sealed trays to help maintain cookie crispness, in case the group you're entertaining 
isn't large enough to eat a whole box of 42 Cookies. Each tray includes three different types of Cookies, all 
made using a traditional, all-butter recipe. There are Lemon Flavored Waffle Cookies with a bright flavor and 
satisfying texture. There are classic Almond Butter Thins (the very same Cookies we've been selling every day 
since 2004 [sku 67005]) that are thin and crisp, with scattered slices of almond. This Assortment also includes

"077338","Savory Squares","The cheese cracker is a time-honored treat, a classic savory snack for kids and adults alike. However, it's not 
always an option, dietarily speaking, as most tend to be made with gluten and dairy ingredients. That's where 
Trader Joe's Savory Squares come in. Made with a mix of nut and seed flours, these superbly snackable Squares 
achieve an unmistakably Cheddar-y cheesiness and satisfyingly crispy crunch, all without the use of any gluten 
or animal-based ingredients. Things in the Trader Joe's snack aisle are really shaping up!

Excellent for everything from simple, everyday snacking to scooping up your favorite creamy dip, these Savory 
Squares are ideal for bringing along on road trips, toting to board game nights, or packing into school lunches. 
They can be enjoyed totally on their own, as a standalone snack, or mixed in with other savory treats, like our 
Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets [sku 12564], to craft your own custom snack mix. And when crushed up, they make 
a fun, flavorful, and gloriously gluten free alternative to breadcrumbs for breading fried chicken, schnitzel, or 
all manner of crispy, crunchy appetizers.

Cookie Thins [sku 90993]-two light and crispy classics of TJ's cookiedom that have delighted customers and 
Crew for more than 15 years. After a decade and a half of deliciousness, the time seemed just right to add a 
third Cookie Thin to the ranks-and believe us, this new version is well worth the wait...

Made for us by the same celebrated supplier, Trader Joe's Vanilla Cookie Thins have the same satisfying 
textural snap as their Meyer Lemon and Triple Ginger cousins, with mild, pleasantly aromatic Vanilla flavor in 
every bite. With their pale golden color, delicately scalloped edges, and visible flecks of vanilla bean, they're 
both attractive and tasty additions to any dessert platter. They also make excellent accompaniments to after-
dinner cups of coffee and tea, and able accessories to ice cream sundaes. They can even be crumbled to make a 
particularly flavorful crust for a pie or cheesecake!

them eminiently portable and entirely enjoyable, without the need for a straw!

Our Taiwanese supplier knows well the ways of Boba, which originated in their country circa the 1980s. You 
can think of this candy version as a deconstructed bubble beverage, where the center of each piece is precisely 
that pearl (aka tapioca ball) that usually lives at the bottom of your Boba cup. Each individual, caramelized-
brown-sugar flavored pearl is surrounded by a creamy coating, then given a classic Japanese rice-wrapper 
treatment.

The result of this mash-up is a soft & chewy Mochi bite revealing a delightfully gooey center that's bursting 
with brown-sugar Boba beverage flavor. Only here, no straw is required-just a bag of Trader Joe's Brown 
Sugar Boba Mochi, and a mouth ready to receive this innovative, Asian-inspired candy!

the 17th century creation, candy-coated Jordan almonds. At what point or how the two merged into the sweet, 
brightly flavored jelly beans of today is anyone's guess. Could it have been as simple as pure luck? 

Speaking of luck, Trader Joe's Gourmet Jelly Beans come from a wee candy factory nestled in the Irish 
countryside. These colorful Beans are made just for us using fruit and vegetable extracts for color. They're 
bright with naturally vibrant, sweet flavors and 18 distinct profiles, from pomegranate to pink grapefruit. Close 
your eyes and take a lucky guess on which flavor is which; or combine two or three Beans to mix flavors like 
strawberry & banana or coconut & lemon. You have plenty Gourmet variations to choose from. Our Jelly 
Beans are flavored through and through, so you get more flavor in every bean. Lucky indeed.

We're selling each five-ounce box of Gourmet Jelly Beans for $1.99* in our candy aisle. This really is your

"005985","White Cheddar Popcorn","Gone are the days that you need to head to the neighborhood cinema or get to a gourmet confectioner's shoppe 
to indulge in a decadent, yet airy treat such as Trader Joe's White Cheddar Popcorn. While we think these 
cheddar-coated puffs would make a great snack alongside other confectioner treats or while curled up to watch 
a movie, you can now do so without ever leaving the couch (except to head to the pantry and grab the TV 
remote, that is).

Trader Joe's White Cheddar Popcorn is a special hybrid variety of white corn grown in Nebraska. The corn 
is air popped at just the right temperature to ensure that each kernel pops up big and tender. The distinctive 
aged cheddar flavor is all natural. It comes from a special blend of cheddar cheese and oil. And as with all of 
our Trader Joe's labeled products, we include absolutely no artificial colors or flavors. Everything down to 
the packaging is thoughtful of the product and shopper; Trader Joe's White Cheddar Popcorn comes in a 
bag made of special packaging film that protects the popcorn from light, which would otherwise disrupt the 
popcorn's taste and freshness.

"050953","Honey Roasted Peanuts","A singing symphony of sweet and savory flavors full of nutty and floral tones, Trader Joe's Honey Roasted 
Peanuts may just be the ultimate bar snack. Intoxicatingly crunchable and munchable with friends late into the 
night, you won't remember how many handfuls, or how many beers, you've had once the bag is empty! 

As a snack, they're a sweet & salty source of dietary fiber, carbs, protein, fat, and vitamins and minerals. Our 
Honey Roasted Peanuts contain an array of complex carbs, simple carbs, and a good hunk of fiber. With 
the peanuts supplying the complex carbs and fiber themselves, the added honey provides the simple sugars. 
Additionally, each handful helping has high levels of unsaturated fats and minerals such as iron, magnesium, 
potassium, and folate. 

All of these nutritional benefits are great, but let's be real, we're more concerned with Trader Joe's Honey 
Roasted Peanuts being the tastiest, most craveable snack you can keep around (or can't because you eat them 
all in one go). The sweet and salty flavor combo satisfies a craving for both at once. The flavorful ""candied"" 
peanuts coated in salt will have you saying ""one more handful"" all night.

"074086","Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack","Light, crispy, and utterly abounding with umami, roasted seaweed is perhaps as close to perfect as a snack 
food can get. But even that level of near-perfection can be improved upon, especially when that improvement 
involves a dash of spicy, savory seasoning and a crunchy tempura coat. Need proof? Look no further than 
Trader Joe's Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack! They're made for us by a supplier in Thailand, who takes sheets 
of nori harvested from a seaweed farm in Korea, dips them in savory, starchy tempura batter and fries them 
until they're superlatively crisp, then finishes them off with a fiery, togarashi-inspired seasoning blend. Each 
and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.

Trader Joe's Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack can be enjoyed totally on its own, as a companion to sports 
spectation, movie marathoning, or any other occasion that calls for something satisfyingly crunchy. It also 
makes a remarkably apt chip for scooping up all kinds of savory dips-although we're particularly partial to 
pairing it up with other maritime flavors, like ceviche or our very own Vegan Poke [sku 74770]. And is if that 
weren't enough, it also lends a tremendous pop of texture when crumbled over salads, soups, and rice bowls.

"090083","Roasted & Salted Rosemary Marcona Almonds","True Marcona Almonds are grown only on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.  They're shorter and flatter than 
California almonds, with a distinctive flavor and a light, crunchy texture. We've taken that flavor profile a step 
up by adding whole dried rosemary to the mix. The nuts are roasted in expeller pressed sunflower oil, dusted 
with sea salt and sprinkled with whole rosemary. They're a real treat. You can use them in recipes (just the 
thought of Green Beans Rosemary Marcona Amandine makes us smile), present them as an hors d'oeuvre or 
eat them right out of the bag. They're excellent with a glass of crisp white wine - perhaps a Sauvignon Blanc 
or Côtes du Rhône. We've found them to be quite difficult to resist; you may want to err on the side of caution 
and have several bags on hand in case of emergencies.  And napkins.  You'll need napkins. Trust us on this one.

Marcona Almonds tend to be expensive, but at Trader Joe's, we have them at a great price. We're selling Marcona 
Almonds with Rosemary in six ounce bags for the terrific everyday price of $5.99* each.

Joe's Cheery Lemon Animal Crackers to the list! It's not just their name that makes these Crackers so Cheery. 
In fact, the actual cheeriness of these Crackers came first, prompted by the bright yellow yogurt coating and 
rainbow-colored nonpareils-aka crunchy candy sprinkles. (Incidentally, all the happy hues in these Crackers 
derive from simple sources including vegetable juice, beta-carotene, and turmeric.)

The grinspiration of these Crackers is further found in the chipper crunch of their lightly sweet, cookie-like 
character. Multiplying this mirth, each Cracker is cut into one of 13 unique & gladsome Animals, including: 
bears, elephants, cats, donkeys, goats, tigers, lions, horses, cows, rhinos, camels, bison, and hippos. And the 
capstone of this trouble-tromping Trader Joe's treat is its creamy, yogurt coating, with authentic citrus aroma 
& lemony zing.

May we mention one more aspect of Trader Joe's Lemon Animal Crackers that is sure to elicit cheer? It's the 
single-serving package that virtually invites itself along on all your daily excursions, whether big or small, near 
or far. Hip, hip, hooray for Cheery Lemon Animal Crackers!

ordered-the Peas are sour, the Carrots are sweet, and the whole harvest is delicious!

Unlike many Gummy Candies on the market, our Peas & Carrots are made without the use of gelatin or 
artificial colors. Instead, their chewy, gummy texture comes courtesy of fruit pectin, and they get their spring-y 
green and orange hues from spirulina, paprika, and fruit & veggie juice. Speaking of which, you'll also be 
pleased to know that, in spite of their name and likeness, these Peas & Carrots taste like fruit (citrus, to be

your cone upright at all times,"" or ""Better to buy two cones, than to try to share one with a friend."" While 
these are definitely excellent cone tips, perhaps the most excellent cone tips we could possibly provide for our 
customers would be Trader Joe's Hold the Cone Tips.

Of course, now we're talking about a product, not a piece of advice. Patently styled after our iconic Hold the 
Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones [skus 57185, 57186, 62834, etc.], which are found in our freezers, these Cone Tips 
are cookies, not ice cream. In effect, we've removed the entire top portion of the cone (including the ice cream), 
leaving behind a conical nugget, the crunchiest part or the Waffle Cone, where the seam comes to a point. 
Their colossal crunch is complemented by a rich filling of smooth, dark chocolate-not unlike what you find 
at the bottom of our Mini Ice Cream Cones.

Another point we'd like to make-and what may really tip the scales for serious serial snackers-is the fact 
that these Cones Tips require no refrigeration. That's right, they're 100% portable, and ready to eat anytime 
you need a Tip to top-off a meal, or to counter a savory snack with the crunch of something sweet. One final

magnitude. This the-more-the-merrier spirit is at the heart of Trader Joe's Brookie Caramel Candy Clusters, 
an impressively indulgent sweet treat that's now available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

Each Cluster is made with a mix of broken-up bits of brownie and chocolate chip cookie, which are held 
together with a generous dollop of rich, gooey caramel. This, in itself, would make an exceptional confection, 
but it's just the beginning. Our supplier enrobes the base of each caramel-cookie-brownie combo with melted 
dark chocolate, then drizzles it with even more dark chocolate, before finishing with a light sprinkle of sea salt. 
It all results in an awesomely epicurean eating experience that's ideal for enjoying as a movie candy, including

No. 00358 as pictured on the packaging, of course.

Each Puff is powdered in a savory and tangy dusting of sour cream and onion seasonings. This flavor combo is 
wonderful for a tasty lunch side, a late afternoon snack, or best of all: tear open a new bag as you start a movie

provide such a pleasant pop of umami? The answer is surprisingly simple, yet nonetheless satisying-which, 
appropriately enough, are two descriptors we'd also apply to our Piquant Popcorn. Inside each bag, our supplier 
has dusted light, fluffy, butterfly popcorn with a blend of onion powder, garlic powder, sea salt, and nutritional 
yeast, which gives each piece a rich, tangy, and faintly cheesy flavor.

With that in mind, you may ponder still: what's the best use for such a prodigiously Piquant Popcorn? Aside 
from making a great anytime snack (which it does more than proficiently), our Piquant Popcorn's unique 
flavor makes it an excellent accompaniment to a charcuterie board, and a primo palate cleanser when tasting 
wine or cheese with friends. The next time you're hosting a get-together, keep a bowl of our Piquant Popcorn 
out for your guests-and when their interest is piqued, you'll know exactly what to tell them.

"078295","Pizza Party Potato Chips","Remember back when you were a kid, and the mere promise of a pizza party felt like a life-changing event? 
With Trader Joe's Pizza Party Potato Chips, we may have just encapsulated that feeling into a crispy, crunchy, 
satisfyingly bite-or, we should probably say, three bites. That's because each bag of our limited-edition Pizza 
Party Potato Chips contains a mix of three classic, kettle-style chips in three distinct flavors: rich and aromatic 
Cheese & Garlic, hearty and lightly spicy (and vegetarian, by the way) Pepperoni, and tangy, delicately 
sweet Pizza Sauce. When eaten together, this trio of flavors coalesces into a singular eating sensation that 
enthusiastically evokes the essence of a slice of pepperoni pizza. In other words, each bag is a portable Pizza 
Party, just waiting to happen!

An ideal accompaniment to game-day get-togethers, movie nights, or indeed any situation that calls for 
something fun and flavorful to munch on, Trader Joe's Pizza Party Potato Chips turn the act of everyday 
snacking into a savory celebration. We recommend serving them with our fresh Buttermilk Ranch Dressing 
[sku 74462]-who can resist a classic pizzeria pairing like pizza and ranch, after all? And, in addition to their 
proficiency as a party snack, the'y're a great side with sandwiches and burgers of all kinds.

"076825","Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets","The next big sensation in savory snacking at Trader Joe's proves that good things come in small packages: say 
hello to Trader Joe's Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets! These delicious, diminutive morsels of super crispy Mochi are 
like an itty-bitty version of our acclaimed Mochi Rice Nuggets [sku 56990], offering the same salty, savory flavor 
and satisfyingly crunchy texture, just on a tinier scale. Why the smaller stature? Simply put, Mini Mochi Rice 
Nuggets will have relatively more surface area per handful (or mouthful), meaning even more crunch with 
every bite. And that's no small feat!

We also find that our Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets' decreased diameter makes them particularly useful as 
croutons for salads, soups, and anything else that could use a little pop of texture. We like them as a topper for 
runny eggs and stir-fried noodles, incorporated into casseroles and zucchini boats, or even ground in a food 
processor and used to bread chicken or fish. And, of course, they're always a great bar snack option, especially 
when served alongisde an ice cold beer, a glass of sake or soju, or even just a fun, fizzy soft drink.

"093184","The Dark Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Bar","We've heard people talk about ""bitter"" dark chocolate, and indeed, we've tasted our share of bitter-over-all-else 
dark chocolate. You may be tempted to assume that Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Lover's Chocolate Bar, with 
85% Cacao, would stand with the bitter faction. But we all know what happens when you assume, right?  

Okay, then. This really is a dark chocolate lover's chocolate bar. Chocolate from Colombia's Tumaco region is 
known for its fruity flavor profile, and ours doesn't disappoint. The rich, 85% cacao has a bit of sugar and natu-
ral vanilla flavor that enhances the cacao's natural flavor and takes away much of the bitterness typically associ-
ated with dark dark chocolate bars. Our supplier grows the cocoa beans, harvests the beans, roasts the beans 
and turns them into chocolate. They also make and package the individual bars for Trader Joe's. Generally, all 
of these processes are done by individual companies & craftspeople. By keeping it all in one place, we are better 
able to control both quality and cost. 

And that's why you'll pay a mere $1.69 for each 3.5-ounce package of two Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Lover's 
Chocolate Bars. People seem to think dark chocolate of this quality is supposed to cost considerably more than 
this-one taste of our bars and we promise you'll never make that assumption again.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/93184.png","1.99","[""Cheese Board"",""Desk Drawer"",""Treat Yourself""]","[""Kosher""]","[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""10 pieces (31g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""190 ""}]"

sure to win your heart. 

We commissioned a century-old, family-owned bakery in France to make these deceptively simple, classic 
French cookies. These pastry professionals begin by layering puff pastry with butter and sugar, then rolling the 
pastry ""just so,"" so that when the roll is cut, each slice resembles a charming heart. As the heart-shaped cookies 
bake, the heat of the oven caramelizes the butter and sugar, while the dough develops an impossibly crisp and 
flaky texture. And they didn't stop there. Post-baking, they glaze the cookies with even more caramel. Hearts 
be still!

These Palmiers are wonderful all on their own, served with TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576], or 
dunked in a mug of freshly brewed Organic Five Country Coffee [sku 75122]. Grab a box and share your 'hearts' 
with whomever you wish! You'll find them for a limited time in our cookie section.

Cherries, perfectly sensible treats.

These cunning confections are crafted for us using tart Montmorency Cherries grown in Royal City, Washington, 
in the heart of the Columbia River basin. The cherries are dried, then coated with a specially blended dark 
chocolate using an old-fashioned candy-coating method called ""panning."" In the end, hundreds of very thin

If something could be enrobed, dipped, or drizzled in the stuff, we've probably tried it in the pursuit of PB

presented yet another way to enjoy peanut butter: Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Flavored Baking Chips!

Creamy and nutty, sweet and salty, Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Flavored Baking Chips truly are a baker's best 
friend. While other peanut butter chips on the market rely on artificial flavors, these Baking Chips get their 
Peanut flavor from peanuts (or more specifically, peanut flour). These kosher (dairy)-certified Chips can of 
course be used for Baking (cookies, brownies, pancakes, muffins, etc.), but feel free to let the chips fall where 
they may: into a trek mix, atop a bowl of ice cream, or even right into your mouth. All that from a bag of Chips?

beautifully buttery texture. Recently, we found a supplier in the Netherlands who uses an all-butter recipe to

short (or is that a shortbread story long?), as soon as we tried it, we immediately knew how best to showcase it: 
in these jubilantly jammy All Butter Shortbread Sandwich Cookies with Raspberry Filling!

Each bite of a Trader Joe's All Butter Shortbread Sandwich Cookie is an exercise in complementary flavors 
and textures, starting with the crisp exterior of the shortbread, which quickly gives way to a magnificent, 
melt-in-your-mouth butteriness, which in turn gives way to the tart, fruity zing of the Raspberry Filling. An 
excellent option for any kind of after-dinner dessert, midday tea-time, or sweet morning indulgence situation, 
we especially enjoy pairing one of these Sandwich Cookies with a nice, hot cup of coffee or Organic Earl Grey

captivatingly crunchy. That's all. So simple. Yet they've achieved cracker excellence, made themselves 
indispensible, and carved out their own spot in the cracker hall of fame (breaking ground soon, we're sure,

Crunchy Spicy Mochi Rice Nuggets [sku 67993], we weren't sure we'd find another rice snack capable of knocking 
our customers' socks off for a third time. Dare we say, we did! Trader Joe's Sweet & Salty Umami Crunchies 
Rice Crackers are made with Japonica rice, a short grain, non-glutinous varietal. Unlike our Mochi snacks, 
made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don't break down into an entirely smooth paste. 
This difference contributes to the Cracker's unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies 
then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in 
every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news-the soy sauce in this 
snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat. Hooray!)

Snack on a handful of these Crunchies straight from the bag (more likely, two or three or four handfuls¿), or 
add some serious depth to your salads by swapping your croutons with these Crackers instead. If you really 
want to play up the Sweet & Salty thing that's going on here, we encourage you to crush them over a hot fudge

"070198","Papadums Lentil and Chickpea Crisps","For centuries, the papadum (aka papadam, or appalam) has been a staple across India, as a ubiquitous snack 
and meal accompaniment. Since the 1980s, some version of these crisp, fried, gram-flour flatbreads has been 
paired with sweet mango chutneys and mint sauce in nearly every UK curry house-not to mention other 
Indian-style restaurants all around the world. Now-since May 2022-you can pop on down to Trader Joe's for 
our version of Papadums!

Trader Joe's Papadums are perhaps smaller than the large crisps you may have seen presented in a basket 
at your local Indian restaurant. But other than being one or two-bite sized, these Papadums are made in 
a traditional fashion. Our Malaysian supplier starts with simple ingredients, making a dough derived from 
lentils and chickpeas. Formed into thin, chip-like discs, the dough is then fried in rice bran oil, and lightly 
seasoned with salt and cumin, as is common practice in parts of northern India.

The resulting airy Crisps have a lightly nutty taste and a wonderful crunch. And they're an ideal size for 
carrying your favorite Trader Joe's dip right into your open mouth. For starters, we recommend Trader Joe's 
Tamarind Sauce [sku 72128], or our Vegan Tzatziki [sku 70634]. If you're doing more than snacking, try them 
on the side with your Vegetable Biryani [sku 51530], or next to your steaming bowl of Yellow Tadka Dal [sku

this Mango packs a punch. Well, not a punch, per se, but a pleasant tartness that goes swing-for-swing with 
the sweetness.

And just how does this glorious Green Mango get its tangy twist? It's pretty simple, actually. Our Thai supplier 
picks their mangoes early, before they're ripe. The mangoes are peeled, sliced into strips, and sweetened with 
cane sugar, then dried using a unique process that uses vegetable-based glycerin to keep the Mango soft, but 
never mushy. Man-go get yourself a package today!

the holidays. And yet, we can sympathize with those who'd like to find them year 'round, every time they shop 
at Trader Joe's.

Recently, we've also begun to sympathize with those who are sensitive to gluten. They have never had the op-
portunity to enjoy Candy Cane Joe Joe's at all-even in December. For the gluten-sensitive, we've converted 
our sympathy to action. Introducing: Trader Joe's Gluten Free Candy Cane Joe Joe's. We put extra effort into 
this texture and filling. We increased the amount of cocoa in the cookie and worked diligently to get more 
candy pieces into the cream. The candy cane bits help the texture with a nice crunch, while adding an extra 
burst of peppermint flavor and sweetness. There are real candy pieces and rich cocoa in every bite. It's the 
perfect seasonal variation on this classic cookie. 

Like all of our Joe Joe's (everyday and seasonal), you'll find Gluten Free Candy Cane Joe-Joe's only at your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's. And, as previously mentioned, you'll find them only during the holiday season. 
Stock up now, stick some in the freezer, and you may be able to make them last a little longer. After that, you'll 
just have to anticipate the joy you'll feel when they return next year! Each 12-ounce box is $2.99, while they

culinary pedigree. The dough starts with wheat flour, sugar, and cultured butter, to which eggs, leavening, and a 
touch of salt are added to create the classically crumbly, shortbread cookie base. A hint of cinnamon is included 
for a subtly fragrant, but not overwhelmingly spiced flavor, and sweetened dried cranberries bring a touch of 
chewy texture and tartness to the party. That's it! 

Brilliantly buttery and not overly sweet, these Cranberry Butter Cookies are a fantastic addition to a holiday 
cookie platter or cookie exchange, and an intriguing inclusion on a cheese plate with a wedge of Creamy 
Gorgonzola Dolce [sku 77085] and a glass of Something Spritzy [sku 76687]. You'll find them on the cookie 
shelves at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, through the holiday season.

"057645","Scalloped Cracker Trio","With all the big, bold, creamy, tangy, savory, and sweet cheeses in our stores at this time of year, crackers go from 
optional accompaniment to absolute necessity. We always have a vast array of crackers from which to choose, 
and this year, just in time for the season of entertaining, we're introducing a new assortment creatively called 
Trader Joe's Scalloped Cracker Trio (bonus points if you can count the number of holiday products with the 
word ""trio"" in the title).

The Scalloped Cracker Trio is, you guessed it, an assortment of three different flavors of crackers with scalloped 
edges. Where our nomenclature might be less than inspired, the crackers themselves are downright superb. 

Flavored with garlic, rosemary, and chili, they're packed in separate sleeves within the box-the crackers stay 
fresh, the flavors don't mingle, and there's less breakage than if the crisps were loose within the package. They're 
not delicate or easily breakable, but they're not too hearty or heavy. We think their texture is ideal for holding 
cheeses, hummus, and dips like our Artichoke & Jalapeño Dip [sku 54698]. 

We're selling each 16.4 ounce box of this kosher certified Cracker Trio for $3.49, all season long.

cookie' options-like these Mini Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti.

We've offered a similar flavor profile in the past, but this just may be our best version yet. The oblong cookies 
are ""Mini"" (two to four bites), and firm, like classic biscotti. They're loaded with dried, sweetened cranberries, 
which make up 20% of the recipe. They also contain pistachios (about 10% of the recipe). This combination 
of cookie, fruit, and nuts presents a burst of complementary flavors-crunchy, chewy, sweet, tart, nutty. The 
crowning glory is a generous drizzle of confectionery icing. Eat them plain-or better yet, dunk them in your 
hot coffee for a melt-in-your-mouth-cookie experience!

We're selling each nine-ounce tub of Trader Joe's Mini Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti for $3.99*. Find them in 
our cookies section, but only for the holiday season.

origins can be tied to the Grimm's tale of Hansel & Gretel.  But don't be frightened by such a description. Sure, 
that witch had her vices, but she was just terri¿ c at decorating her candy house!  And you can do the same with 
our table-top version.

If you've always wanted to try your hand at homebuilding, here's your chance! Each kit contains the essential 
materials needed to make a substantial hexenhaus: hearty walls and roo¿ ng, outdoor decor, and durable cement. 
(¿ at is, gingerbread pieces, candies, and icing mix.) You even have three (sugary) tenants waiting to move in 
when your Gingerbread house is complete. We've also included a cookie base to make everything sturdy enough 
to last on your table through the season (if you don't eat it ¿ rst). 

Our supplier has cra¿ ed these kits for us using natural ingredients-no synthetic colors, arti¿ cial ¿ avors, or 
preservatives are used in the gingerbread or icing and candy. Eat away!

We've priced our Gingerbread House Kits at $7.99 each, a terri¿ c value.  Make one for show and one for play-
kids love toys they can eat, and since this is just a replica, there's no witch around to eat them!  Whatever you do, 
don't wait too long to buy yours.  We only order these for the holidays and when they're gone, even a fairy tale 
witch won't be able to conjure up any more until next year.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/11692.png","8.99","[""Family Style"",""Giftable"",""Merry-making""]",,"[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1/25th decorated piece (30g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""110 ""}]"

year, we're adding a companion collection of holiday confections to join this Joe-Joe's jamboree: Trader Joe's 
Astounding Multi-Flavor Mini Pretzels! Like its Joe-Joe's-centric sibling, this Mini Pretzel compilation 
contains a quadrilogy of candy-coated, bite-sized Pretzels, in a delightfully wide spectrum of sweet flavors: 
Coffee Candy, topped with a dark chocolatey drizzle; Peanut Butter Candy, topped with crumbled Joe-Joe's 
and tiny, colorful, chocolate gems; Dark Chocolate, with bits of peppermint candy; and Milk Chocolate, dotted 
with a crunchy rainbow of nonpareils.

This utterly Astounding assemblage makes a great gift for any folks on your list with a sweet tooth, presents an 
excellent option for accompanying (or even accessorizing!) desserts at a holiday feast, both, and serves as the 
ideal sweet snack for enjoying while watching your favorite holiday movie. We recommend keeping a bowl of

Knowing that many peppermint-flavored finds on the market at this time of year often fall short of expectation, 
our candy buyer worked tirelessly to ensure that Trader Joe's Peppermint Flavored Baking Chips pack the 
biggest peppermint punch of the bunch.

Made with plenty of Peppermint oil and rounded out with natural flavor, these Baking Chips also deliver on 
the candy cane visual: the velvety, snowy white chip base is made with milk powder and sweetened with cane 
sugar, and the chips are finished with an edible, bright red glitter that gets its hue from vegetable juice. Sure to 
stand out when baked into cookie dough or brownie batter, these Chips will also add plenty of peppermint flair 
when melted and drizzled atop a TJ's Chocolate Lava Cake [sku 01070]. And, they're kosher (dairy)-certified 
and gluten free, to boot! You'll find Trader Joe's Peppermint Flavored Baking Chips near our other baking

peanut butter & jelly. Even though they're such a well-known duo, we're still ¿ nding creative changes to make 
the pair especially delicious. Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Peppermint Cremes are classic creamy 
candies, with a cra¿ ily crunchy twist.

We worked with a family-owned candy company to create these crisp, cool candies. Our supplier embraces both 
the conveniences of modern methods and handmade, artisan-style candy making, which results in individual 
pieces that are ever-so-slightly distinct from one another. Each candy begins with a creamy peppermint center 
that's  then enrobed in smooth dark chocolate. ¿ is is where most chocolate peppermint cremes begin and end. 

If we'd just stopped there, our Peppermint Cremes wouldn't be much to talk about. We wanted to up the minty 
ante for the holiday season, though, so we added crushed candy canes atop each piece, bringing an extra hint of 
mint and a pleasantly unexpected crunch.

Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Peppermint Cremes come in a festively-designed, seven-ounce box for

speak, so we'll just say it for them: happy holidays! And very happy holidays it will be with Trader Joe's Scan-
dinavian Tidings decking our shelves.  

We couldn't think of a better way to embody holiday cheer than to offer a holiday-season-only version of one 
of our most popular candies. If you're familiar with our Scandinavian Swimmers [sku 55691], you'll instantly 
recognize its festive relative. These Tidings come in three joyful shapes-red ornaments, green trees, and 
clear stars. The ornaments are berry flavored, the trees sour apple flavored, and the stars are star-flavored. Just 
kidding, that wouldn't make sense. They taste like sparkling grape. We've used dyes made from spirulina and 
fruit & vegetable extracts to give the shapes their festive colors. Juicy, flavorful, sweet, perfect for snacking: 
what more could you want? While we don't encourage eating the entire bag in one sitting, we won't say we 
haven't seen it happen. We do, though, encourage grabbing at least a few bags.

"051193","Taste Test of Caramels","The pairing of chocolate and caramel has long been a favorite. A newer phenomenon, born of the artisan 
chocolate revolution and the modern American palate's openness to new and intriguing flavors, unites the 
chocolate-caramel combination with additional flavors to further enhance the palatable experience. Always 
eager to understand a new phenomenon-especially when it involves chocolate-we partnered with a trusted 
candy maker to create Trader Joe's Taste Test of Caramels, an assortment of 12 distinct flavor profiles. This 
product is sure to bring pleasure to the adventurous chocolate-caramel lover in your life.

Inside each box you'll find 12 square caramels covered in luscious chocolate. Each is hand-decorated with a 
unique design that might give you a hint about what fascinating flavors lie inside. What are the 12 flavors? 
So happy you asked. They are, in no particular order: Toffee Apple, Ginger, Vanilla, Maple, Double Espresso, 
Butterscotch, Hot Chili, Coconut, Himalayan Salted, Fig & Honey, Blood Orange Balsamic, and Strawberry 
Black Pepper. Feeling extra adventurous? Try them without matching them to the map within the box-instead,

coated with powdered sugar. Over the centuries, it has become a quintessential wintertime treat, right up there 
with gingerbread cookies and hot cocoa. It also happens to be the inspiration for our new, limited edition 
Trader Joe's Stollen Crisps.

Studded with raisins, orange & lemon peels, and complete with a dusting of snowy-white powdered sugar, 
these bespoke crackers boast the same ingredients that appear in their beloved namesake. They're constructed 
in the style of our customer-favorite Raisin Rosemary Crisps [sku 95281]-thin, crispy, and just-a-bit-bigger-
than-bite-sized-albeit a tad sweeter, making them ideal pairing partners for Dolce Creamy Gorgonzola Style 
Cheese [sku 77085] or Figgy Cheddar [sku 77098]. Want to gild the lily a bit? Use them to scoop up baked Triple 
Crème Brie [sku 55406] topped with chopped dates and fresh rosemary. Of course, they're flavorful enough to

Triangles prove that the Trader Joe's snack section is in better shape than ever. Each batch starts as a sheet 
of sumptuously buttery, multi-layered puff pastry, which our supplier tops with a classically French suite of 
aromatic Herbes de Provence, along with a bit of garlic and onion. The sheets are then cut into Triangles and 
baked until they're both crisp and airy, and every bite strikes the ideal balance of rich, savory flavor and light, 
remarkably flaky texture.

Our Herbes de Provence Triangles are equally excellent as part of an elaborate charcuterie board or cheese 
plate, as they are when enjoyed as a simple (albeit elegant) anytime snack. Try them as alternatives to pita bread 
or crackers the next time you're serving soft and creamy dips, like hummus,  Tzatziki [sku 20405], or Garlic 
Spread-Dip [sku 54173]. And when soups and salads are on the menu, these Triangles are the ideal size for

Each 3.17-ounce Coin is artfully struck from our supplier's delightfully rich and creamy milk chocolate, which 
has a soft, satisfying bite and melts most agreeably in one's mouth. Best enjoyed shared with a friend or loved 
one (a bit like real money, arguably), The Milk Chocolate Coin makes a fun, fanciful gift and a whimsical 
addition to a dessert spread centerpiece. Just be aware-it won't be in circulation for long! Be sure to pick up

put that philosophy into practice with the introduction of our now-iconic Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Kettle 
Chips [sku 55288], the first of our stuffing-centered snacks. Now, we're excited to introduce our next foray into 
the stuffing frontier: Trader Joe's Thanksgiving Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn.

A treat for any fan of fall flavors, each batch is made with light, airy, butterfly-style kernels of Popcorn, which 
are seasoned with a seasonally-appropriate blend of spices that includes celery seed, thyme, parsley, black 
pepper, and sage. In addition to making an excellent movie snack, school lunch bring-along, or simple, 
anytime indulgence, we find that this superbly savory Stuffing Seasoned Popcorn is a great addition to any

"075555","Baked Pizza Flavored Pillow Crisps","The large island of Sardinia, off the western coast of mainland Italy, is known for a variety of unique breads 
produced there-many of which have been baked and eaten by locals for hundreds of years. Tapping into this 
tradition, we at one time sold Trader Joe's Sardinian Parchment Crackers Pane Guttiau [sku 51651]. But the 
Sardinian Snack of the day happens to be Trader Joe's Baked Pizza Flavored Pillow Crisps.

These Snacks are shaped like elongated Pillows, about 1.5-inches long. They're airy-literally hollow-on the 
inside, reminiscent of ziti pasta that's been pinched closed at the ends. But instead of being hard like dried 
pasta, these Pillows are exquisitely crisp with an incredibly satisfying crunch that results from the marriage of 
coarsely milled durum wheat and our Sardinian suppliers' baking method. 

The outside is of each Crisp is seasoned with salt & natural flavors that lend a red-orange hue, with a subtly 
herby, tomato-y flavor that recalls... well... PIZZA! It's an excellent snack if you're craving something light & 
savory. Once might say that Trader Joe's Baked Pizza Flavored Pillow Crisps are nutritionally 'light,' too, with 
each 130-calorie serving being equal to 30 Crisps.

"063872","Butter Toffee Pretzels","If there's a magic formula for making a truly craveable snack, we postulate that it would have to go something 
like (sweet X salty)^(crunchy). It would follow, then, that optimal craveability would be theoretically achieved 
by optimal sweetness, optimal saltiness, and optimal crunchiness. 

Could such an optimal snack exist? Is such mathematical snack perfection possible? We have three magic words 
for you: Butter. Toffee. Pretzels. 

Combining the sweetness of delicious, sugary toffee with the saltiness of oh-so-snackable pretzels (and elevating 
them by to the power of their combined crunchiness), Trader Joe's Butter Toffee Pretzels are a snack so utterly 
craveable, so perfectly designed to make you say ""why, sure, I could go for another handful,"" that they could only 
be the product of some kind of magic ratio of salty-sweet synergy. It's only fitting, then, that throughout this 
holiday season (that most magic time of year), we're selling 10-ounce bags of Butter Toffee Pretzels for $2.99.

almonds or chocolate are added. Our new Toffee Trio brings even more to the party: a variety of chocolatey 
flavors, plus the nostalgia of cinnamon-sugar.

We commissioned some toffee experts to construct these candies-the same experts who make Trader Joe's 
English Toffee with Nuts [skus 92815 & 68828]. (Fun fact: ""English"" is a style of toffee, not an indication of where 
the toffee is made.) They begin with bite-sized pieces of English toffee (including crushed almonds), which are 
then covered in one of three chocolatey options: dark, milk, or white chocolate. Each piece is then sprinkled all 
over with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. The result is a treat that hints at autumn the moment it's lifted to 
your mouth. Beyond that sugary cinnamon, one will also experience the smooth taste of chocolate, leading up 
to a tried-and-true toffee crunch with all of the anticipated buttery richness.

Toffee lovers will find plenty to love in our Cinnamon Sugar Toffee, and if you're among those who've yet to 
experience the delights that toffee can bring, this is your chance to discover true toffee joy!

"076294","Garlic & Black Pepper Almonds","Ah, the almighty almond. While technically not a nut in a strictly scientific sense (botanically, it's actually 
considered  a drupe, in the same family as plums and cherries), it's undoubtedly earned its multitude of spaces 
upon the shelves of our nut section. Our newest almond-powered addition to said section, Trader Joe's Garlic 
& Black Pepper Almonds, deftly demonstrates why: by adding just a simple suite of savory seasonings (black 
pepper, sea salt, and dehydrated garlic and onion), these crunchy, well-roasted Almonds take on a whole new 
dimension of flavor, offering alluring, allium aromatics and a subtle, yet satisfying, level of spice.

An ideal addition to any cheese plate, charcuterie board, or cocktail party snack table, Trader Joe's Garlic 
& Black Pepper Almonds also make a superb snack for simply enjoying by the handful, anytime you might 
feel peckish. Enjoy them as a movie snack, a treat for the whole table at a board game night, or as a crunchy 
companion to an ice-cold beer. We find their simple, savory profile and delectably crunchy texture also make 
them a great choice for including in custom snack mixes: try combining them your other favorite seasoned 
nuts (botanically accurate or not), or, for a real curveball, with our Oven-Baked Cheese Bites [sku 57243].

"074622","Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars","According to historians, trick-or-treating traces its origins to a 16th-century custom in Scotland and Ireland 
known as ""guising."" Back then, children (and a few adults) would don costumes and go to door-to-door asking 
for fruit, baked goods, or money in exchange for reciting poetry (an aspect we are, arguably, spared from in the 
modern era). While it wasn't until the early 20th century that the practice and the phrase ""trick or treat"" were 
popularized in North America, it's clear that the desire to give and get candy on a chilly autumn night has been 
with us for a long, long time. Which is precisely why we're proud to finally get in on the game with Trader Joe's 
Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars!

Each bag contains 24 Mini-sized milk Chocolate Bars in four different varieties of fillings: sweet and fluffy 
Nougat, gooey and chewy Nougat & Caramel; satisfyingly crunchy Peanut & Caramel, and delightfully crisp 
Caramel & Wafer. They're individually wrapped, so they're easy to hand out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween, 
or take a few with you wherever you need to go. They make a Wicked Good movie snack, a perfectly portioned 
school lunch dessert, and a fun, festive inclusion to a communal candy bowl at home or the office. Just be sure 
to pick up a bag while supplies last, because they're only around for a limited time!

"063878","Halloween Gummies","Halloween is just around the corner, and that means you'll soon be faced with the dilemma of what to give your 
neighborhood goblins and ghouls. In years past, we've suggested some pretty outlandish options-products 
that straddle the line between ""trick"" and ""treat,"" shall we say. (Think: Frozen Three Cheese Pizzas, Veggie 
Patties, Fennel Toothpaste¿you get the picture.) If you're looking for a bonafide treat treat, we suggest Trader 
Joe's Halloween Gummies.

Made for us by a much-favored gummy producer in France, who's supplied many of our classic gummy 
products of the past, Trader Joe's Halloween Gummies are fruity, fresh-no stale, hard gummies here, folks-
and fun. Each .7-ounce pouch contains an assortment of five spooky shapes, made without gelatin and colored 
with only naturally available products-like black carrot extract and apple, carrot, pumpkin, & blackcurrant 
concentrates. Toss one in the your neighborhood Jedi-or-ninja-for-a-night's candy collection. Pack one in your 
purse for snacking-on-the-go. Sneak one into your significant other's lunch bag. You know what they say-
Gummies are a sign of great affection.

"075752","Organic Seedy Crackers","Having taste-tested quite a few crackers in our time, we can tell you that the most crucial aspect of a cracker 
is usually how satisfying its crunch is. For example, while our Trader Joe's Organic Seedy Crackers are 
tremendously savory and delightfully hearty, what really sets them apart is their remarkably resonant crunch. 
What's our supplier's secret? Making each Cracker primarily from the kinds of crispy seeds and grains that 
tend to play a supporting role in other crackers. Starting with a base of organic brown rice, our supplier mixes 
in organic quinoa, flax, and sesame seeds into each batch, then flavors them with a bit of umami-forward 
tamari before baking, resulting in one captivatingly crunchy (and gloriously gluten-free!) Cracker.

Excellent as an anytime snack, and an ideal inclusion in school lunches, our vegan and kosher (pareve) Organic 
Seedy Crackers especially excel when used as a vehicle for cheeses, charcuterie, or dips. We find that their 
superlatively crisp texture and light umami edge make them particularly suited for pairing with rich, creamy 
fare. Try them with a bit of Ricotta [sku 50920] and Olive Tapenade [sku 62480], a slice of avocado and Lightly 
Smoked Salmon in Olive Oil [sku 72633], or, to keep things vegan, a simple spread of Dairy-Free Garlic & Herbs 
Boursin [sku 73166].

There's just something about its deep, rich sweetness that gives us that all-round autumn-y feeling. And what 
better way could there be to celebrate this maple-induced nuttiness than with Trader Joe's Maple Spiced Nut 
Mix? Available only during the fall season, this magnificent mélange includes almonds and pecans that have 
both been coated in a buttery maple rosemary glaze, along with crisp pepitas for some complementary crunch, 
and sweetened dried cranberries to provide an element of tartness to tie everything together.

Sweet, crunchy, and with just a touch of heat and rosemary-tinged herbaceous notes, every bite of our Maple 
Spiced Nut Mix evokes the essence of autumn. Enjoy a handful while watching a spooky (or not-so-spooky!) 
movie,  sipping an appropriately autumnal cocktail, or simply enjoying a brisk, blustery, weekend afternoon. If 
you've got a gathering on the horizon, we also find that they're excellent as part of a pre-dinner party spread,

"057367","Petite Pumpkin Spice Cookies","Trader Joe's Petite Pumpkin Spice Cookies are super delicious shortbread cookies that just happen to be cute 
as a pumpkin. In fact, they're shaped like pumpkins, so that comparison is appropriate. We'll even go out on a 
limb and say they're probably even cuter than most pumpkins you'd meet.

The cookies are crafted of a pumpkin-spiced shortbread dough; crunchy and crispy and crumbly and incredibly 
delightful to eat. Petite Pumpkin Spice Cookies are coated with either white or orange icing. The white icing has 
a tangy, yogurt base, and the orange icing furthers the foray into pumpkin spice territory. The white pumpkins 
are dotted with orange nonpareils (sprinkles), while the orange pumpkins are studded with white nonpareils. 
Cute, captivating, crunchy, crumbly, creamy (frosting)... Fret not if you follow a particular diet, because four 
Cookies have only 50mg of sodium and 0mg cholesterol, and they're kosher. 

These are great by the fire with a nice cup of Pumpkin Spice Tea [sku 97299], or on a plate of holiday treats with 
Mini Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse Cakes [sku 55381] and sliced Organic Fuji Apples [sku 90192].

Trader Joe's Petite Pumpkin Spice Cookies are a must-try for Pumpkin Season 2016. We're selling each 10

"053421","Pumpkin Joe-Joe's Cookies","Perhaps you thought that Halloween Joe Joe's [sku 96347] had this season covered. But deep down, you had to 
know that we'd do it eventually. It really was just a matter of time. And the time is now. Trader Joe's Pumpkin 
Joe-Joe's Cookies are the Pumpkin Season variation on the theme that is Joe Joe's Sandwich Cookies. 

There's nothing complicated about Pumpkin Joe-Joe's. They're simple vanilla wafer cookies sandwiched 
together with pumpkin crème filling. That filling is delightfully pumpkin-y, sweet but not too sweet, and oh-so 
creamy. While we may sound casual about this combination, achieving the Pumpkin Joe-Joe was a tough task, 
albeit also a tasty one. In fact, we tested 17 different versions to find the ideal tension between cookie and fill-
ing and the perfect harmony of pumpkin, vanilla and warm spice flavor. Totally worth it.

Like all of the cookies in this family, the Pumpkin Joe-Joe's are twistable, dunkable, crunchable, crumbleable, 
and eminently enjoyable. Unlike most of the others, these are only available for a very short period of time. If 
Joe Joe's are your thing, and pumpkin is your passion, run-don't walk-to your neighborhood Trader Joe's to 
grab yourself a box (or five) before they disappear.

We're selling each 10.5 ounce box of Pumpkin Joe Joe's for $2.99. You'll find them only at Trader Joe's.

"076611","Maple Flavored Fudge","It's safe to say that one of England's most famed candy exports is butter fudge. So when our product developer 
was foraging for a newfangled addition to our fall candy offerings, they combined the exquisite simplicity of 
this buttery British confection with a tried & true favorite of the fall flavor scene here in the States, and came 
up with Trader Joe's Maple Flavored Fudge.

Fashioned exclusively for us by experts across the pond, this is a first-rate Fudge with a decidedly nontraditional 
twist. Salted butter, sweetened condensed milk, and sugar form the classic butter fudge base, while the addition 
of Maple syrup lends a fall-focused flavor. The ingredients are combined and cooked in traditional copper 
pans, then cooled for two days before being cut and packed. This meticulous process yields sweet, rich, Maple-y 
Fudge, with a delightfully crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth texture that's enjoyable on its own, or alongside a 
piping hot mug of Harvest Blend Herbal Tea [sku 51424]. You might also crumble it atop a bowl of Salted Maple 
Ice Cream [sku 74637] or a stack of waffles and bacon to further highlight its pleasant sweet & salty notes. We're 
offering Trader Joe's Maple Flavored Fudge on our candy shelves, until we run out.

Ornaments [sku 71814], but these Melts have a distinctive fall flair. Each package contains four, pumpkin-
shaped confections, made of a Mexican Style white chocolate, with a hint of spicy cinnamon. They're gourd-
ously decorated and naturally colored with paprika oleoresin, spirulina extract, and fruit juice. 

To a mug of warm milk or the non-dairy beverage of your choice, place a pumpkin on top, and watch as it 
slowly melts away to reveal a secret stash of marshmallows and milk chocolate drops. Give it a good stir and 
you have yourself a magnificent cup of Hot Cocoa. 

Our Hot Cocoa Melts are beautifully packaged and extremely giftable. If you keep a box for yourself, serve

"074888","Chai Tea Mints","One sunny summer afternoon, as our Buyer was checking out at her neighborhood Trader Joe's, she was struck

Infused Mints [sku 96004] are our best-selling breath mints, why not try translating another Tea into Mint 
form? And thus, Trader Joe's Chai Tea Mints were born. 

Much like the real McCoy, Trader Joe's Chai Tea Mints are made with black tea and crushed cardamom 
seeds, plus cinnamon, clove, and ginger natural flavors. We've also added a bit of peppermint oil for a cooling, 
freshening effect, because, you know... breath mints. Like their Green Tea counterparts, they're shaped like tiny

about a classic recipe, crafted to our stringent cookie standards (among them, delightfulness, deliciousness, 
and of course, dunkability) that's, quite frankly, irresistible. Case (or cookie, rather) in point: our new and 
improved Trader Joe's Joe-Joe's Chocolate Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies.

When this Cookie's predecessor fell out of favor with customers, we partnered with a long-time supplier to 
create a next-generation Joe-Joe worthy of the name. It starts simply enough with two delightfully crunchy, 
chocolate cookies, made with rich cocoa powder and a touch of sea salt. Sandwiched between them is a sweet, 
whipped creme filling, flecked with fragrant, flavorful specks of vanilla bean throughout. It's a timeless-
and undeniably delicious-combination of toothsome cookies and velvety creme, ideal for dunking in milk, 
snacking out of hand, packing in a lunch bag, crumbling into the base of an ice cream cake¿ you get the idea! 

In addition to the glow-up of the Cookies themselves, we've taken this opportunity to remove the outer box 
from the equation, opting instead for a resealable film that protects the cookies in their tray while simultaneously 
maximizing freshness-no cookie jar required! Whether you're a fan of the original or an inquisitive initiate, 
Joe-Joe's Chocolate Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies are sure to become an instant classic in your pantry.

"075556","Pretzel Breadsticks","One might say that it's impossible to improve upon the sublime simplicity of a crisp, cracker-y breadstick. Well, 
to that, we say: that's not never stopped us from trying before! Made for us by a supplier in Italy, Trader Joe's 
Pretzel Breadsticks takes the basic form of a breadstick (the kind you might find as an appetizer at a cloth 
napkin Italian restaurant, rather than the softer kind you might get at a pizzeria) and properly pretzel-izes it. 
Each stick starts as a bit of rustic, sourdough-esque dough, which is rolled into a twisty, approximately eight-
inch-long baton, then baked to a perfect golden brown before being studded with cruncht crystals of sea salt.

Much like their combined, namesake inspirations, Trader Joe's Pretzel Breadsticks make a fantastic  appetizer 
or anytime snack, all on their own. Where we think they really excel, however, is in their use as a dipping and 
dunking snack. We recommend trying them in everything from spicy mustards and tart, tangy aiolis (like our  
very own Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce [sku 27677]) to bubbly fondues and savory-seasoned dips of all kinds, 
like our Crunchy Chili Onion Hummus [sku 76277], Creamy Spinach & Artichoke Dip [sku 78032], or Pimento

"073917","Freeze Dried Fig Slices","Freeze dried fruit is a little miracle of modern food technology. Freshly-harvested fruit is washed and dried, 
then placed into a very cold vacuum chamber, where the water is removed without damaging the cells of the 
fruit. The result is dry and crisp, with concentrated fruit flavors - our ever-popular Freeze Dried Strawberries 
[sku 80665] are excellent examples of the texture and flavor of freeze dried fruit.

The newest miracle to arrive on our freeze dried fruit shelves are Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Fig Slices. These 
fabulous Figs come to us directly from a supplier in Turkey, the world's leading fig-producing country. They 
use the Smyrna variety of fig, known for its seedy, pink flesh and pale green skin. (Fun fact: when this fig variety 
was initially transported to California for production, its name was changed: Calimyrna figs are the same as 
Smyrna figs, but grown in California rather than Turkey.) Here, that pink, seedy interior takes on a crispy 
texture, and delivers the expected figgy flavors with aplomb. These are great for snacking anytime, excellent in 
a bowl of cereal, and will liven up a cheese & charcuterie board on both the flavor and texture fronts. You'll find 
them in our dried fruit and nuts section.

[sku 94329], Organic Dried Mango [sku 51753], Soft & Juicy Mango [sku 98941], and Chile Spiced Mango [sku

Haden (red/yellow skin), Keitt (green skin), and Ataulfo (golden yellow). But Trader Joe's Organic Dried 
Atualfo Mango Slices is made exclusively from Ataulfo mangoes. Here's why this is exciting...

Ataulfo mangoes, sometimes called ""honey mangoes"" or ""champagne mangoes,"" are indeed a special breed. 
Underneath their golden-yellow skin, these oblong-shaped mangoes have a much-less-fibrous flesh (compared 
with those other varieties), along with a very smooth, buttery texture. The fruit is naturally sweet and juicy.

Our supplier in Mexico (the land where Ataulfos originate) takes advantage of these traits by peeling, pitting, 
and thinly slicing fully ripe Ataulfos, then expertly drying them. That's it! Nothing else is added to these 
Organic Mango Slices, so you get to enjoy pure, authentic Dried Ataulfo Mango, with its pleasantly chewy 
texture, and honey-sweet flavor. And like our other dried mango offerings, these make a delicious anytime 
snack that can even satisfy your candy cravings. They're also really tasty paired with something salty and 
crunchy, such as Trader Joe's Pretzel Sticks [sku 12564].

year. We sell raw pecans and roasted pecans, whole pecans, and pieces of pecans. And, these, the pecans de 
resistance, Sweet & Spicy Pecans.

Trader Joe's Sweet & Spicy Pecans begin as high quality, fancy junior mammoth (that's how they're officially

canola oil, and seasoned with sugar, salt, and a kicky blend of spices - cayenne, ancho chile, and paprika - 
to create a uniquely flavored nut that's at home as a snack, salad topper, or cheese plate partner. They're not 
too sweet and not too spicy; their balance is what makes them so craveable. Our recommendation: Buy two

you'll find an abundance of eminently snackable Sticks, each one possessing a soft, silky, delightfully chewy, 
Pineapple-flavored center, coated in a rich, sturdy, delicious Dark Chocolate shell. Yum. Firm enough to hold 
its shape, yet soft enough to melt beautifully in your mouth, and bursting with lush, tropical flavor, we have no 
doubt you'll be reaching back into the bag for Stick after Stick after Stick¿ Unlike their citrusy cousins, we 
only sell Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Pineapple Sticks during the summer, so be sure to pick up a package 
or two while you can.

"055294","Ghost Pepper Potato Chips","For a few years (2007-2012) the Ghost chili was classified as the world's hottest chili pepper, with an average of 
more than 1,000,000 Scoville heat units-that's about 417 times hotter than the average jalapeño! And while it 
has been knocked to third place (Carolina Reaper and Trinidad Moruga Scorpion in first and second, respec-
tively), it still packs a ghostly punch. 

When something this spicy comes along, our first instinct is almost always how to eat it without injuring our-
selves or others. And so we created Trader Joe's Ghost Chili Lattice Cut Potato Chips, of course.

Ghost Pepper Potato Chips are seriously spicy chips, but if you're a lover of all things spicy, these will bring pure 
joy and bliss rather than pain and suffering. Their spiciness is also balanced by the naturally sweet profile of the 
potatoes themselves-the chili enhances, rather than overwhelms the potato. Crafted exclusively for Trader 
Joe's, these are lattice cut chips, so they really hold to their spicy seasoning. 

Hauntingly crispy, these treats evoke the spookiness of Halloween. In that spirit, by the time the goblins have 
disappeared from your neighborhoods, Ghost Pepper Lattice Cut Chips will have disappeared from your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's. Don't let the specter of missing them cause you to cry ""Boo!"" Come in for yours 
soon, before they're mere phantoms of what used to be. Each seven-ounce bag is $2.29, while they last.

"075529","Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs","In the spring of 2022, we introduced a three-pack of vegan Oat Chocolate Bars [sku 71552]. A dairy-defying 
feat of deliciousness, the oat-based Chocolate is impossibly smooth and creamy, just like milk chocolate-but 
without milk! Building upon that bodacious base, our buyer worked with the same bean-to-bar supplier in 
Colombia to develop a crispy counterpart, in the form of Trader Joe's Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice 
& Cocoa Nibs.

Made with cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 42% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in 
milk chocolate), the addition of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat ""milk"") makes these Bars lusciously-
dare we say, ludicrously-creamy. Bite into one of these Bars, however, and you'll experience a terrific textural 
transition from magnificently smooth, ""I-can't-believe-it's-not-milk"" chocolate to the delightful crunch of the 
included Crispy Rice and Cocoa Nibs, along with a touch of sea salt. Like their forebears, these Bars are vegan, 
soy free, gluten free, and kosher (pareve). They're also presented as a three-pack of individually wrapped bars 
for easy, on-the-go enjoyment. In short, they're some of the best non-dairy chocolate bars we've tasted, bar 
none!

"074071","Trio of Soft Licorice Twists","Licorice has long been a favorite among the candy-eating crowd in Australia and New Zealand , going all the way 
back to the Victorian Era. It wasn't until the 1950's, however, that soft and chewy licorice rose to prominence 
across Australasia. According to legend, one candy company accidentally created a batch far softer than they 
meant to, and gave it away to local children for free. It proved to be a tremendous hit, and more than 70 years 
later, it remains one of the most popular styles of licorice globally. Trader Joe's Trio of Soft Licorice Twists is 
of this superbly soft and pleasantly chewy variety, and also contain the additional twist (see what we did there?) 
of coming in three phenomenally fruity flavors: ripe raspberry, tropical mango, and tart green apple.

Ideal for any situation that calls for sweet snacking, Trader Joe's Trio of Soft Licorice Twists can be enjoyed 
as a movie candy, a school lunch dessert, or, our personal favorite, as an anytime, ""just-because"" treat. We find 
that its complementary mix of flavors strikes a nice balance of consistency and variety: just enough of each to 
keep every bite interesting. And if you've got a road trip, ball game, or amusement park outing on your horizon, 
a Trio of Soft Licorice Twists makes a capital companion.

"075064","Passion Fruit Rounds","As a matter of principle, we are proudly, pronouncedly, and profoundly passionate about passion fruit in all its 
forms. Recently, one of our buyers found a form of passion fruit that took us by surprise: dried passion fruit. 
Never before had we tried something that so captured the experience of enjoying a jubilantly juicy passion 
fruit, while remaining rather un-juicy-and, we might add, un-messy. We knew right away that it  was destined 
for our shelves, in the form of Trader Joe's Passion Fruit Rounds.

Our supplier in Vietnam-an expert in all things dried fruit-makes each bag of our Passion Fruit Rounds by 
taking passion fruit seeds, along with the sweet, tart, and delighftully tropical pulp that surrounds them, and 
combines them with a bit of apple juice and sugar to provide some extra body. They then pour the whole mixture 
into disc-shaped molds, and dehydrate the whole mix it until it reaches a  charmingly chewy texture. Together, 
the combo of sweet and sour, chewy and crunchy (courtesy of the generously-studded seeds throughout) create 
a harmonious balance that's as unique as the passion fruit itself is. We recommend enjoying them as a quick, 
fruity snack, as a sweet treat to munch while watching a movie, or as a fun bit of cocktail decor, affixed to the 
rim of something sweet and tangy.

"074064","PB&C Snack Duo","Under most circumstances, a crispy, crunchy, cocoa crème-filled wafer cookie would be reason enough to get 
excited, come snacktime. That's where Trader Joe's PB & C Snack Duo really stands out. Each box comes with 
six individual packs, which each contain with the aforementioned cocoa crème-y wafer sticks, plus a sidecar 
of soft, creamy, and lightly salted peanut butter dip to dip them into. Together, they create a simultaneously 
sweet and savory snack that's nearly as fun to dunk as they are to eat-a snacktivity, if you will, for both kids 
and kids at heart.

Made for us by the same supplier as our celebrated PB & J Snack Duo [sku 64117], our PB & C Snack Duo 
changes one iconic flavor combo for another, to equally delicious results. Together, the rich flavors of the cocoa 
crème and peanut butter dip synergize with the superlatively crispy texture of the wafer stick and oh-so silky 
consistency of the dip to create a consummately complementary sweet treat. While they're an ideal option for 
school lunches and weekend snacktimes, we'll certainly admit to stashing a few in our desk as an emergency

"074539","Snacky Clusters","Even seasoned snackers can be stumped by the age-old conundrum: salty or sweet? Some solve it by eating 
something salty, followed by something sweet... often followed again by something salty, etc. At Trader Joe's, we 
know this conundrum well, and we propose Snacky Clusters as another solution to the salty-sweet snacking 
cycle.

You shouldn't get caught in circular snacking with Trader Joe's Snacky Clusters because each piece includes 
both salty and sweet elements. We've taken Sea Salt Potato Chips, Corn Chip Dippers, and Mini Pretzel Nuggets, 
and crushed them, then we've mixed everything with creamy milk chocolate and divided the resulting 
combination into bite-sized Clusters. The upshot of this innovation is that each bite begins with smooth, sweet 
chocolate, and is quickly followed by the salted crunch of Chips and Nuggets. Snacking conundrum solved!

Of course, it's possible that we may have inadvertently created a new snacking cycle that goes like: Trader Joe's 
Snacky Cluster, followed by another Trader Joe's Snacky Cluster... often followed again by a Trader Joe's 
Snacky Cluster, etc.

"050236","Speculoos Cookies","A traditional European cookie commonly served in bistros, cafés, and on airplanes, speculoos cookies first 
made their debut on Trader Joe's shelves in 2011-not in cookie form, but blended into Trader Joe's Speculoos 
Cookie Butter Spread [sku 96761]. Never ones to scoff at tradition-or a good cookie, for that matter-it only 
made sense to bring in the cookie behind the craze, and we've been selling Trader Joe's Speculoos Cookies to 
the delight of cookie fans (and Cookie Butter fans) ever since.

Made for us in Belgium, the crisp composition of our Speculoos Cookies is surprisingly simple. The base is 
composed of wheat flour, baking soda, palm oil, and canola oil, producing a delightfully snappy texture, while 
the sugar and sugar syrup in the recipe caramelize as the Cookies are baked to a golden-brown hue, creating a 
craveable, honey-like sweetness that's rounded out with a dash of warm cinnamon and a touch of sea salt. Their 
thin, oblong shape makes these vegan Cookies a capital accompaniment to a hot cup of coffee or tea or an ice-
cold glass of milk. Pop a few into a lunchbox for a midday treat, or crush and sprinkle atop ice cream-or better 
yet, crumble and use as the crust for an ice cream cake!

& Sea Salt, on the other hand, is all bark and just begging for a bite!

The Bark you'll find within each bag starts as a thin(ish) slab of rich Dark Chocolate, studded with crunchy 
roasted Almond & Pretzel pieces. Our supplier then sprinkles said slab with Sea Salt, breaks it into snackable 
pieces, and packages it up for your enjoyment. The end result? A sweet, chocolatey treat that's well worth every 
bite. Heck, it's so good, you might even want to bark about it.

"074887","Milk Chocolate Bar with Corn Flakes","Chocolate bars with crunch usually include puffed rice-it's great for adding that specific, airy crispness. But 
if you want a more serious crunch? Then you must include Corn Flakes. And that means our new Milk 
Chocolate Bar with Corn Flakes is serious business.

It's made for us by the same Belgian supplier that makes our Pound Plus Chocolate Bars, so you know it's a 
quality Bar. The 31% cacao Milk Chocolate is decidedly rich and creamy, yet not cloyingly sweet. Adding Corn 
Flakes amplifies everything, imbuing the bar not just with crunch, but with a hint of saltiness, too.

Right about now, you might be thinking, ""I know what I'm having for breakfast!""  And we wouldn't blame you. 
But, for those who like to be a little more discerning, we've scored the entire Bar in different sized portions-so 
you can break off a little or a lot, depending on the time of day and your internal chocolate clock.

closer to the real thing. So, taking inspiration from all that's good about s'mores (which is, really, everything 
about s'mores), we dreamed up a compact, bite-sized treat that requires no assembly. Enter, for your delight, 
Trader Joe's S'mores Clusters.

Crispy graham cracker pieces form the base, which is mixed with mini marshmallows. The smaller bits make 
for a more randomly shaped morsel, once it's coated in the smooth milk chocolate. We daresay these jagged 
Clusters provide more textural excitement, and are more akin to the melted mass you pull fresh from the 
campfire! Speaking of heat, while not required, you can microwave these treats for about five seconds, creating 
an eating experience that will transport you right to the campsite.

Of course, an inspired improvement also comes with a more inspired package. These Clusters come in a

"016126","Old Fashioned Blister Peanuts","Back in the old days, people used to soak raw peanuts in water to remove those thin, red skins before they 
roasted them. The residual moisture would interact with the oil during roasting and cause little bubbles or 
""blisters"" to form on the outside of the nuts. Instead of being unwelcome, these serendipitous blisters added 
texture-ultimately creating a unique peanut snack.

Trader Joe's Old Fashioned Blister Peanuts harken back to these original ""blistereds,"" as they were once 
called. While water is no longer required to remove peanut skins (there are new technologies for that) our 
supplier still blanches extra large Virginia peanuts in hot water before roasting them in peanut oil and adding 
salt. The finished nuts are crisp, bubbly, and extra crunchy-a super swell snack if we ever did see one!

superbly savory dish comprised of thin, crispy-fried rice noodles tossed in a rich, aromatic, sweet and sour 
sauce. Sometimes an entrée, sometimes an appetizer, and always a treat, some of our Buyers recently had the 
opportunity to try mee krob in Thailand for themselves. After taking in its complex flavors and chewy, crispy 
textures, inspiration struck, and they immediately began working with one of our Thai suppliers to create 
Trader Joe's Mee Krob Snackers.

To make each batch of these shelf stable, vegan, gluten free mee krob morsels, our supplier starts much in the 
same way you would make mee krob in a restaurant setting: they deep fry rice noodles until they're superlatively 
crispy, then add bits of fried garlic, fried shallot, and cashews for even more crunch. After that, they layer in a 
super flavorful sauce made with tamarind paste, vinegar, chili sauce, lime juice, and sugar. Once the noodles 
have soaked up the sauce and cooled down, they're cut into one-or-two-bite squares, and voila: Snackers! 
Aside from being an excellent anytime snack, we're particularly fond of them as an accompaniment for a spicy, 
curry-seasoned soup, a base for fancy seafood hors d'oeuvres, or as crouton for a sweet, citrus-y salad.

"055085","Sweet Plantain Chips","The Quindío region of Colombia is part of the so-called ""coffee triangle"" (Triángulo del Café), widely considered 
one of the best places to grow coffee beans. It is less widely considered one of the best places to grow plantains¿ 
but this doesn't make that fact any less true! The volcanic soil, altitude, proximity to the equatorial line, and 
consistent climate make this region an exceptional environment for growing this banana cultivar.

Trader Joe's Sweet Plantain Chips start with plantains grown in this very region. Bunches are harvested by 
hand to reduce bruising. After harvest, the plantains are allowed extra time to ripen to a sweetness of 24 brix 
(natural sugar content level), as opposed to only 12 brix-a more typical number for other plantain growers. 
The profoundly sweet, ripe plantains are also exceedingly soft at this point-almost too soft to cut. Our 
Colombian supplier carefully peels each plantain by hand, and hand-feeds each one into a cutting machine to 
further protect the fruit. The sweet plantain slices then take a quick dip in hot sunflower oil, just until perfectly 
crisp. When your hand reaches into the bag, you'll pull out a handful of crunchy, gluten free ""chips"" with a 
sweetness all their own (absolutely no sugar is added). While they're a superb standalone snack, they also 
synergize spectacularly with all kinds of dips, but especially ones that have a bit of sweet and savory to them, 
like our Pineapple Salsa [sku 06602].

Our supplier scours the stalk market for the finest organic, stoneground blue corn that money can buy, then 
adds a bit of water to it to make masa (dough). Once the masa is rolled flat and machine-cut into uniform 
triangles, the chips take not one, not two, but three passes through an open-flame conveyer oven. After a quick 
dip in the fryer and a few rolls through a giant salt tumbler, these chips are crisped & ready for whatever fixins

simultaneously true. But still, it's not uncommon for us to get the question, ""How can mango be simultaneously

It's a good question, and one that deserves an answer. So we'll give it a go. This is Chokanan mango, grown 
in Thailand, where it is harvested at the peak of ripeness, then peeled and sliced into strips (it's the same type 
of mango you'll find in our Chile Spiced Mango [sku 81702]). The drying process is unique in that it uses 
vegetable-based glycerin to keep the mango soft - but never mushy - and mango juice is added in to give it a 
little extra moisture and further intensify the mango flavor.  

If you like the taste of mango, but find peeling a fresh mango a hassle, or you're not a fan of the typically tougher 
texture of traditional dried mango, Trader Joe's Soft & Juicy Mango is right on the money for you. We're selling 
it in six ounce bags for $1.99, not very much money for such a satisfyingly sweet treat. You'll find this Soft &

"040978","Chocolatey Coated Chocolate Chip Cookie Dunkers","Having a wonderfully warm cup of coffee or hot chocolate is a treat in its own, we 100% agree. But for some 
reason, we couldn't just leave it at that; we had to find a best buddy for your lonely beverage. And on that day, 
Trader Joe's Chocolatey Coated Chocolate Chip Dunkers were born and we will never look back. 

Devised with double the chocolate for milk-dunking fun in mind- might we suggest to try with chocolate milk 
for an extremely chocolatey treat! A flawlessly engineered oblong shape designed to dunk with ease. Crispy, 
crunchy, and firm so they maintain structural integrity even after being submerged in your dipping drink of 
choice. Trader Joe's Chocolatey Coated Chocolate Chip Dunkers are truly the ideal snack when a glass 
of milk or mug of coffee alone won't cut it. A tub of these will work wonders whether appropriately stored by 
your packs of hot cocoa mix at home in the pantry or in the breakroom at work beside that fancy new coffee 
machine that you can't quite work yet!

"075059","Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almonds","We're more than slightly excited to introduce Trader Joe's Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almonds. Much 
more! But since good candy is so often characterized by excess, you may wonder why we would choose 
moderation when creating this nutty, chocolatey treat. The answer is... you. More and more customers have 
been asking for less and less-when it comes to sugar content, and other nutritional aspects considered by some 
to be less than desirable. And so, we decided to create some Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds with notably 
less of the less desirable stuff-while still providing a really significant snacking experience. To a substantial 
degree, we believe we've succeeded!

Our supplier dry-roasts California Almonds, then pans them (tumbles them in a barrel with chocolate), and 
finishes them with a dusting of cocoa powder and sea salt. The chocolate-to-nut ratio ends up being about 
20/80. (Typically, chocolate covered nuts are around 66/33.) Nutritionally, this means that each 150-calorie 
serving (28g) contains just 4g of sugar. Compare these with our Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate Covered 
Almonds [sku 56016], which have 11g sugar per serving (30g).

Experientially, this means each Slightly Coated Dark Chocolate Almond that you pop in your mouth has a 
delightful crunch, with enough salty sweetness to more-than-slightly satisfy your snack cravings!

"065583","Organic Garlic Naan Crackers","Trader Joe's Organic Naan Garlic Crackers are like bite-sized versions of the Garlic Naan Bread [sku 77678]
you find in our freezers. Each wheat Cracker is seasoned with garlic, parsley, and sea salt and even comes 
complete with those bubbles and char marks that appear on naan bread. The difference is, these are organic, 
crispy (they are crackers after all!), and the ideal size for scooping everything from hummus to our Creamy 
Cauliflower Jalapeño Dip [sku 67700].

With their warm and savory profile, our Organic Garlic Naan Crackers are the perfect partners for your bowl 
of soup. Try them topped with creamy French Brie, or crumbled over your salad for added garlicky crunch. Of 
course, you can always pair them with any of our Indian Fare entrees.

from your very own oven. It's a profound experience, diving into all that soft, sweet, spiraling dough, aromatic 
cinnamon spice, and luxuriously creamy frosting-inspirational, even. In fact, the iconic cinnamon bun has 
now played muse for a number of recently introduced snacks and sweet treats at Trader Joe's, including our 
brand new Trader Joe's Cinnamon Bun Inspired Joe-Joe's. 

Made with the same classic sandwich crème cookie construction as our classic Joe-Joe's, this newest addition to 
the Joe-Joe's lineup swaps out the chocolate cookies for a pair made with wheat flour and graham flour (i.e., the 
stuff that's used to make graham crackers) that have been dusted with sweet cinnamon sugar. Combined with 
the vanilla crème filling inside, every bite evokes the familiar flavors of a warm, perfectly frosted cinnamon 
bun. They make a great mini-dessert for school lunches, a fun treat when dunked in milk (or your favorite 
non-dairy alternative), and of course, an excellent anytime indulgence, whenever you need something sweet 
and cinnamon-y.

"051753","Organic Dried Mango Unsulfured & Unsweetened","The first mangoes that Americans ever tasted were pickled. Had the fruit not been preserved in that briny liquid, 
it would not have survived the voyage from the East Indian tropics to the northeastern coast of the colonial 
United States. Of course, had Trader Joe's been in Boston in the late 17th century, colonists most certainly 
would have ignored the vinegary version in favor of our sweet (yet, unsweetened) Organic Dried Mangoes.

Our Dried Mangoes are made from several different mango varieties-Kent, Haden, Ataulfo, and Keitt-grown 
in the Mexico. The fresh fruit is delivered to the nearest of a number of Mexican plants where it is simply washed, 
peeled, and sliced by hand, before being carefully placed on multi-layered racks for drying. Once dehydrated, 
the mangoes are hand-sorted (to remove the less than perfect pieces) and packed into the attractive, see-through 
bags you find on the shelf at your neighborhood Joe's.

We call them ""unsweetened"" because we've added no sugar to these naturally sweet mangoes. They're ""unsulfured"" 
because their lovely orange color is pretty enough-and because we want everyone with sulfur allergies to enjoy 
them, too. Certified kosher and organic, this natural snack is so ""clean,"" it bears the exact same name as its short 
ingredients list: Organic Dried Mango. That's it!

You won't be seeing Trader Joe's pickled mangoes anytime soon, but these Organic Unsulfured Unsweetened 
Dried Mangoes are available now for just $3.99 each 6-ounce bag.

"061420","Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips","Trader Joe's Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips are spicy, ire-zest-tible little scrolls made from 
stone ground corn masa. Compared to similar snacks available elsewhere, these Chips are cut & rolled a little 
thicker for additional crunch. They're also crispier, since we've reduced the amount of water in them before they 
hit the fryer. 

Paired with this captivating crunchiness is a generous dusting of hot Chili & Lime Flavored seasoning. This 
makes for a tastefully tangy, definitely spicy profile-though we didn't get too silly with the chili, so you'll keep 
coming back to the bag for another handful. (We should also mention that the vibrant orange hue is naturally 
derived from vegetable juice, and paprika and turmeric extracts-another trait that sets this snack apart!)

While our Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips are super satisfying as a stand-alone snack, they are also the ideal 
shape for dipping in Avocado's Number Guacamole [SKU 65355], or Trader Joe's Roasted Garlic Hummus [SKU 
29911]-if you feel the need to invite garlic to the flavor-party.

to what kind of private label rice cake we might bring in, we came across a company in Belgium making a high-
quality rice cake with some very different, yet still very appealing qualities. To understand what we mean, just 
give Trader Joe's Organic Brown Rice Cake Thins a try...

For starters, these are square instead of round. They're also quite thin, as their name would imply. But despite 
their thinness, they are rather dense, so they still supply a satisfying crunch. Made simply of puffed organic 
brown rice with a light sprinkling of sea salt, Organic Brown Rice Cake Thins are an excellent snack choice. 
Each serving (six Thins!) is just 110 calories, with 1g fat and 0g sugar. They're gluten free and kosher, too!

powerhouse. With that in mind, we've expanded our Cheese Bites into some seedy territory.

Trader Joe's Super Seedy Cheese Snack Bites are bite-size squares with a Parmesan cheese base, baked with 
a crunchy blend of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, puffed quinoa, and black sesame seeds. Whole black 
peppercorns are studded throughout to give these Seedy Snack Bites a touch of peppery heat and serious cacio 
e pepe vibes. 

While our Super Seedy Cheese Snack Bites make an excellent snack on their own, their sturdy texture makes 
them dependable for dipping, too-try them with a tub of Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole [sku 71498]. 
Plus, they can also be used to elevate other dishes, especially when used as a textural modifier: crumbling a

including: coconut, smoke seasoning, sesame seeds, or dark chocolate. Just for this holiday season, we've 
created a Trio of Almonds, with three, differently dressed almonds that resonate together in perfect harmony.
 
The Trio includes roasted, salted almonds. You might call this the ""control"" variety, against which the other 
flavors are contrasted-though there's definitely nothing basic-tasting about them! The high-quality California 
almonds have been expertly roasted with just the right amount of salt to bring out their inherent nuttiness. 
The second variety in this Trio is sesame honey almonds. In fact, these are done up the very same way as what 
you'll find in our everyday bag of Sesame Honey Almonds [sku 64905], sold in our stores since 2003. The nuts 
are rolled in a mixture of sugar, butter, salt, cocoa, honey, and sesame seeds (of the teeny-tiny, Thai variety) for 
a honeyed, super-crunch, with plenty of sesame flavor. 
 
Lest you think there's nothing new to see here, we've topped off this Trio with caramel coffee almonds. These 
have been coated with coffee powder and glazed with caramel for a sweet, strong-coffee flavor that pairs well 
with the underlying nutty notes. It's a Trio of flavors that's fantastic by the handful, and an ideal partner for all 
the fizzy, festive beverages of the season.

cookie, cake, and candy world - Stroopwafel, Peppermint, Panettone, and Gingerbread. Each Truffle is about 
bite-sized, but don't let the smaller size fool you - these deliver big flavors in every bite. 

We worked closely with our U.S.-based supplier (a pretty famous chocolatier) to get the flavors and textures

folks are the most satisfied people in the world - or at least at Trader Joe's. Perhaps we should clarify that we're 
talking about Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Gingerbread Folk, the cutest dang cookies to make an 
appearance this holiday season. And not just cute... delicious and satisfying, from first bite to last.

What makes these Cookie Folk different from other Gingerbread cookies? So. Many. Things. First, unlike a 
traditional gingersnap, these are soft-baked, almost cake-like. Also, unlike so many very sweet gingerbread 
treats, these are a bit less sweet and more subtly spiced, taking those cues from European cookies like Lebkuchen 
[skus 26270 & 20734]. And finally, these are bathed in a dark chocolate coating that's firm enough to hold up 
to your grip, but still soft to the bite. Delightful with a hot cup of coffee, tea, or cocoa, these Cookies also make 
a personable statement on a cookie tray when you're having folks over for a holiday (or any day) gathering. 

We're  offering them for a limited time, during the holidays. You'll find them in 7.05-ounce packages in our 
cookie section, while we can keep them in stock.

high frustose corn syrup and artificial flavors, these generously-sized Candy Canes are made with peppermint 
oil, tapioca syrup, and colors derived from red radish. That alone would be cause for added holiday joy. And 
yet, we went further, as the need for joy knows no bounds. We can't think of anything more joy-inducing than 
getting to the center of a candy cane and finding a soft cocoa crème filling, and so, we added that soft cocoa 
crème filling. Joy, people. We're going for joy. 

We're also going for quality and tradition, so we partnered with candy cane crafters that have been in the 
business for 100 years. Notably, these Candy Canes are also hand-pulled, a process that gives them a beautiful 
sheen that will be eye-catching displayed on a hot cocoa bar, hanging from a Christmas tree or peeking out of

"074628","Belgian Cookie Trio","Made exclusively for us in Belgium, Trader Joe's Belgian Cookie Trio is a jam-packed collection of three 
golden, crisp, all-butter cookies: almond thins brilliantly dipped in milk chocolate; waffle cookies half-dipped 
in smooth dark chocolate; and butter biscuits fully enrobed in rich dark chocolate. Distilled down to two 
words? Cookie nirvana. 

Munch on them as you muse on the success of the main dining event, in lieu of (or alongside) a slice of 
pumpkin pie; offer as a fuss-free yet sublime dessert following a leftover turkey sandwich; or show yourself 
some TLC and enjoy with a hot cup of tea while you regroup for the next big holiday (they're packaged in two 
separate trays so you can serve one and keep the other fresh just for this purpose...). As destiny would have it, 
this tasty triplet will be gone in the blink of an eye, so rush to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and pick up a 
10.9-ounce box of Trader Joe's Belgian Cookie Trio for the supreme value of $5.99. As they're available for a

"067706","Organic Dark Chocolate Half-Coated Rice Cake Thins","We continue to sell the branded Lundberg Organic Brown Lightly Salted Rice Cakes [sku 45948] and our 
customers continue to enjoy their classic rice cake character: round, thick, crumbly and crunchy. As we looked 
to what kind of private label rice cake we might bring in, we came across a company in Belgium making some 
high-quality rice cakes with some very different, yet still very appealing qualities. To understand what we 
mean, you must give Trader Joe's Organic Dark Chocolate Rice Cake Thins a try...

For starters, these are square instead of round. They're also quite thin, as their name would imply. But despite 
their thinness, they are rather dense, so they still supply that satisfying crunch. The real rice-cake kicker? That 
crunch is accompanied by the smooth taste of dark chocolate, which coats one whole side of each Cake¿ Are 
they candy or rice cakes? You be the judge!

"051482","Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks","The great baking debate: Chips vs. Chunks vs. Chopped - chocolate, that is. We like to engage in all 
discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to 
create Trader Joe's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than 
our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, 
these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory 
(in cookies, let's say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some ""chocolate debris"" 
from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader 
Joe's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, 
and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also 
sensational for snacking. You don't need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all. 

Made for us by an esteemed French-Belgian chocolate company that now produces product in North 
America, our Chocolate Chunks are of the same caliber that high-end bakeries and notable candy 
manufacturers use. We think our customers deserve the best; price included. We're selling each 10 ounce 
bag of Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks for $1.99, every day. 

So... which are better? Chunks, chips, or chopped? Well, the fun part is, that's still up for debate!

confectionary coating.

That's right, we're talking pumpkin spice on pumpkin spice-a pumpkin-y one-two punch, if you will. Every 
bite starts with the soft texture of the sweet coating, which eventually gives way to the crunch of the sandwich 
cookie, finally ending once again on the smooth, pumpkin-spiced crème filling on the inside. All throughout, 
you're treated to a delightful seasonal suite of spice notes, including those of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and 
cloves. Equally excellent as a gift for any pumpkin spice devotee in your life as they are an anytime indulgence, 
our Pumpkin Spiced Joe-Joe's are a splendidly sweet way to celebrate the season

hard mini-pretzels you love as a bar snack, and flattens them into a chip-like ""Slim"" shape. Each one-two-bite-
sized Pretzel Slim is thin, crispy, and studded with coarse crystal of salt, just like a classic pretzel. Unlike your 
everyday pretzel, however, their increased surface area allows them to be used as a vehicle for  a wide variety 
of dips, cheeses, spreads - even salsas, if you so choose - meaning these Pretzel Slims aren't just delicious, 
they're postively practical.

Made from just four simple ingredients (wheat flour, sugar, salt, and barley malt syrup), we reccomend dunking 
your Pretzel Slims into Pub Cheese with Jalapeños [sku 92527], Organic Buffalo Style Hummus [sku 63040],  
or even a jar of Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce [sku 27677]. Dip averse? They're still quite delicious on their own,

"074111","Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies","As a lauded philosopher once said, ""C is for cookie; that's good enough for me."" This deceptively simple 
axiom belies a deeper truth: any time taken to enjoy a cookie is time well spent. So when life gives you 
an opportunity to indulge in a multitude of miniaturized cookies, like the ones you'll find in every petite, 
portable pouch of Trader Joe's Mini Chocolate Chip Cookies, the proposition to munch away is practically 
a categorical imperative (with apologies to another philosopher-we simply Kant help ourselves).

Perfectly sized for goody-bag-packing, back-to-school gifting, or simply as a grab-and-go sweet snack, 
each two-ounce pouch is filled with crunchy, buttery, taste-like-homemade Cookies that are packed with a 
plethora of Chocolate Chips. Speaking of perfectly sized, these Cookies are impeccably proportioned to 
get the most of their satisfyingly crispy texture and ensure that every bite is brimming with sweet, creamy 
chocolate. And since they're such an excellent value, they're an easy choice for grabbing as a treat during 
your regular shopping run. Here's a quick bit of utilitarian philosophy: keeping a pouch in your bag or desk 
in case of snacking emergencies will most definitely maximize the well-being of you and those around you.

"057243","Oven-Baked Cheese Bites","It's no secret that we love cheese here at Trader Joe's-stroll on over to our cheese case and you'll see what we 
mean. And what is there not to love? Cheese just makes everything better. (See: burgers, baked potatoes, pasta, 
crackers, casseroles, omelets, sandwiches, vegetables... ad infinitum.) So why, then, should you not be able to 
enjoy cheese anytime, anywhere? That's a trick question, because you should be able to enjoy cheese anytime, 
anywhere. Now, with a pouch of Trader Giotto's Oven-Baked Cheese Bites in hand, you can.   

The brainchild of a historic, Italian dairy and a well-known Grana Padano producer, Trader Giotto's Oven-
Baked Cheese Bites are a snack time dream come true. Made with a tangy blend of Grana Padano and semi-
aged cheese, these crunchy little nuggets are boldly cheesy, packed with protein (15 grams per serving), and all 
but carbohydrate-free (less than one gram per serving). And thanks to some nifty, patented baking technology, 
these Cheese Bites are completely shelf-stable, even without the use of additional preservatives. 

Munch on a handful (or two¿or three¿) of Oven-Baked Cheese Bites anytime you're craving a snack that 
really satisfies. Crumble them atop salads or open-faced sandwiches to add a cheesy, crouton-y crunch without 
the extra carbs. Or toss a few atop a bowl of hot Organic Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Soup [sku 57879] for 
some extra umami on a cold, rainy day. 

The lowest we've seen similar cheese snacks retail for elsewhere is $3.99 per pouch (and we've seen 'em for as 
much as $5.99 per pouch-eek!), so we are thrilled to be selling each 2.12-ounce pouch of Trader Giotto's 
Oven-Baked Cheese Bites for $2.49. You'll find them in our snack aisle.

"072562","Soft-Baked Sunflower Butter Cookies","Just as the sight of a beautiful, blossoming sunflower is enough to brighten anyone's day, one bite of a Trader 
Joe's Soft-Baked Sunflower Butter Cookie is enough to sweeten yours. It's made from a base of earthy, nutty 
sunflower butter (it's the first ingredient, in fact), to which our supplier adds an assortment of gluten free flours 
and vegan sources of sweetness, including cane sugar, dates, and pear juice concentrate, as well as a generous 
amount of roasted sunflower seeds. They then bake them to a perfectly pleasing soft texture, which not only 
interacts wonderfully with the crunch of the seeds, but accentuates its interplay of sweet and savory flavors, too.

Sized about one or two bites, these Sunflower Butter Cookies make an excellent, peanut-free dessert for school 
lunches, a great mid-morning pick-me-up with a cup of coffee or tea, or even just an anytime indulgence. In 
addition to being vegan, kosher (pareve), and gluten free, they also contain no soy, sesame, or tree nuts, making 
them a great option for allergen-conscious sharing. Try them dunked in an ice-cold glass of milk or your 
favorite dairy-free alternative, and your day will be a little sweeter and brighter in no time.

weren't as satisfying as they were when they launched back in 2013. Never ones to settle for second-rate sweets, 
our buyers seized the opportunity to improve upon the existing product, making it their mission to upgrade 
Trader Joe's Gluten Free Joe-Joe's with the latest in gluten free baked good technology-backed by a baking 
partner with more than 65 years of experience, no less-and lo and behold, here we are! 

Made for us in Canada with a masterful mix of rice flour, tapioca starch, oat flour, and cornstarch, the new 
(and greatly improved, might we add) Cookies deliver a substantially snappy crunch, along with plenty of rich 
chocolate flavor thanks to the addition of cocoa and semisweet chocolate. Sandwiched between those crisp 
cookies you'll find a velvety smooth, vanilla flavored crème, with visible vanilla bean specks throughout-in 
short, they're everything a Sandwich Cookie should be. Still kosher (dairy)-certified, and, in case it needs 
repeating, still Gluten Free, these Chocolate Vanilla Creme Sandwich Cookies are ready for nibbling,

"007998","Dry Roasted & Salted Pistachios","Like many foods that we commonly refer to as nuts, technically, Pistachios are not a nut, but rather the seed of 
the pistachio tree. A distant cousin of the similarly-not-a-nut cashew, Pistachios nonetheless have all the same 
satisfyingly savory flavor and craveable crunch of a nut, so we will continue to group them in with the other 
nuts (besides, we don't plan on creating a separate ""Seeds"" aisle in our stores anytime soon). And Trader Joe's 
Dry Roasted & Salted Pistachios exhibit everything that have made them such a pervasively popular snack.

Grown for us in California's San Joaquin Valley, these particular Pistachios are dry roasted, which means they 
were cooked without the use of a medium like oil or water. This gives each Pistachio a delightfully chewy texture 
which interplays impeccably with their naturally mild, buttery flavor profile, which in turn is accentuated by 
the addition of salt. They're just as fun to crack open as they are delicious, making them a great snack for 
spectating sports, enjoying with drinks, or simply everyday snacking.

And on top of that, Trader Joe's Dry Roasted & Salted Pistachios are a great value. Nut or not, you can find 
16-ounce bags every day in our nuts & dried fruit section.

"071242","Strawberry Vanilla Yogurt Pretzels","These treats are described on the package as ""teeny tiny pretzels covered & drizzled with a yogurt candy 
coating."" That kind of says it all, right? Weeelllll¿ there's always more.

Did you know that micro-pretzels are a thing? They are. And they're in this pink bag. They're petite. And 
because they're pretzels, they're just so satisfying: the crunch, the salt, the subtle maltiness. We've found a way 
to make them even more satisfying, but drenching them in a strawberry yogurt candy coating - some white 
with pink drizzle, some pink with white drizzle. If you're a fan of our Strawberry Yogurt O's cereal, you already 
know this combination is irresistible. Take that same flavor combo, add even more crunchy texture, and make 
it mini? OMGoodness, how could you possibly resist?

If super cute and really yummy is your bag, we suggest you swing by and grab a seven ounce bag (or two!) of 
kosher certified Trader Joe's Strawberry & Vanilla Flavored Yogurt Pretzels before they're gone - they're 
only in our stores for a limited time.

sandwich cookie, Trader Joe's Strawberry Lemonade Joe-Joe's are the latest in the hallowed line of special 
edition, seasonally inspired Joe-Joe's cookies that magically appear on our shelves throughout the year. On 
the outside, you'll find two, golden, lemon-flavored wafer cookies that are made with dried lemon and natural 
lemon flavor for extra zesty oomph. Nestled between these tart, snappy wafers is a smooth crème filling bursting 
with bright strawberry notes, which is further enhanced by the inclusion of actual bits of dried strawberry. If 
these cookies sound scrumptious, that's because they are-it's an instance where the resulting treat is somehow 
even more tasty than the sum of its sweetly splendid parts.

Fair warning-the magical appearance of this kosher-certified, nostalgic nosh on our cookie shelves is limited,

"070860","Peanut Butter Caramel Coated Popcorn","With the depth and breadth of fantastical flavors and captivating crunch on offer, the snack shelves at Trader 
Joe's have been known to elicit a ""kid-in-a-candy-store"" level of excitement from even the most reserved 
customers. From decidedly savory, to hot & smoky, and everything in between, it is truly a snacker's paradise. 
Joining the sweet & salty section of our celebrated snack ranks (just in time for road trip season!) is Trader 
Joe's Peanut Butter Caramel Coated Popcorn. 

Our supplier starts with puffy, mushroom kernel popcorn, suitably shaped for coating in a sweet syrup of tapioca 
and cane sugar. This Caramel Coated Popcorn is followed by a second coating, this time in the form of salted 
Peanut Butter, which takes the Popcorn from, ""Oh, this is good,"" to ""OMGoodness, this is incredible!"" And 
though the Popcorn is contending with two coatings, it somehow manages to retain a seemingly impossible 
airiness and oh-so satisfying crunch. Mad science? We like to call it snack science, dear reader, and it is tasty, 
indeed.

"097226","Quinoa and Black Bean infused Tortilla Chips","A great appetizer should whet the palate and get your taste buds in tune for the meal ahead. By that metric, 
chips and salsa may just be one of the best appetizers in the history of the form. From the initial crunch of the 
chip, to the zesty thrill of the salsa, all the way to how perfectly their combination sets you up for the savory, 
spicy meal ahead, chips and salsa have it all. Of the many chips that we offer, one sticks out in our minds as 
being particularly well suited to the aforementioned appetizer partnership: Trader Joe's Quinoa and Black 
Bean Infused Tortilla Chips.

The mix of red Quinoa and robust Black Beans included in the base recipe of these white corn Tortilla Chips 
lends them a pleasant, earthy nuttiness that plays particularly well with the tangy notes of salsa. Their hexagon 
shape allows for optimal grip when dealing with more formidable dips, such as Organic Chunky Homestyle 
Guacamole [sku 71498] or Organic Vegan Nacho Dip [sku 73435]. Be sure to keep a bag of these gluten free,

Pretzel Nuggets [00691]. Of course, it's also in jars-as in our good ol' Creamy Salted Peanut Butter [sku 11999]! 
It's about time we put it into cookies, right?

Trader Joe's Crispy Crunchy Peanut Butter Cookies are everything a cookie-craving, peanut-butter-loving 
person would appreciate. These round, golden-brown Cookies are, indeed, Crispy and Crunchy, like their 
Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookie [sku 10727] cousin. Here, instead of chocolate chips, you'll find a power-
trio of blanched peanuts, dry roasted peanuts, and peanut butter. This triple peanutty perspective is concocted 
with the usual cookie-recipe suspects (sugar, flour, eggs, etc.), including salted butter, which brings with it a 
richness, a smoothness, a...buttery-ness.

Of course, before you know it, that lingering buttery flavor gives way to something else... another Crispy

be a stretch to call them fancy, per se. Unless, of course, you're talking about Trader Joe's Fancy Cheese 
Crunchies. Made for us by an expert snack supplier, each of these Crunchies starts with a base of heirloom 
corn, which is baked (not fried, mind you) and flavored with a mix of Cheddar and Parmesan cheese, as well 
as a bit of earthy, umami-rich, black truffle salt. The result is a snack that has a certain air of sophistication to 
it, but still stays true to its fun, familiar origins. 

Made especially for us by a renowned Black-owned and women-owned snack supplier, every bite of these 
Fancy Cheese Crunchies offers intoxicatingly truffle-forward aromas and a one-two punch of umami and 
Parmesan flavor. They're a natural fit for dinner parties and cocktail hours that straddle the line of swanky and 
spontaneous, but we also find that they're a great option for simple, anytime snacking, especially when having 
folks over for a movie or game night. And if you're looking for something to make your work or school lunches 
a little more special, they pair perfectly with a sandwich or salad.

"060564","Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers","Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the 
cob known as elote. While the fixins may vary from vendor to vendor, elotes typically come slathered in mayo 
or a crema-based sauce, rolled in grated cotija or añejo cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime 
juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero (or making elotes at home) can tell you, it's a 
highly craveable combination of flavors that's sure to leave an impression. It's left such an impression on us, in 
fact, that it inspired our latest, exclusive-to-TJ's snack: Trader Joe's Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers. 

Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they're usually served on a stick), but these Organic Elote Corn Chip 
Dippers take elote-portability to the next level. Now you can enjoy all of that corny, creamy, spiced elote flavor¿ 
in a chip! And in a Trader Joe's Organic Corn Chip Dipper, at that - our original Dippers [sku 92482] have 
been a Customer & Crew favorite for years. With a hint of chipotle, a kick of smoky heat, and a bit of buttermilk-y 
tang, these Chips have loads of flavor on their own, but they're perfect for plunging into guacamole or TJ's 
Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa [sku 62789]. Or, for some extra-punchy nachos, try melting some shredded TJ's 
Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923] over them¿ ¡Que delicioso!

"055005","Organic Apple Banana Fruit Sauce Crushers","Applesauce has been delighting snacky children and adults for years, and since people started packaging it for 
sale, it's been delivered in jars, tins, and even little plastic tubs. More recently, some brilliant person figured out 
how to put applesauce into handy, squeezable pouches. Trader Joe's picked up on this innovation early on, and 
the introduction of our Applesauce Crushers [sku 92541] was met with great excitement and success. It wasn't 
long before we created additional crushable flavors, including Apple Banana [sku 96161], Apple Strawberry [sku 
97902], and Apple Carrot [sku 92540]. 

These convenient, drinkable applesauces have become favorites of our customers, especially among parents with 
young kids (and among the kids, themselves!), so we would never think of changing them-that is, unless we 
found a way to improve them. In fact, we've found two ways to improve them¿ First, we found a supplier who 
could make our Fruit Sauce Crushers with 100% Organic ingredients. With a new supplier and new ingredi-
ents, our Tasting Panel took this opportunity to revisit each flavor profile. Where we didn't match the original 
flavor profile 100%, we improved the flavor. In the case of our Organic Apple Banana Crushers, organic banana 
puree is blended with organic apple puree and juice, for a smooth, banana flavored applesauce.

But there's yet another way we've improved upon these squeezable snacks: Price. Conventional wisdom would 
say that an organic product is going to cost more than a non-organic product. In this case, we've not only been 
able to avoid the price bump, we've actually been able to lower the price! Each 12.7 ounce box of four, 3.17 ounce 
Organic Apple Banana Fruit Sauce Crushers is now $2.79-That's $0.20 less that our non-organic version! We 
might also mention that this price crushes our competition... but we won't, 'cause that would be rude.

Bars come in threes-three individually wrapped Bars, neatly stacked in a single box. But there's even more 
about these Bars that makes them ""better,"" especially if you're someone who is avoiding dairy...

These Oat Chocolate Bars are made by our bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia who combines cane sugar, cocoa 
butter, and 40% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate) to create a 
very delicious chocolate bar. The trickiest part is that they use a combination of ground oats and rice syrup 
(think oat ""milk"") to make it lusciously creamy, just like milk chocolate. Only, there's no milk! Nor is there any 
soy or gluten in these totally vegan Oat Chocolate Bars.

"094599","Everything but the Bagel Seasoned Crackers","Some folks like their crackers on the naked side, wearing nothing at all. Some folks like a little salt to season 
their snacking crackers. And some folks aren't satisfied with either of those options. For those among you, 
Trader Joe's Bite Size Crackers may just be the ultimate cracker. These bite-sized crackers are made with 
whole wheat flour and rolled oats, then cut in squares - and the best part - they're topped with garlic, onion, 
sesame, poppy and caraway seeds. Just like our Everything But the Bagel Seasoning [sku 59137] and Everything 
Bagel [sku 92267], this is Everything on a Cracker.  

Okay, so we'll admit - maybe these crackers don't have everything on them. We left out some things, like 
artificial flavors and artificial colors. We're pretty sure, though, you won't have a problem with that. After 
all, when you're looking for a cracker to crunch, great taste seems to make a whole lot more sense. They are 
Everything you would want in a cracker, when you're desires strike more than a plain ol' snack. You'll find each

54% Dark Chocolate Bar, bedecked it with bits of TJ's Pinks & Whites Shortbread Cookies [sku 56959] (plus 
a few whole cookies, too!), and festooned it with festive, spring-hued sprinkles. The result is both a vision to 
behold and a sweet treat to savor.

Each three-ounce Pinks & Whites Dark Chocolate Bar comes scored, so you can break it into eight, even 
pieces to share with friends, fairies, and fellow spring sprites alike! If you're anything like us, though, you might 
struggle to share a confection of this caliber... Plus, you'll probably want to grab a few extra for Easter and other 
such spring celebrations¿ So, really, regardless of your stance on dessert distribution, it's time to hightail it to 
Trader Joe's-because once this Bar is gone, it's gone for good. Or at least until next spring hath sprung.

"072136","Sour Cream & Onion Flavored Rings","Sour cream & onion is about as classic as snack flavors come. Typically, this savory taste is  applied to chips of 
some kind. But we got to thinking that rings might be a great way to convey sour cream & onion from snack 
to mouth, given the also classic nature of fried, restaurant-style onion rings. This way of thinking led to the 
creation of Trader Joe's Sour Cream & Onion Flavored Rings-only, we decided to rethink the usual breaded 
and fried approach...

While these Rings are indeed round, they don't actually contain a ring of onion. Instead, these mini (about 
two-bite-sized) snacks are made using red lentils and rice meal. Not only does this mean they are gluten 
free, it also makes them wonderfully crunchy. They are baked (not fried) and infused with a Sour Cream & 
Onion seasoning that includes buttermilk solids, onion & sour cream powders, and yeast extract-all of which 
combine to create an irresistible and inviting flavor. As snacks come, you might say this one's a ""ringer""!

"010009","50% Less Salt Roasted & Salted Peanuts","As opposed to nuts like almonds, cashews, and other nuts that grow on trees, peanuts grow beneath the soil's 
surface and are botanically considered legumes. In other words, although we think of peanuts as nuts, they're 
technically not even classified as one! It's all a bit nutty - especially since peanuts actually have the ""nut"" in 
their name - but regardless, people go nuts for Trader Joe's 50% Less Salt Roasted & Salted Peanuts!

After being shelled, these Peanuts are roasted in peanut oil, which is how they get their extra-crunchy, never-
soggy, golden surfaces. While they're still warm from the roasting, we add the salt - but not too much salt. After 
all, these are our 50% Less Salt Peanuts, for goodness' sake! It's all about the balance. Keep a bag of Peanuts at 
work as a satiating snack-at-the-ready. Add them to sweet or savory snack mixes, or even homemade granola

Our Cinna-Dragons come in a handy, seven-ounce, resealable pouch, making them a great choice for taking 
along with you on all sorts of side quests, be it a weekend matinee, an extended road trip, or an especially 
spirited board game night. We particularly like mixing them with a bit of popcorn for an even more complex

"072051","Rosemary Croissant Croutons","Consider, for a moment, the crouton. Perhaps you haven't given croutons much thought in the past - an 
entirely understandable position to be in, given that they're hardly ever the focus of a meal. As purveyors (and 
appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on 
the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous 
amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from 
a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like 
rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe's Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born.

Truly a breakthrough for the medium, these Rosemary Croissant Croutons take everything about a classic 
crouton to the next level. The buttery, laminated nature of the dough they're made from results in a remarkably 
resounding crunch. The satisfyingly savory flavor of the rosemary synergizes spectacularly with everything 
from creamy Caesar salads to zesty tomato bisques or even hearty, homemade French onion soups. But that's 
hardly all - they're also great when crushed coarsely and used as a topping for scalloped potatoes or a breading 
for a juicy pork cutlet. And as long we're considering croutons in general, feel free to consider Trader Joe's 
Rosemary Croissant Croutons a decidedly delicious snack in their own right.

"080665","Freeze Dried Strawberries","Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Strawberries are strawberry slices that have undergone a special freeze-drying 
process so they remain extremely flavorful, but unlike so many conventionally dried berries, they're free of 
added sugar and they pack a bit of a crunch. They're great for snacking anytime - we've discovered that kids, 
especially, find them not only delicious but fascinating as well. Lest you think they're only for kids, we'll go on 
record as grown-up fans of these crunchy little berries - they're especially delightful added to cereals for a little 
extra flavor and crunch. Of course, given their history as a backpacking staple, they're perfectly at home on the 
trail, as part of a mix or on their own.

Trader Joe's Freeze Dried Strawberries come in a 1.2 ounce resealable bag - that may not sound like much, but 
it takes ten times that amount (12 ounces) of fresh, ripe strawberries from California's coastal growing regions 
to produce this much freeze dried fruit. We recommend that you keep the bag tightly sealed after opening to 
preserve the crunch, though in the spirit of full disclosure, we'll admit they don't usually last long enough that 
this ever becomes an issue. 

We're selling each 1.2 ounce bag for $3.49.

practically conventional wisdom, at this point. But what you might not know is just how perfectly this pair

brought chocolate and peanut butter's iconic mix of savory sweet together with the phenomenally fluffy texture 
of a light, airy marshmallow to create a marvelous new candy creation that's even more scrumptious than the 
sum of its parts.

These oh-so-craveable confections are crafted with sweet, delicately-cocoa-infused marshmallows (made for 
us by the same supplier as our seasonal marshmallows), which have been covered in a candy shell-like peanut 
butter coating, then topped with a chocolatey drizzle to really bring it all together. Each bite starts with the 
pop of the peanut butter coating, then continues through to the sublime softness of the marshmallow inside, 
creating a flavor and texture interaction that must be experienced to be believed. Speaking of which, if you 
want to experience Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Cocoa Marshmallows, you'll need to act quickly, because 
they're only around for a limited time.

"073406","Dark Chocolate Strawberry Bar","Our customers adore dark chocolate. They also happen to be smitten with strawberries. It only seemed 
natural, then, to couple these favored flavors in a Cupid-worthy, limited edition Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate 
Strawberry Bar. A velvety base of dark chocolate made with 58% cacao encases a lusciously sweet filling of 
strawberry juice concentrate, strawberry powder, and natural strawberry flavor. The back of the bar is adorned 
with pieces of freeze-dried strawberries, ensuring maximum strawberry essence, and providing a slightly 
crunchy counterpoint to each bite of smooth dark chocolate. Swoon.

We find that our Dark Chocolate Strawberry Bar's enticing mix of sweet fruitiness and rich dark chocolate,

choice for a dessert or snack, especially when paired with a crisp sparkling wine. And though surely, it's what's 
inside that counts, the Bar's pretty, pink, strawberry & paisley-patterned packaging makes it a charming gift 
for the chocolate-lover in your life-even if that happens to be you!

We sell them plain, filled, coated, with salted and unsalted varietals, we just can't get enough-which is why 
we're introducing Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Almond Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets! We use our very own 
Almond Butter Filled Pretzels [sku 70721] and enrobe them in a luxurious Dark Chocolate coating, made with 
50% cacao. For a delicious marriage of salty and sweet, we use a 1:1 ratio of Chocolate to Pretzel. What's more, 
they are packed in a convenient, resealable pouch-perfect for tossing in your bag and snacking on-the-go.

They're great on their own or combined with nuts and dried fruit for a decadent trek mix. Or even crumble

when you realize they're made from just four ingredients: peanut butter, corn grits, sunflower oil, and salt. 
There's really no reason to add anything else to these nearly perfect peanut puffs... unless that something else 
is chocolate. So, we did!

The longer side of each Dark Chocolate Bamba is dipped in dark chocolate. The smooth, semi-sweet chocolate 
provides a lovely contrast to the crunchy, peanutty flavor. Enjoy them by the handful whenever you're in a 
Bamba mood, but craving something just a little bit sweeter.

"056016","Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds","There's a good reason chocolate and almonds are put together so frequently - they're quite possibly each 
other's perfect pair, both flavor and texture-wise. Almonds are crunchy and naturally rich, while chocolate, 
in its various incarnations, is sweet, creamy and smooth. In Trader Joe's Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate 
Almonds, all of these flavors and textures come together to create a rich, sweet, creamy, smooth, crunchy, bite-
size treat you can have at your fingertips.

Our Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate Almonds begin with dry-roasted, California-grown almonds and are 
finished, by hand, in small batches, using chocolate produced from a proprietary blend of cocoa beans from 
around the world. Our supplier drenches about half of the almonds in sweet & creamy Milk Chocolate, and 
the other half are bathed in rich & luxurious Dark Chocolate. Enjoy one at a time or pop one of each in your 
mouth to really experience the magical mingling of flavors.

We're selling Premium Milk & Dark Chocolate Almonds in a 16-ounce tub for the enchanted everyday price

"012564","Pretzel Sticks","Did you know? While they're often associated with medieval German monks, modern evidence seems to point 
to either southern France or northern Italy, circa 600 CE as the true point of origin for the pretzel. Today, 
however, we'd like to give kudos to the nameless, faceless, timeless creators of that prized pretzel variation, the 
Stick. Easy to fit in a shirt pocket, captivatingly crunchy, and helpful in any Groucho Marx impersonation, 
pretzel sticks are perhaps the ultimate interpretation of this ages-old snack. And Trader Joe's Pretzel Sticks 
may be the ultimate interpretration of that ultimate interpretation. 

Golden brown, slightly salty, and tinged with just a hint of baked-in honey sweetness, Trader Joe's Pretzel 
Sticks are equally great on their own or dipped in your favorite mustard, cheese dip, or even salsa. That's just 
for starters: we find that they dazzle when dunked in everything from hummus to fondue, Chunky Artichoke & 
Jalapeño Dip [sku 54698] to Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce [sku 95214], your favorite nut butter to our very own 
Speculoos Cookie Butter [sku 96761] and everything in between. And, of course, we'd be remiss if we didn't

Pretzels [skus 00690 & 00691] and wondered why we haven't capitalized on that by stuffing crunchy pretzel 
nuggets with other nut-based butters. The reality is, we have pondered this question, and we have been busy for 
quite a while making sure we got it right. With the introduction of  Trader Joe's Almond Butter Filled Pretzel 
Nuggets, we're quite certain we got it right. In other words, if nut butter and pretzels are your jam, you're going 
to find these little Nuggets irresistible.

Like their PBP cousins, these feature about-an-inch long, crunchy pretzel nuggets whose exterior is generously 
crusted wtih rock salt. Inside, it's an almond butter abondanza. Really. More than 35% of the recipe here is 
almond butter, made from almonds grown in California's Central Valley. Every bite is crunchy (outside) and 
creamy (inside); salty (outside) and a little sweet (inside). Pair them with a cold lager or a glass of lemonade. 
Enjoy them on their own or as part of a trail mix. We recommend keeping a bag in your desk drawer for mid-
afternoon snacking emergencies - we recommend opening the 12 ounce bag before you need it for quickest,

A sandwich cookie twist well worth writing home 'aboot', our supplier begins with two flavorful, crunchy 
shortbread cookies formed into charming maple leaf shapes. These provide the necessary polarity to the 
mouthwatering maple creme filling. Rich and creamy with flavor from real Canadian maple syrup, Trader

impressive array of flavors, cuts and serving sizes to meet the needs of every enjoyer of almonds, from plain to  
Thai Lime [sku 51511] to Mesquite Smoke Seasoned [sku 98895] and everything in between. For customers in 
need of almonds for baking or decorative purposes, we even offer Trader Joe's Unsalted Dry Toasted Slivered 
Almonds: delicious, savory, full-flavored almonds sliced into perfect matchstick slivers.

Made using the same, Central California-grown Almonds that we sell whole, our supplier takes the extra step 
of dry toasting these Almonds to crunchy perfection, heating them up just enough to make them pliable for 
slicing without shattering, then cuts them into thin, aesthetically pleasing slivers. It's almost impossible to cut 
almonds into slivers this regular and uniform at home, using regular kitchen tools, which makes our Slivered 
Almonds all the more convenient. That's all the more important, considering that their shape not only looks 
great when placed atop a cookie, bowl of oatmeal, or salad, but also nicely accentuates their texture and flavor. 
Whether you're using them for their visual, culinary, or simple snacking qualities, Trader Joe's Unsalted Dry 
Toasted Slivered Almonds are tasty, convenient, and a great value - which is exactly why we've kept them on 
the shelf for over 15 years.

"062405","Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt","Seaweed grows in the ocean-not in fields on land-so the idea of ""organic"" seaweed may seem a little strange. 
What, then, makes Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt ""organic""?

Well, in farming conventional seaweed, farmers typically use food-grade acid to eliminate the presence of un-
wanted species growing on the underwater crop. Instead of using these chemicals, however, the South Korean 
farmers who grow our Organic Seaweed use two natural methods to control pests. Seaweed is grown on ropes 
that are either attached to floating buoys, or to fixed poles in shallower tidal waters. When the buoys rotate, the 
seaweed is exposed to sunlight. Likewise, when the tide is low, the poles are ""raised"" out of the water, allowing 
sunlight to reach the seaweed. In both cases, it's the exposure to sunlight that naturally controls the growth of 
unwanted species on the crop.

Once harvested, this seaweed is roasted, cut, lightly misted with organic sunflower oil, & sprinkled with sea salt 
(the oil makes the salt stick.) The result is a yummy snack that is perfectly salty and rich in umami. This snack is 
made even more perfect by our packaging-six, 0.17-ounce mini-packs, sold together in one, 1.05-ounce clear 
package. These little packs are small enough to stow anywhere-lunch boxes, desk drawers, backpacks, purses-
but big enough to satisfy your savory snack cravings!

We're selling each 1.05-ounce pack of six, 0.17-ounce, individually-wrapped packages of Trader Joe's Organic 
Roasted Seaweed with Sea Salt for $3.49. Find them in our snack aisle.

"071323","Organic Cacio e Pepe Puffs","Cacio e pepe may just be the perfect example of two flavors combining to become more than the sum of their 
parts. Together, the savory sharpness of Cheddar and Romano and the bracing bite of cracked black pepper 
take on delicious, subtle complexity, far beyond what its simple construction would suggest. As proof of this 
pairing's power to elevate any dish its added to, we offer Trader Joe's Organic Cacio E Pepe Puffs, a delightfully 
satisfying snack that adds yet another dimension to this comfort food combo: light, airy crunchiness.

Starting from a base of puffed organic corn meal and organic brown rice flour, our supplier coats these 
delicately crispy Puffs with a seasoning blend that includes dried, organic Cheddar and Romano cheeses and 
organic black pepper. With every bite, you get both the classically cheesy and peppery cacio e pepe profile, and a 
resoundingly crunchy texture that keeps you coming back for more. They're an ideal mix of simple and elegant, 
making them a great option for anytime snacking occasions, like movie nights or game days, as well as more 
formal applications, like crushing up and using as the bread crumb topping of a baked macaroni and cheese.

Trader Joe's holiday season favorite, Dark Chocolate Stars [sku 90959], Trader Joe's Mini Dark Chocolate Mint 
Stars are a wonderful addition to the family. 

The Stars here may be smaller, but they're outfitted with a big boost of flavor from both chocolate and mint. 
Inside the smooth, rich, dark chocolate coating you'll find chocolate shortbread cookies that have been infused 
with the coolness of mint. Each cookie is liberally adorned with nonpareils, which add not only visual appeal,

"071814","Hot Cocoa Ornaments","For those who decorate a tree in December, hanging the variety of Christmas ornaments you've collected 
over the years is a joyous tradition. While most ornaments are prized for the way they dangle on the boughs 
and sparkle under the festive lights, we've got some ornaments that will no doubt be prized for an altogether 
different function...

Trader Joe's Hot Cocoa Ornaments certainly look like actual Christmas tree ornaments. The package contains 
four, large, spherical bulbs. Each one is a different color (red, yellow, blue, or green) and covered in a glittery, 
edible coating. That's right, we said edible! Rather than being hung on a tree, however, these ornaments are 
meant to be dunked into a steaming mug of milk-or your favorite non-dairy beverage. 

Once submerged, the shimmering, milk-chocolate shell (including a delicious hint of mint), slowly melts away, 
revealing a secret stash of marshmallows and chocolate chips. Stir until everything is dissolved to your liking, 
then enjoy your mug of mint chocolate hot cocoa with marshmallows!

"094062","Chocolate Passport","Much like wine, the characteristics of good chocolate are heavily influenced by the earth in which the cacao 
beans are grown. Trader Joe's Chocolate Passport takes you on a journey through the terroirs of the cacao-
growing world - Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, The Dominican Republic, Ghana, Papua New Guinea, Sao Tome, 
and Tanzania - delivering a collection of eight distinctive bars of chocolate with cacao solids ranging from 
60% to 73%. Each bar conveys character, beyond just ""chocolate,"" typical for its region. Savor a bite and you 
may detect jasmine, dried grass, fresh fruit, wood, flowers, and vanilla.

As you've surely gathered, this is chocolate to be savored. Take a bite, let it linger, and then try another. In honor 
of the worldly nature of the chocolate's origins, we've placed them in a handsome, highly-giftable, passport-like 
package. Give one to a friend with unsatiated wanderlust, a coworker with a refined palate, or yourself, if you 
happen to be a fan of world-class chocolate. Unlike the cost of booking a trip to one of these cacao-growing 
regions, each Chocolate Passport will cost you $9.99-the same price as when we first launched it in 2012.

While in the midst of contemplating our annual holiday lineup, one of our buyers brought a new Pound Plus

you to take another bite. It's wrapped in a festively-designed package (especially festive for the pretzel lovers

Chocolate Covered Caramel Popcorn with Sea Salt, Dark Chocolate Covered Bite-Size Chocolate Vanilla Creme 
Joe Joe's Cookies and festive Red Candy Coated Chocolate Pieces. Whew. We know it's a lot, but all of these 
pieces mix together to complete Trader Joe's Jingle Jangle of really good stuff. The combination of textures and 
flavors is a song in the making-crunchy, soft, smooth, fluffy, crumbly, creamy...sweet, chocolaty, salty, nutty, 
buttery, chocolaty (yes, again)... It's as merry and adventurous as it sounds. And it's truly a Trader Joe's tune.

This jolly tin is such that you just want to pick it up and shake it, as you know the exclusive collection of 
chocolate-covered fan favorites (with a few festive accents) will deliver that satisfying Jingle Jangle. But the real 
merriment is made when the lid is lifted, revealing the righteous medley of goodies. We dare you not to eat the 
whole container in one sitting. If you can manage to part with this delicious jumble, a tin of Jingle Jangle makes 
the perfect gift for party-throwers and chocolate-lovers alike.

Jingle Jangle is the ultimate party treat, outshines in the hostess gift realm, and is really just fun fare for game 
night or any night (or afternoon, for that matter). Made just for us, and only in limited quantities, you won't 
want to miss the chance to Jingle Jangle this season, especially at just $8.99 for each 22.7-ounce container.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/51324.png","9.99","[""Desk Drawer"",""Family Style"",""Giftable"",""Merry-making"",""Treat Yourself""]","[""Kosher""]","[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1/3 cup (34g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""170 ""}]"
"061040","Stroopwafel Dutch Caramel Waffle Cookies","You mean you haven't heard of stroopwafeling? It's only the trendiest way to enjoy this year's soon-to-be most 
popular Tin of Dutch cookies. But don't take our word for it - Stroop for yourself! Pour yourself a piping hot 
mug of your favorite TJ's coffee, tea, or cocoa and cover it with a Trader Joe's Stroopwafel. (Fear not, our Stroop-
wafel cookies are conveniently flat, thin, and large enough to cover even the mouthiest of mugs.) Then, sit back 
and watch the steam melt the Stroopwafel's thin caramel filling into the ideal state of gooeyness, perfectly soften-
ing the two thin ""waffles"" that it's sandwiched between. There. Now you've got yourself a perfectly stroopwafeled 
Stroopwafel. 

Now that you understand stroopwafeling, let's talk about the Trader Joe's Stroopwafel Tin that makes 
stroopwafeling possible. First created in the Dutch city of Gouda (yes, that Gouda), stroopwafels (literally Dutch 
for ""syrup waffles"") quickly became a national treasure. Our Stroopwafels are made in the Netherlands, honoring 
this tradition. First, a dough thicker than typical waffle batter is pressed in a waffle iron and quickly cut in half 
while still hot. Then, gooey, stretchy caramel is slathered between the two waffle ""halves,"" forming the most 
delightful waffle sandwich cookie you'll ever encounter. In Amsterdam, Stroopwafels are often enjoyed fresh off 
the waffle iron, but since we can't take you all to the Netherlands, we strongly encourage stroopwafeling  instead. 

Stroopwafeling is all the rage this holiday season, but it most certainly won't break the bank. An 11.29-ounce 
Trader Joe's Stroopwafel Tin is $2.99-a value that'll let you stroopwafel all season long.

"020487","Panettone","By now, we can (almost) all agree that fruitcakes make better doorstops than cakes. Don't be too quick to 
relegate Trader Giotto's Panettone to the fruitcake category, though. It is a cake that has fruit in it, but this is 
no fruitcake. It's much too tasty. 

Traditional Italian panettone is as much a part of the holiday season at Trader Joe's as Hawaiian shirts and 
chalkboard signs. Trader Giotto's Panettone is an exceptionally moist cake that can take more than two days 
to rise and then ten more to cool completely a¿ er baking. It's cra¿ ed in Veneto, Italy, (a region known for its 
panettone prowess) from a traditional family recipe, using real butter and plump, juicy raisins, with candied 
fruit studded throughout the loaf. 

It begins with a sourdough starter and ends with your stomach full of a cake with exquisite ¿ avor and texture, 
full of plump raisins and sweet candied fruit. ¿ is is a cake large enough (not to mention tasty enough) to share 
with the whole family. Yes, even your great-aunt Betty will be overjoyed to partake in the panettone party.

Best of all, each 26.5 ounce Trader Giotto's Panettone is a mere $4.99. ¿ at's the same price we had way back in 
2001. Just think of it as a continuation of Trader Joe's tradition of o¿ ering terri¿ c values, every day.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m21002/20487.png","6.99","[""Merry-making""]",,"[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1/9th cake (80g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""270 ""}]"
"068819","Decked Out Tree Cookies","These cookies are just adorable, and kind of irresistible. They're tree-shaped (the name kind of gave that away, 
we know) biscuits, filled with milk chocolate. Realistically, we could have stopped there, because, chocolate-
filled biscuits. But if we've learned anything throughout our years of holiday season product development, it's 
this: why do, when you can overdo? And so, it is in the spirit of overdoing that we present Trader Joe's Decked 
Out Tree Cookies.

Those aforementioned chocolate-filled, tree-shaped biscuits are decorated with creamy, white (dare we say 
snow-like?) icing, and then dusted with red and white sprinkles. They're sweet and toothsome, quite festive and 
fun to look at, and, at about 30¢ per cookie, an affordable way to liven up your holiday cookie platter without 
going to the effort of mixing, baking and decorating. We're selling each 7.05 ounce box of eight Decked Out 
Tree Cookies for $2.49, a really great value you'll find only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, and only while

chocolate-enrobed cocoa cream wafers to shortbreads dipped in decadent chocolate. The collection can be 
found in its familiar red tin, but now our cookies are drizzled, dipped and otherwise delightfully enhanced by 
Belgian chocolate. Chocolate makes everything tastier.

so that the accompanying crackers can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. But our crack team of cracker buyers 
makes it their mission to ensure no cheese or cured meat is left to fend for itself, and for the 2021 holiday 
season they've brought us a truly dynamic Entertaining Cracker Duo - all the way from Australia! - that's 
ready to make a statement on your next cheese board.

The cheese and black pepper Wafer Crackers in this box are delightfully crispy and make excellent vehicles for 
dipping as well as a base for DIY holiday appetizers, like creme fraîche with salmon & dill; the onion-forward, 
flax seed-studded Cracker Crisps are sturdy and slightly sweet, super for serving alongside a charcuterie plate, 
or a nutty, aged cheese and a drizzle of your favorite TJ's honey. The seven-ounce box in which these Crackers 
are housed is decidedly smaller than our other entertaining cracker offerings, making this Duo ideal for a 
smaller gathering or a midweek cheese-plate-for-dinner situation.

Our supplier (who also makes our trufflized potato chips) starts with an heirloom variety of mushroom 
kernel popcorn and pops it in sunflower oil. These kernels-with their consistent, round shape-are great for 
delivering seasonings. Each batch of popped corn is dusted with a decadent seasoning imported from Italy and 
composed of Italian white truffles and French sea salt. Compared to black summer truffles, white truffles have

for snacking: Trader Joe's Step Up to the Bar Snack Mix [sku 61167]. This year, we're taking a bold new step with 
the introduction of Trader Joe's Stepping It Up Spicy Snack Bar Mix, which adds a spicy spin to our original 
version's sweet-savory synthesis. This snack mix remix includes sweet jalapeño pretzel pieces, spicy cheese 
corn sticks, spiced chile almonds, and crispy chile lemon corn nuggets. We find its compostion to be rather 
harmonious, balanced with a variety of flavors, textures, and an enticing level of heat that makes it an ideal 
companion to a frosty glass of beer. 

In addition to taking the steps to ensure its mix of savory, sweet, and spicy is just right, we've also taken the 
extra step of making sure it's an excellent value: for a limited time, we're selling 11.5-ounce canisters of  Trader

"061167","Step Up to the Snack Bar Mix","One of the most enjoyable ways to snack is on a combination of contrasting flavors. There's just something 
irresistible about the overlap of sweet & salty that keeps hungry hands returning to the bowl. Add a little tang 
or spice to the mix, and you only increase the addictive component. Trader Joe's Step Up to the Snack Bar Mix 
is a snacktime study in contrasting flavors-and accordingly, a super tasty, keep-coming-back kind of snack.

The base of the Mix is savory, featuring salted corn chips with flaxseeds, TJ's own Cheddar Rocket Crackers 
[sku 99083], and chili-lemon corn sticks-which also lend the Mix a slight, tangy kick. Then, we add a trio of 
honeyed treats represent the sweeter side of snacking: honey roasted peanuts, honey roasted sesame sticks, and 
honey mustard pretzel bits. 

Beyond flavor, our Step Up to the Snack Bar Mix is visually appealing, too, with varied colors and textures, 
lending itself to presentation in your favorite bowl at your next party's cocktail hour. You may also find yourself 
making up occasions to attack this snack¿ a mid-afternoon handful to make it through until mealtime... in 
traffic on the way home from work¿ on the porch at sunset...

Trader Joe's Step Up to the Snack Bar Mix comes in a handy-dandy, presentable 12-ounce tub with a reclosable

"072617","Candied Pecans","The venerable pecan, of pie fame, likely grew wild for centuries before being domesticated and cultivated as a 
major agricultural crop. Today, the United States produces hundreds of thousands of tons of pecans annually-
Trader Joe's certainly doesn't sell all of them, but we do move a plethora of pecans through our doors each 
year. We sell raw pecans, roasted pecans, whole pecans, pieces of pecans... And, these, the pecans de resistance, 
Candied Pecans.

Trader Joe's Candied Pecans begin as high quality pecan halves, grown in the U.S.A. They're roasted with a 
bit of canola oil, coated in powdered sugar while they're still hot, then salted. They're not too sweet and not too 
salty; their balance is what makes them so craveable. Our recommendation: Buy two bags at a time; you can 
thank us later.

"068840","Organic Taralli and Friends Crackers","We're quite taken with Taralli. A traditional wintertime snack that dates all the way back to the 15th century,  
you could consider them to be the Southern Italian cousins to the mini-pretzel: they're crunchy, bready, and 
splendidly savory, with a distinctive curlicue shape. Charming in their simplicity, they have a satisfying, 
breadstick-like texture, and mild, but habit-forming, flavor profile that's accented by just a touch of olive oil and 
salt. And, like any true Italian treat, they make an excellent companion to wine - many Taralli enthusiasts like 
to dunk them directly in their vino before snacking, in fact. We're so taken, in fact, that we took some organic 
Taralli, combined them with a number of similarly organic, crunchy, wine-friendly crackers, and placed them 
in our Organic Taralli and Friends assortment, just for the holidays. 

Inside each bag, you'll find the afore-mentioned ring-shaped Taralli, along with multigrain rustichelle, savory, 
onion-flavored tocchetti, and twisty, crumbly trecce. All four go great with wine, cheeses, antipasti, or anything 
else that can use a bit of textural pop, and all four will add some visual flare to any hors d'oeuvre spread, to 
boot. We particularly like to keep a bowl on hand for holiday gatherings, where they can truly shine as an 
accompaniment to pre-meal cocktails or post-dinner mixing and mingling.

"070907","Organic Dried & Pitted Deglet Noor Dates","We sell a whole lot of dates in our stores, the vast majority of which are of the Medjool variety. However, there's 
a whole wide world of dates out there, representing a vast spectrum of color, flavor, and texture: varieties like 
golden Barhi dates, nutty Zahidi dates, and super-soft Mazafati dates are some notable examples. For our latest 
foray into the date world, we've chosen Deglet Noor Dates, a variety that's slightly less sweet and just a touch 
firmer than a typical Medjool. As Trader Joe's Organic Dried & Pitted Deglet Noor Dates ably demonstrate, 
this milder flavor and toothsome texture make them perfect for all sorts of sweet, savory, or even just snack-
based situations.

Organically grown in California, our supplier pits each Date prior to packing, which both makes snacking 
easier, and leaves a convenient cavity, within which you can stuff cream cheese, blue cheese, chevre, or even 
bits of bacon or prosciutto. Aside from the implications for appetizers this creates, these Dates are also great for 
using in baking, incorporating into sauces, or chopping up and mixing into salads. For a nice boost of energy, 
try taking a handful with you, along with some walnuts, almonds, or cashews, the next time you go on a hike.

traditional-pie-style fillings. There are four flavors-two of each kind in the package-designed to remind 
you of your holiday favorites: Apple Pie (caramel apple cinnamon filling with milk & white chocolate shell); 
Pumpkin Pie (cranberry ginger cinnamon filling with milk & dark chocolate shell); Pecan Caramel Pie (salted 
caramel pecan filling with milk & dark chocolate shell); and Silk Mousse Pie (chocolate and vanilla crème filling 
with milk & white chocolate shell). Additionally, the top of each slice has been decorated by hand, with biscuit 
crumbs, milk chocolate pieces, caramelized pecan nuts, and brownie cookie crumbs, respectively.

These Pie Truffles are charming on a dessert tray, or as a marvelously meta decoration for a full-sized pie slice.

cranberry ginger cinnamon flavored Truffle? Or how about a slice of homemade apple pie with the caramel

straightaway. Another kaizen of this Cookie Decorating Kit? The whole caboodle will cost you two dollars less 
than our previously offered Turkey Kit!

"092797","Milk Chocolate Advent Calendar","Every year, Trader Joe's Advent Calendars entice children and adults alike to countdown December days. The colorful, 
innovative designs, and creatively shaped chocolates behind every window kindle the holiday mood. 

Made for us by a French-Canadian chocolatier in Quebec, our Advent Calendars' chocolates have 3.5% more cocoa 
butter than the versions we carried pre-2015. The recipe incorporates 51% sugar, 21% cocoa butter, 13% unsweetened 
chocolate, 11.5% whole milk powder, 2.5% nonfat dry milk, and natural vanilla. (Compare this with the 2014 recipe: 
50.5% sugar, 17.5% cocoa butter, 17.5% whole milk powder, 14% unsweetened chocolate, and natural vanilla.) Numbers 
and percentages aside, what this really adds up to is a smoother, more chocolate-y taste.

We also increased the variety of seasonal shapes in 2015. Now, the eager calendar-watcher opens each window to reveal 
one of 24 unique, unrepeated shapes. And we're offering five different Calendar designs for the 2018 Christmas season. 
Choose your favorite, or collect all five! And here's one thing that hasn't changed: the price. Our Chocolate Advent

"063977","Nuts About Rosemary Mix","Every good party needs a good bar mix. While you may not have a literal bar set up at your to-do, if you're 
serving beverages of any kind - alcoholic or no - your guests will want some type of snack they can just grab 
by the handful. To that end, last year, we introduced Step Up To The Bar Snack Mix to, honestly, tremendous 
applause. Of course we knew it was good going in (that's why we brought it in, silly), but we were truly surprised 
by the level of excitement the mix generated. It got us thinking¿ a savory mix made entirely of nuts¿ and we 
were on a mission. 

That mission led to the creation of this year's mega mix, Trader Joe's Nuts About Rosemary Mix. As 
intended, this one's all about the nuts. Inside the canister are copious quantities of roasted almonds, 
cashews, hazelnuts (aka Filberts), and pecans, blended with a rosemary-sea salt blend and spiked with just a 
touch of sugar (when we say just a touch, we mean less than one gram of added sugar per serving). This is 
the kind of Mix you can add to a cheese tray at an elegant soirée one night, and enjoy by the handful during a 
football game the next. No matter the party occasion, this Mix  presents a delicious opportunity to mix things 
up a bit. In case gift-giving is on your mind, it's worth noting that it also makes an excellent addition to a gift 
basket for a favorite foodie.

We're selling each 12 ounce canister of Nuts About Rosemary Mix for $6.99, while they last, through

"071089","Graham Cracker Squares","Let's get things fair and square for just a moment: the humble graham cracker is overdue for appreciation. 
With is subtle, cookie-like sweetness and gratifying, cracker-like crumbliness, graham crackers have more 
than earned a solid reputation for being a dependably delicious snack and dessert ingredient. And now, in 
honor of graham crackers' grand acheivement, we offer Trader Joe's Graham Cracker Squares, an assemblage 
of perfectly baked, lightly honey-flavored Graham Crackers cut into individual squares for easy snacking, 
crumbling, and enjoying in general.

Our Graham Cracker Squares are classically crisp in texture, with a pleasant, resounding snap when broken 
into pieces. They make for an excellent afternoon snack for youngsters and the young-at-heart, and their 
delicate, toasty sweetness make them ideal for crumbling over yogurt or ice cream, or even blitzing in a food 
processor for use in pie crusts or streusels. And that's before we get to their real starring turn, as the foundation 
for a gooey, scrumptious s'more: put these together with a freshly toasted Marshmallows [sku 56661] and a Milk 
Chocolate Truffle Bar [sku 70558], and we're talking about some serious appreciation, there.

"072676","Organic Naan Crackers","One of our favorite things about our Tandoori Naan [sku 77677] is its vehicular versatility. Whether it's sweeping 
up the last bits of curry after a meal, scooping up chutney or garlic pickle, or even serving as an impromptu 
wrap, naan has an uncanny ability to literally carry all kinds of eating experiences. We were so inspired by its 
capabilities of conveyance, in fact, that we used it as the guiding inspiration for Trader Joe's Organic Naan 
Crackers. Shaped and flavored like buttery, fresh-from-the-oven naan, these Crackers trade the soft and fluffy 
texture of their namesake counterparts for a crisp, satisfying crunch that pairs perfectly with cheeses, hummus, 
or anything else that might need a lift from your plate to your lips.

Our supplier carefully crafts each Organic Naan Cracker to resemble a miniaturized naan, complete with  
raised bubbles and browned edges. They make an excellent accessory to charcuterie boards and cheese plates, 
where their mild flavor and homey notes of ghee work together to accentuate more savory flavors. We personally 
like them best when paired with a creamy, richly aromatic dip, like a garlicky hummus or a quick, homemade 
raita. Carry on, Organic Naan Crackers, and on, and on!

Sour Jelly Beans pack a mouth-puckering punch of tartness in every chewy bite. They come in five flavors, 
including green apple, blue raspberry, lemon, tangerine, and cranberry, which each deliver just enough fruity 
sweetness to accentuate their accompanying jolt of sour. It can be a bit of a shock to the system, but as those of 
us with a sour tooth know, it's often the sour notes that make life sweet.

In addition to being a superb anytime treat, these gluten-free, kosher (pareve) Sour Jelly Beans make an ideal 
movie snack, especially when paired with salted popcorn or mixed with regular jelly beans for a bit of variety. 
Their size and bold, natural colors also make them a great option for decorating cookies, cakes, and other

yet to experience or put a name to this phenomenon, a snackcident occurs when you open a bag of tasty Trader Joe's 
snacks with the intention of enjoying just one handful, only to find yourself with an empty bag in your hands a short 
while later). With their addictive crunch and salty, nutty flavor, a bag of Bamba falls squarely into the snackcident-
prone category-and the latest Bamba-based addition to our snack shelves is sure to cause cravings and tingle taste 
buds with abandon.
 
Trader Joe's Bamba with Hazelnut Crème Filling is the same beloved, golden-hued, delicately crunchy, peanutty 
corn snack from our regular Bamba bags, this time filled with a smooth, hazelnut crème filling. As the story goes, 
the people of Israel (where Bamba originated) were dunking their addictively crunchy & salty Bamba in creamy 
hazelnut spread, and cleverly suggested putting the spread inside the Bamba to allow for ingenious, expert-level 
snack enjoyment, without the mess. Our Buyer had one taste, and knew this miraculous marriage of sweet & salty 
goodness was a snackcident waiting to happen-one you can now find at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

crunchy Wafer Cookies - carefully crafted by experienced bakers into the shape of a conductor's baton - 
are filled with a soft, sweet, pumpkin-flavored cream spiced with a blend of classic pumpkin-pie spices, like 
cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove powders. Each Baton is about six to seven inches long, giving you over 
half a foot of crunch & cream in every Cookie. They're simply delightful on their own, but we also like to dip 
them in a hot cup of Autumn Maple Coffee [sku 66148] or cocoa.

Ladies and gentlemen, raise the Baton and start the band, because we're selling each five-ounce canister

"066056","Maple & Sea Salt Kettle Corn","If plain popcorn with a little salt and butter is a snack that really satisfies, then kettle corn is next level with the 
addition of lightly caramelized sugar. Is there a next, NEXT level in popcorn snacking? We think there is, and 
we think it's called Trader Joe's Maple & Sea Salt Kettle Corn.

This fresh for fall snack is popped in coconut oil and high oleic sunflower oil, seasoned with sea salt, and 
sweetened with a light maple-sugar glaze. (Maple sugar is what is left when all the water is boiled out of the sap 
of a sugar maple tree. Could there be anything more fallish than that?)

Maple & Sea Salt Kettle Corn with its light crunch, maple-y sweetness, and touch of salt, is a wonderful snack, 
as-is. However, it can also bring some new excitement to autumnal lunch boxes. And, it makes a great seasonal 
party treat when mixed with Candy Coated Peanuts [sku 63632].

These Maple Almonds are perfectly palate-pleasing by the handful, and equally excellent sprinkled atop a bowl

This year, however, we've got a bonafide treat for you: Trader Joe's Spooky Bats & Cats Sour Gummy Candies. 

Truth be told, our cat and bat-shaped Sour Gummy Candies aren't much of a fright at all - they're made with 
natural flavors and plant-sourced colors, and we don't use any gelatin. Luckily, what they lack in scare-power, 
they more than make up for in scrumptiousness. Toss a pouch in your ghost-for-a-night's trick-or-treat bag.

A crispy, crunchy maple bar of sorts, these twice-baked, buttery cookies offer sturdy structure for dunking and 
dipping, not to mention portability. Tender chopped walnuts add a nutty crunch, while natural maple flavor 
and brown sugar bring sweetness and warmth. A drizzle of white icing further amps up the sweetness - these 
are cookies, after all - so this Biscotti looks nearly as good as it tastes, whether you enjoy it with a spot of tea, 
a robust espresso, a cozy cup of cocoa, or a mug of good, old-fashioned Pumpkin Spice Coffee [sku 97234].

What is known is that after Hansel got caught ""nibble, nibble, gnaw[ing]¿""  at the old woman's roof, gingerbread 
house-making skyrocketed to new heights, especially around the holidays.

Since Halloween now serves as a kick-off to the entire holiday season, and the delightfully ghoulish celebration 
is marked by elaborate decorations of the hearth, as well as the self, we thought a Haunted House Cookie Kit 
befit the occasion. But since we're not quite into ""official"" gingerbread season yet, we decided to make this a 
Haunted House Chocolate Cookie Kit instead.

Given the fact the ""original"" edible, gingerbread abode was haunted by a wicked witch, we'd dare to say that 
calling it a Haunted  House is superfluous. But with decorations like bats, skeletons, pumpkins and black cats, 
the name is quite descriptive. 

Absolutely enchanting, this prefab., ready-to-assemble Haunted House is made for us by dedicated gingerbread 
house kit innovators in Canada. The attention to character and detail is unparalleled, as are the ingredients used 
to make them. (The spooky colors used in the icing and the candies, for example, come from naturally available 
ingredients like paprika, turmeric, beet root, black currant, carrot, pumpkin, hibiscus, spirulina, etc...). Every 
piece comes prepared for your imaginings, however grim they may be.

We're selling each 39-ounce, limited-quantity Haunted House Chocolate Cookie Kits for $7.99 each-and,

the ideal cracker for Pumpkin Season soirées.  Like their fruit-herb-cracker-combo-cousins, these are loaf-
shaped crackers baked to an incredibly crispy finish.  They stand on their own, though, when it comes to 
flavor.  They're made with buttermilk and real pumpkin - which gives them a substantially more dense 
texture than their forebears - flax seeds, rolled oats, liberal amounts of tart, dried cranberries, and just the 
right amount of thyme and sage. We worked on the spice balance for quite a while, and we think we got it 
just right.

Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps are excellent with all kinds of dips and cheeses, and flavorful enough to enjoy 
unadorned.  Try them with our Apple Pie Goat Cheese Log for a mash-up of seasonal flavors you won't

with some kind of sweet cream. On one visit to the region, we encountered Sfogliette [sfow-lee-EH-tee], a snack 
cracker with similar delicate attributes to its pastry relative, but with a savory profile. This led directly to the 
creation of Trader Joe's Rosemary Sfogliette.

Our Italian supplier makes thin, hexagonal biscuits using wheat and rice flours, along with a combination of 
olive and sunflower oils. The crackers are seasoned with dried rosemary & sea salt and baked until they possess 
the ideal crunch. They're thin and crisp, but not overly fragile. And they present the wonderful aroma and 
flavors of rosemary and olive oil.

"000691","Peanut Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets","There are certain products that come to mind when people talk about Trader Joe's. We won't list them because, 
really, everyone has his or her own list. We know how it goes. It does seem, though, that right up there near the 
top of everyone's lists are Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels.  

These iconic nuggets ranked in the top ten when we asked our own Captains (that's ""Manager,"" to us) for their 
favorites. Judging from the number of bags that fly through our stores (figurative flying; the bags are not meant 
to be airborne), the love is near-universal. Made for us in Pennsylvania (properly prodigious pretzel pedigree), 
each real-peanut-butter-filled pretzel nugget is coated with coarse salt, and delivers crunchy and creamy and 
salty. They're great party nibbles with cocktails or beer, juice or even sparkling water, and they make satisfying 
snacks for lunchboxes or after-school. 

There's a whole pound of these delicious little gems in each bag, and we're selling each bag for $2.99. Like 
everything at Trader Joe's, this is no sale price; it's our everyday price that you'll find in every Trader Joe's, every

"071946","Carolina Gold Style BBQ Ridge Cut Potato Chips","Carolina Gold Barbecue Sauce [sku 51438], also known as CGBS,  is a customer favorite here at Trader Joe's. Once 
only available seasonally, it now graces our grocery shelves all year long. Unlike typical tomato-based barbecue 
sauces, this one has a distinctively tangy mustard base that takes its cues from classic Carolina barbecue. Among 
its many uses, it shines as a dipping sauce for fries, tots, and roasted potatoes. And so it occurred to us¿ potato 
chips! Not content to simply dip our chips in the stuff, we embarked on a mission to do for chips what CGBS has 
already done for barbecue. And so, friends, Romans, countrymen¿ behold Trader Joe's Carolina Gold Style 
BBQ Flavored Ridge Cut Potato Chips! 

Like the sauce from whence they draw their moniker, these chips are tangy, sweet, and deliver just a bit of a smoky 
kick. We tried a number of variations in our research (someone had to do it!), and unanimously concluded that 
this thick, ridged cut of the potatoes allows for maximum flavor delivery-no dipping required! For a limited 
time, you can find seven-ounce bags of Carolina Gold Style BBQ Flavored Ridge Cut Potato Chips hanging out 
on the shelves of our snack aisle. Trust us: nothing could be finer!

"053273","Fig & Olive Crisps","Figs are fruity, honey-like, and intensely sweet. Olives are briny, savory, and can be a little fruity, too. For years, 
food lovers have made fast culinary companions of this pair. Figs and Olives have been pulverized together in 
tapenades, sliced fresh on hors d'oeuvre platters, and stewed with meat for a rich potage. We've chosen to take 
these two complimentary tastes and present them inside a crispy cracker.

Trader Joe's Fig & Olive Crisps are like miniature, toasted, bread-slices. They've got a healthy crunch, en-
hanced by flax, sesame, and sunflower seeds. Dried Mission figs from California and brined Kalamata olives 
from Greece are evenly distributed throughout the crisps, offering once again that captivating, sweet and 
savory contrast. Finished with a hint of sea salt, our Fig & Olive Crisps are perfect for eating out of the box 
and out of your hand.

Their sturdy shape welcomes dipping in hummus, and is ready for the spread of a soft cheese. Our Chèvre with 
Honey [sku 98592] would be perfect. Notch up the flavor complexity with a spread of one of our numerous nut 
butters. Try our Creamy Salted Cashew Butter [sku 52294]. Or, throwing all caution to the wind, slather some 
tapenade on top-the fig and olive kind, of course!

Like our already popular Rosemary Raisin Crisps [sku 95281], Fig & Olive Crisps come in a 5.3-ounce box, 
available now for $3.99. Elsewhere, you'd pay a dollar more (or more!) for such a fantastic, artisanal snack.

Trader Joe's Crispy Crunchy Champignon Mushroom Snack is made using Champignon mushrooms (the 
white kind) grown in Kennett Square-a borough of Chester County, PA that has been known to produce over 
500 million pounds of mushrooms annually. That's around half the total United States crop! 

The mushrooms are thick-cut, vacuum fried with sunflower oil, and salted, to produce a bite-sized Mushroom 
Snack that is crispy, crunchy, and loaded with savory, subtly sweet, 'shroom flavor. If your snack-routine of

They owe their crisp crunchiness to the main ingredients-pea flour and chickpea flour-and to how our snack 
supplier bakes them until they reach their satisfying texture. A little sea salt complements the mild, ""beany"" 
flavor, and completes the flavor profile to make Trader Joe's Crisp Crunchy Crisps a crave-able snack, right 
out of the bag.

But if you are seeking even more flavor, you'll find these vegan, gluten free, kosher Crisps are down with the

flavor-combination of chocolate and peanut butter. And they do it in the form of our eponymous sandwich 
cookies. It's hard to imagine anything better!
 
Instead of vanilla crème between the biscuits, these two cocoa-flavored cookies are sandwiched around creamy 
peanut butter. We could have stopped there... but we didn't. Next, we doubled-down on those flavors by entirely 
enrobing these Joe Joe's in a creamy peanut-butter coating and finishing with a sweet, chocolatey drizzle.

and agriculturally bountiful Central Valley.

Trader Joe's Raw Almonds are of the supreme grade, nonpareil variety. French for ""no equal"", nonpareil

"054683","Fig Cookies","Newton's three laws of motion can more or less be explained as inertia (objects at rest or in movement will 
remain in those states unless acted upon by outside force), acceleration (greater mass requires greater force to 
cause acceleration), and for every action there is an equal an opposite reaction. 

How do these laws relate to Trader Joe's Fig Bites made with Turkish Figs? We're glad you asked. These cookies, 
made for us in the American Midwest, will absolutely remain in their package until your hand comes in from 
the outside and moves them. It is absolutely true that it takes more force (strength) to lift an entire ten-ounce 
package than it does to lift a single Fig Bite. 

And that third law? We think that means when you place a Fig Bite into your mouth, a signal is sent from your 
taste buds to your brain and back into your hand, forcing another cookie to be lifted and brought to your mouth. 
Perhaps that's equal but not opposite? Whatever it is, we think Newton would approve of these cookies made with 
soft cookie dough surrounding a chewy, sweet, figgy center.

He would probably also like our price of $1.99 for each ten-ounce package, because, really, who doesn't love a 
great value?

"091749","Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt","There was a time, in the not-so-distant past (yet sometimes it feels like a lifetime ago), that we sold quite a 
number of potato chips in bags bearing national brand names. Whatever were we thinking? In fact, at one stage, 
we offered two entirely different rippled, ridge cut potato chips with the same flavor profile. Why would we 
do such a thing? Well, we remedied that situation by doing what we do-we held a blind tasting to determine 
which was best, and the winner got a packaging facelift. Actually, the winner got a packaging face transplant-it 
won its way into the world of Trader Joe's private label, and has been winning fans ever since. 

Trader Joe's Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt were the winners then, and they remain winners today. 
They're thick slices of Arizona and Minnesota grown potatoes, cooked in small batches in expeller pressed 
sunflower oil, then lightly salted. They're simple chips, with three simple ingredients, and they're simply 
delicious. On their own, dipped in virtually any dip, or even crushed and used as a breading for chicken (trust 
us here: yum!), these Chips are the real deal. 

One of the benefits of the Trader Joe's label versus a national brand label is we're able to negotiate better pricing 
when we package products in our label. That holds true here. Have you shopped for chips elsewhere? They're 
crazy expensive! But ours aren't. We're selling Trader Joe's Ridge Cut Potato Chips with Sea Salt in a 16-ounce 
bag for $2.99, every day.

"071945","Strawberry & Jalapeño Crisps","If we've learned one thing as a purveyor of snacks (and we think we've learned at least a few things) it's that 
some of the most unlikely pairings produce the most wonderful results. For instance, you wouldn't necessarily 
think to team up two flavors as disparate as strawberries and jalapeño peppers outside of, say, a margarita. But 
when you put them together inside a nutty, consummately crispy cracker, as we've done with our summer-
seasonal Trader Joe's Strawberry & Jalapeño Crisps, you've got something truly transcendent.

Enjoying each Crisp is a journey in itself, starting with the delectable crunch of the initial bite. That's followed 
shortly by the jammy sweetness of the dried strawberry, which in turn is tempered by the savory nature of the 
buttermilk cracker base and the sunflower seeds that can be found throughout. Just as you're done processing that 
pleasant pairing, you're struck, moderately at first, by the heat of the dried jalapeño. As you  continue to snack on 
these Crisps, preferably with a nice, creamy dip or a savory cheese like our Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923], that 
heat continues to build into a crescendo that must be tasted to be believed. Be sure to grab a box while you can, 
though - Trader Joe's Strawberry & Jalapeño Crisps are only available during the summer months.

Popcorn kernels are popped in a blend of coconut and sunflower oils, and then, true to their kettle corn roots, 
they're lightly coated with sugar and salt. Along the way, they're treated to both lime and Key Lime flavors, 
adding a layer of vibrancy we've never before tasted in a Kettle Popcorn. Every crunchy bite is sweet, salty, tart, 
and tangy. Think of it as a gluten free, kosher (pareve) trip to the tropics in every 5.5 ounce bag. Or, at the very 
least, a journey away from ordinary snacking. But don't think too long; you'll want to buy a bag or two while

was awaiting a flight in a Thai airport when she noticed a nutty snack with a lime-chile-lemongrass flavor blend. 
Immediately hooked on the combination, she set about developing a version to offer at Trader Joe's. The tasting 
panel was equally enamored, and Thai Lime & Chili Cashews quickly became a TJ's staple. You could say, then, 
that this story goes from soup to nuts. 
 
Every batch of Trader Joe's Thai Lime & Chili Cashews begins with a particular variety of lime, singular to 
Thailand, that has an almost perfume-y flavor. The cashews are, of course, crunchy; slices of tiny red and green 
chiles add a burst of flavor and a good deal of heat; and the vibrant, almost-otherworldly flavor of lemongrass 
rounds out the picture. We're pretty sure the grocer down the street doesn't have snacks like this one - or stories

a rut, and you have a hankering to heed the call to heretofore unheard of flavor combinations, this popcorn is 
your ticket to taste bud tantalization. 

Its name is not just a clever play on words-it's also an apt description of this dill pickle flavored popcorn. Using 
the largest mushroom popcorn kernels they can find, our supplier air pops the corn and tosses it with a tart, 
pucker-producing dill pickle seasoning. The flavors are bold, completely fresh, and prodigiously pickle-y. With 
every handful of Popcorn in a Pickle, you can treat yourself to the pucker-y taste of dill pickles and the salty 
crunch of popcorn. 

We've brought this specially crafted popcorn in to our stores just for the summer months, so if it's a pickle you

one we thought, ""These are delish¿ why do we only have one flavor?"" We challenged our supplier - a family-
owned candy business that's been making sweets for more than 130 years - to bring us another irresistible 
flavor. After tasting a bunch, we found ourselves continually going back to the watermelon flavor, and Trader 
Joe's Dark Chocolate Watermelon Sticks were born.

These are made with the same basic recipe used in the original Orange version, but with watermelon flavor. 
The dark chocolate is firm enough to help the Sticks hold their shape, and the filling is soft but not gooey. The 
vibrant flavor will keep you coming back for Stick after Stick after Stick. Unlike their citrusy cousins, Dark 
Chocolate Watermelon Sticks are only available for a limited time, so if watermelon is your wish for your

(presumably great) backyard. And now, it's an assemblage of summer sensations in the form of Trader Joe's 
Patio Potato Chips.

In the spirit of the backyard patio, that site of many a midsummer soirée, this greatest hits collection of picnic-
ready ridged Potato Chips is comprised of four distinct flavors: Sea Salt & Vinegar, Delicious Dill, Homestyle 
Ketchup, and Smokin' Sweet BBQ. Separately, each chip is a exquisitely evocative simulacrum of hearty backyard 
cuisine, but together, they're a symphony, greater than the sum of their summery parts: the sweetness of the 
Homestyle Ketchup plays off the delightfully sour edge of the Sea Salt & Vinegar, while the classic Smokin' 
Sweet BBQ harmonizes perfectly with the savory and aromatic Delicious Dill. All told, all four together conjure 
the taste of a glorious barbecued hamburger. Not bad for a handful of potato chips, eh?

While supplies last, we're selling six ounce bags of Trader Joe's Patio Potato Chips for $2.29. You'll find them 
in our snack aisle.

"038985","Salted White Corn Tortilla Chips","So much depends upon the quality of a Tortilla Chip. A salsa-scooping experience requires a chip that's crispy, 
but sturdy. Nachos need chips that's nice and thin, but can still stack ingredients well. Chilaquiles call for chips 
that are flavorful, but not overbearing. It's with these weighty factors in mind that we developed Trader Joe's 
Salted Tortilla Chips, a two-pound bag of dependably delicious salted Tortilla Chip rounds made from stone 
ground white corn.

Created with utiltiy in mind, these Chips' round shape give them a real edge (metaphorically speaking) when 
paired with salsas, guacamole, hummus, Creamy Artichoke & Spinach Dip [sku 78032], or any other dip you 
can care to name. Along with their circular nature, their crispy texture and salty, toasty flavor make them 
a great option for use in nachos, chilaquiles, or any other dish that calls for Tortilla Chips in a structural 
capacity, And lastly, their undeniable value makes them a true force to be reckoned with in the snack aisle: 
We're selling 32-ounce (2 lbs) bags of Salted Tortilla Chips for $3.49*, every day.

"070915","Chips in a Pickle","Let's put it plainly: Trader Joe's has proudly packed a peck of pickles into these pouches of potato chips. That's 
a bit of a tongue-twister, but it's nothing compared to the tongue-twisting taste of Trader Joe's Chips In A 
Pickle, a fantastically flavorful snack that combines the resounding crunch of a kettle-cooked potato chip 
with the tangy tartness and aromatic herbaceousness of a deli-style dill pickle. In the proud tradition of our 
summertime staple Popcorn in a Pickle [sku 55428], Trader Joe's Chips In A Pickle are bold, flavorful, and in 
their own way, surprisingly refreshing.

While they certainly make a superb standalone snack, Chips In A Pickle are truly at their peak when paired 
up with a highly-stacked sandwich, fully dressed burger, or freshly grilled hot dog. They also make a capital 
companion to light, easy-drinking ales or crisp, tangy white wines, like our Espiral Vinho Verde [sku 47536]. 
For satisfying crunch, tantalizing tanginess, and distinctly delicious dose of dill, put Trader Joe's Chips In A

"069556","Fruity Chewy Candy","We sell a wide variety of chocolate, from candy bars to covered coffee beans-and everything in between. But, 
lately, we've been receiving requests for more non-chocolate candies. Trader Joe's Fruity Chewy Candy meets 
this request with flying colors, specifically: pink, red, magenta, orange, and yellow! These vibrant colors are 
naturally derived only from fruit and vegetable juices. 

Of course, the Fruity flavors are likely of even more interest than the colors, and this Candy is bursting with 
natural flavors, including: strawberry (pink), cherry (red), raspberry (magenta), orange, and lemon (yellow). 
(A comparable chewy, fruity candy on the market uses artificial flavors and artificial colors.) 

Since you brought it up¿ our Fruity Chewy Candy also differs in that it is made with coconut oil instead of 
palm oil, and it is completely gelatin-free.

"058373","Bamba Peanut Snacks","Science has proven that elephants have better memories than most of their wild animal counterparts, hence 
the saying, ""An elephant never forgets..."" With science as our guide, we can say with certainty that after sampling 
a trunk-ful, an elephant would truly never forget Trader Joe's Bamba Peanut Snacks. Small and unassuming 
(much like peanuts themselves), Bamba Peanut Snacks are light, crunchy, and positively bursting with rich, 
peanut flavor. It's a snack unlike any other, and once you give them a try, even non-elephant types like yourself 
are sure to have Bamba on the brain. 

Made for us in Israel, where Bamba is far and away the best-selling snack in the country, Trader Joe's Bamba 
Peanut Snacks contain just four, simple ingredients: corn grits, peanut paste, palm oil, and salt. First, the corn 
grits are ""popped"" under high pressure, turning them into long rope-like lines of white, puffed, unflavored 
""Bamba."" Next, the Bamba is cut into peanut-sized nuggets and air-baked for 20 seconds in a drying chamber, 
which gives it an even crispier texture. Finally, the Bamba is moved into large, rotating drums, where they 
are coated with hot, liquid peanut butter (made from peanut paste, palm oil, and salt). The resulting snack is 
crunchy, airy, peanutty and highly craveable-kind of like a cheese puff without the cheese.

Not only is Bamba is tricky to find in general (most U.S. grocers don't carry the stuff), but it's darn near 
impossible to find it at a price better than ours-because we're selling each 3.5-ounce bag of Trader Joe's 
Bamba Peanut Snacks for just 99 cents. That's practically peanuts! Pass the Bamba, please...

licorice plant, a perennial herb, belongs to the pea family. There are 20 different species of the plant that grow

with molasses, licorice root extract, and natural flavor from aniseed oil. The combination of both licorice 
extract and anise create the decidedly strong, ideal black licorice flavor-simultaneously sweet and herbal. To 
top it off, our licorice supplier developed the perfect method of cooking and cooling licorice, so the pieces are 
soft and stay soft without the use of preservatives.

"097232","Five Seed Almond Bars","The inspiration for these captivating cookies came from traditional Italian biscotti and a more modern take on 
granola bars. What we created from that inspiration unintentionally became an early trend setter in the ""breakfast 
cookie"" category. If you haven't yet partaken in Trader Joe's Five Seed Almond Bars, you definitely should, whether 
it's for breakfast, lunch, a snack, dinner, or even a dessert course with a glass of red wine.

Five Seed Almond Bars do indeed boast five seeds - flax, sesame, poppy, sunflower, and pumpkin - and almonds, yet 
their name doesn't tell their whole story. Their recipe also includes flour and an assortment of flavorful ingredients 
like oats, brown & white sugar, eggs, honey, and the almonds are seasoned with cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla. 
Baked to a consistency that's ideally situated between chewy and crunchy, they taste wholesome, like you baked 
them yourself.  And they are wholesome, real food. With 53mg of EPA & DHA Omega-3's, if you're going to do the 
cookies for breakfast thing, Five Seed Almond Bars are smart choices. With coffee or tea, crumbled into yogurt with 
fresh berries, or handheld, while you're busy doing all the other things you need to do in the morning.

We're selling each eight ounce bag of eight Five Seed Almond Bars for $3.99*. You'll find them with the cookies, 
of course.

"066400","Spicy Chakri Mix","In sanskrit, chakri literally means ""disc."" Snack-ily speaking, chakri are savory wheels made of extruded rice 
and chickpea flour dough that is spiraled into circles and fried until super crispy. In parts of India, there are 
entire stores devoted to snack mixes known as namkeen, which often contain chakri. You can even find some 
of these savory snacks in certain ethnic markets in the U.S. After experiencing namkeen and specifically chakri 
for ourselves in India, we decided to engage our top supplier of Indian meals to create a special version just for 
Trader Joe's.

In our Spicy Chakri Mix, the chickpea and rice flours are made into a traditional dough and similarly forced 
through a mold to make a spiny design. But, instead of spiraling this dough into discs, ours is cut into pieces 
then fried. The result is little sticks with that same crazy crunch as the spiraled version. We've added some 
textural interest and flavor contrast by adding peanuts and some fried curry leaves. The Mix is finally tossed in 
a moderately hot seasoning that includes red chili & jalapeño powders; fennel, coriander, mustard, & ajowan 
seeds; cumin, turmeric, and salt.

Trader Joe's Spicy Chakri Mix is ideally paired with an IPA or lager. Its savory flavor also goes very well with 
cubes of a mild, creamy cheese, such as Trader Joe's Double Cream Gouda [sku 96032].

more than 80% of the world's vanilla. Perhaps less famously, it's also home to some of the world's best chocolate, 
including the organic, heirloom, cacao beans used to craft Trader Joe's Organic 92% Dark Chocolate Bar. 

Our producer is a true bean-to-bar purveyor who starts with single-origin, heirloom cocoa beans that are 
organically grown by farmer-run cooperatives in the remote tropical forests of Madagascar. These special 
beans become bars in a modern, completely dairy-free factory, which is also in the country.

Chocolate lovers on our Tasting Panel delighted in this super-dark bar. At 92% cacao, it is definitely bold, 
however, it's not overly bitter. Instead, it has a pure and clean flavor that'll satisfy anyone who's looking for a

"067699","Amped-Up Almonds","To the naked eye, Trader Joe's Amped Up Almonds look suspiciously like our perennially popular Trader 
Joe's Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds [sku 56275]. This certainly makes sense, as each single-serve package 
of Amped Up Almonds also contains fine quality, U.S.-grown almonds enrobed in a dark chocolate coating. 
Similar, indeed. But, as their name would imply, these almonds are, well, Amped Up...

And to what, pray tell, may we attribute the amping-up of these particular Almonds? Why, the addition of 
pea protein, of course! Yes, that's right-we've added extra plant-based protein to the chocolatey coating, 
effectively increasing the product's protein content to 16g per 2.5-ounce bag! That's a big deal, especially when 
you consider that we've also reduced the total sugars to 14g per 2.5-ounce bag. (For reference, regular TJ's Dark 
Chocolate Almonds contain 8g of protein and 23g of total sugars per 2.5-ounce bag.)  Don't worry, though, we 
would never sacrifice taste or texture in the name of ""New Year; new me"" diet mentality. Nope-TJ's Amped 
Up Almonds are  still all that and a bag of¿ almonds!

Now, allow us to amp you up even further: we're selling each 2.5-ounce bag of Amped Up Almonds for $1.29,*

"068580","Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling","It goes without saying that chocolate and peanut butter are a deliciously dynamic duo, but what would you say 
if we told you we discovered something that transforms this dyad into a truly transcendant trio? Made for us 
by the same supplier as our celebrated Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie [sku 58527], Trader Joe's Chocolate 
Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling builds on the success of the first by forming a trifecta 
of rich milk chocolate, peanut butter, and crispy, crunchy wafer cookies. In mixing this tantalizing textural 
element in with the classic peanut butter and chocolate pair, we've created a candy-cookie hybrid that's so 
supremely satisfying that it must be tasted to be believed.

Each bite of a Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling starts with the sweetness of the 
milk chocolate, which then leads to the irresistable crunch of the light, airy wafer cookie. As soon as you make 
it through the satisfying snap of the cookie, your taste buds are met with lightly salted peanut butter to round it 
all out. It's a sweet experience in every sense of the word, and one that's only enhanced by the addition of a nice 
cup of coffee. Look for Chocolate Covered Wafer Cookie with Peanut Butter Filling, available in perfectly-

"068138","Chile Spiced Pineapple","As far as flavor combinations go, it's hard to beat sweet and spicy. There's a distinct dynamism to it, where the 
more you crank up the sweetness and the spiciness, the more interesting the flavor profile becomes. In the case 
of Trader Joe's Chile Spiced Pineapple, for example, we've taken something super sweet and succulent (dried 
rings of pineapple from Ghana) and paired it up with something truly spicy (a bold chili powder blend with 
cayenne and traditional chamoy powder), plus a little extra cane sugar and salt to make a snack that hits that 
special mix of sweet and heat that leaves you craving more with every bite.

Great for bringing along on road trips, keeping on hand at work, or simply enjoying at home, our Chile Spiced 
Pineapple is great for practically any snacking occasion. It's hot enough to warrant a pairing with a crisp, 
refreshing drink, like our Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu [sku 63261] or a bottle of Trader José Lager [sku 
96728], but not so hot that it will scare off  non-heat-seekers. Its hottest feature may yet be its price: we're selling

day. They'll be waiting for you in our dried fruit section.

"058406","Cornbread Crisps","One of the defining (and popular) features of cornbread is its fluffy, cake-y softness. Like a pillow, but made 
with cornmeal. Trader Joe's Cornbread Crisps don't have this signature fluffiness. But that's okay! As the name 
suggests, they're crispy, like chips. This is not a quality you're probably looking for in a pillow, but it is a great 
quality for a tasty, crunchy snack. It's is a new thing for cornbread, but we're pretty sure it'll only take one bite 
for you to be lying on your (real) pillow, dreaming of Crisps.

To make these Cornbread Crisps, we first make cornbread. Yes, the traditional, fluffy, flavorful cornbread. We 
use cornmeal, sunflower oil, and sugar for this step. Then, the cornbread is flattened and cut into small diamond 
shapes. Into the oven they go, and out come crunchy bites of cornbread. A touch of sea salt creates that perfect 
sweet-salty flavor balance that results in Crisps you won't want to put down.

Our Cornbread Crisps pair wonderfully anywhere you might want traditional cornbread. Crumble into bowls 
of soup. Butternut Squash [sku 55861], Turkey Chili [sku 47936], Black Bean [sku 98599], or Tomato Feta [sku 
58808], perhaps? But they've got more to offer, too! Make an appetizer with Cream Cheese [sku 12491], Turkey 
Chili [sku 47936], and Three Cheese Blend [sku 16541] and dip those Crisps like crazy. Of course, they also 
make an excellent anytime-you're-in-the-mood-for-cornbread snack.

We're selling each six-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Cornbread Crisps for $2.49, every day. That means on any day, 
at any time you so choose, you can be snacking on bites of crunchy cornbread. What a dream.

Our Banana & Nuts Trek Mix is a handy snack-not bread. Green Saba bananas from The Philippines (less 
sweet than ripe bananas) are sliced medium-thin and cooked in coconut oil to impart a potato-chip-like texture. 
The crunchy bananas are then mixed with two different kinds of whole nuts: cashews, which contribute their 
distinct, delicate, nutty flavor-and pecans, offering their softer, almost ""buttery"" flavor. 

All three are tossed in umami-rich seasonings, which include: coconut aminos, sea salt, paprika, turmeric, 
onion powder, and garlic powder. Taken together, all these flavors up the savory ante and are sure to bring this

"063485","Vanilla Flavored Baton Wafer Cookies","Trader Joe's Vanilla Flavored Baton Wafer Cookies are like music for your mouth. These delicate, crunchy, 
vanilla-flavored Wafer Cookies-each hand-rolled by experienced bakers into the shape of a conductor's baton, 
a la our much-loved classic Cocoa Batons [sku 93259]-are filled with soft, sweet, vanilla-flavored cream made 
with real, ground Indonesian vanilla beans. Each Baton Wafer Cookie is about six to seven inches long, giving 
you over half a foot of wafer crunch and vanilla cream in every Cookie. 

Our Vanilla Flavored Batons are delightful on their own, but we also like them dipped in coffee (or milk, tea, 
hot cocoa, etc.), or nestled in a big bowl of ice cream-we've tried them with all our favorite flavors, and we are 
pleased to report that these Batons complement each one flawlessly! 

Ladies and gentlemen, raise the Baton & and start the band, because we're selling each five-ounce canister 
of Trader Joe's Vanilla Flavored Baton Wafer Cookies (about a dozen Batons) for $1.99. You'll find them

"065411","Trail Mix Crackers","Trader Joe's Trail Mix Crackers include a whole bunch of savory, sweet, crunchy goodies you'd normally find 
in a trail or trek mix. Instead of being loose in the bag, though, those goodies are adroitly adhered to crisp, 
rectangular crackers. There are a couple of benefits to this configuration. One, every cheesy cracker contains an 
assortment of mung beans, sesame seeds, raisins, pumpkin seeds, and cashews - you get all the flavors in every 
bite. Two, the ease of eating can't be overstated. Rather than pouring out a handful of trail mix or filling a bowl, 
you need only reach in and grab a cracker. And then another. And another. Genius.

Our Buyer first encountered these crackers at a food show in Germany, and brought them to our Tasting Panel 
post haste. The Tasting Panel approved them, post taste, and now they're available in our snack section. Snack 
on them straight from the bag, schmear them with a bit of peanut butter, or pair with a favorite mild cheese to 
really amplify the savory. We're offering them in a 4.5 ounce bag, every day.

regular Scandinavian Swimmers [sku 55691].

These new Super Sour ones are made by the same expert candy supplier, using a similar process. (Have you 
seen the 'How It's Made' video?) Ingredients include cane sugar, tapioca syrup, and modified (non-gmo) 
cornstarch, with natural flavors and colors derived only from naturally available sources, such as fruit & veggie 
juices, spirulina, and annatto. Flavors include: red berry (starfish), huckleberry (dolphin), orange (tang fish), 
and strawberry (clam shell).

seeds, not nuts-but who calls them that?) Anyhow, when circumstances veer from the ordinary-say, when 
someone dusts those rich, flavorful pistachios with garlic & onion, they become quite nearly irresistible.

Irresistible is exactly how we'll describe Trader Joe's Garlic & Onion Pistachios. These are California-grown, 
in-shell pistachios, dry roasted and dusted with a robust blend of garlic, onion, and sea salt. Some folks like 
to pop whole pistachios into their mouths, shell and all, to make sure they get all the flavor. Other folks prefer 
to remove the shell first. We make no judgements, other than the only proper pistachio proclamation¿ yum!

"067385","Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars","We invite you to chew on this question for a bit: Why shouldn't a protein bar have all the same satisfying flavor 
and texture of a soft, chewy cereal bar? To that end, why shouldn't a cereal bar provide the same protein-
packed pick-me-up of a protein bar? And while we're on the subject, why shouldn't we combine them into 
one convenient, tasty treat? At Trader Joe's, we don't just ask the tough questions, we answer them. Today, our 
answer comes in the form of Trader Joe's Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars, a delightfully 
delicious and properly proteinaceous cereal bar made from a mix of peanuts, soy protein, and brown rice 
protein that's flavored with the classic sweet-savory combo of dark chocolate and peanut butter.

Each bite of one of our Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars starts out with the familiar soft 
texture of a granola or cereal bar, which gives way to the crunch of the peanuts and crispy soy, which itself turns 
to satisfying, mouth-filling chewiness. Add to that its almost candy-like peanut butter & chocolate profile and 
whopping 10 grams of protein per serving, and you've got a bar as utilitarian as it is delicious. We're selling 
7.05-oz. boxes of Chewy Chocolate & Peanut Butter Protein Bars, each containing five 1.41-oz. bars, for 
$3.49*, every day. You can find them with our other cereal bars.

"062485","Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed Butter Cups","Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter cups have ranked among our customers' favorite products on our shelves for 
quite some time. A rich, dark chocolate shell encasing creamy, salty peanut butter-what's not to love about 
that? Well, if you're allergic to peanuts, plenty!  It was this gap in salty, nutty-flavored, chocolatey candy offerings 
for the peanut-averse that inspired our product developer to create Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Sunflower 
Seed Butter Cups, the newest addition to our candy set.

The Cups themselves are formed with rich, fair trade Dark Chocolate, and measure about two inches in 
diameter. Encased in each Cup is a thick layer of Sunflower Seed Butter, which has been salted and sweetened 
just enough to avoid the bitterness that sometimes accompanies plain sunflower seed butter. This magical 
merger of dark chocolate and salty seed butter masterfully mimics the craveable creaminess of a peanut butter 
cup, without peanuts! And since we're talking about what you won't find in these cups, gluten, dairy, soy, and 
tree nuts are all absent from the ingredient deck as well. While the nut-free ingredient deck makes these Cups 
a fantastic addition to a school lunch box, make no mistake-it was their sweet-salty, creamy, can't-stop-eating-
them profile that truly won hearts (and stomachs) during our tasting panel.

Each kosher-certified, 1.4-ounce package contains two generously-sized Dark Chocolate Sunflower Seed 
Butter Cups, one for you and one for a friend (whether you share the second Cup or not is entirely up to you, 
of course). You'll find them near the registers at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, for the nutty value of 99¢

"062904","Jerk-Style Plantain Chips","While there's a fair bit of contention as to the precise origins of jerk cooking (some argue that it was invented 
by the indigenous Taino and Arawak peoples of Jamaica, while others assert that  escaped slaves created the 
cuisine after establishing their own communities on the island), one thing is indisputable: jerk seasoning is 
savory, spicy, and certifiably sensational. Based primarily on the flavors of allspice and hot red peppers, jerk 
seasoning is traditionally used on milder-flavored proteins like chicken or pork, but we find that it works 
equally well as a snack-enhancer. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips.

Drawing inspiration from classic Jamaican cooking, our Jerk-Style Plantain Chips pair the satisfying crunch 
of a plantain chip with the multitude of flavors of jerk seasoning. Each individual Chip is covered in a generous 
dusting of jerk cooking-inspired herbs and spices, including allspice, garlic powder, cinnamon, coriander, 
nutmeg, and ginger extract. What you'll likely notice above all other flavors, however, is the increasing heat of 
spicy red chili pepper powder. As you snack, the spice builds steadily (but not altogether overwhelmingly) to an 
exhilarating crescendo of heat, making it a perfect treat for the real spice fans out there (you know who you are.)

Indeed, Trader Joe's Jerk-Style Plantain Chips are big when it comes to spice, but they're actually quite modest 
when it comes to price: we're selling each six-ounce bag for $1.79, an especially great value when you consider 
that most other flavored plantain chips out there sell for $3 and up. You'll find them in our snack section.

what we've got: TJ's Saddle Potato Crisps/Make really excellent duck-bill lips/They look like saddles and taste like 
chips/Oooh, la-ti-da-di-da, dum-di-dum, dips!

Ok, so maybe it won't be a hit. But there is good reason to believe the snack, itself, will become a blockbuster 
with our Customers. That's because it's made from a combination of dried potatoes, corn meal, and rice flour 
formed into perfectly mouth-shaped Crisps. Saddles, if you will. They are cooked in sunflower oil to an

"062954","Plantain Crisps","Twice-fried plantains go by many names in Latin America and the Caribbean. You may have heard of tostones, 
patacones, or tachinos, but if you're lucky enough to have tried them, then you know that they're delicious, 
crispy, and phenomenally savory, no matter what they're called. We drew inspiration from this curiously 
crunchy treat to create our newest snack creation. Feel free to call them what you like - we call them Trader 
Joe's Plantain Crisps.

To make each Crisp, our supplier takes slices of green plantains (of the plátanos machos variety, to be specific), 
cooks them in oil, smashes them flat until they're around two to three inches in diameter, then cooks them 
again. These last two steps are where we depart most from tradition - our Crisps are much thinner than a 
typical tostone, and fried for a little longer, so that they're even crunchier,  more chip-like, and ready to scoop 
up your favorite guacamole or dip. Here's where we don't part from Trader Joe's tradition: our Plantain Crisps 
are a certified value at $2.49* for a five-ounce bag. Keep an eye out for them in our snack aisle.

"068992","Organic Freeze-Dried Berry Medley","Trader Joe's Organic Freeze-Dried Berry Medley contains a mixture of organic blueberries, organic 
strawberries, and organic raspberries-only these berries have all been dried at a very low temperature, which 
tends to preserve flavor better than heat drying. You can definitely taste the blueberry-ness of the blueberries 
and the strawberry-ness of the strawberries. Even the raspberries retain their raspberry-ness! 

Of course, while the naturally sweet & tart flavors remain true, the soft juiciness of non-dried fruit is replaced 
by a wonderfully light crunch. This means the Berry Medley is ideal for snacking, or for topping yogurt. Mix 
it with your favorite nuts to create a berry-licious trail mix. Sprinkle a handful over your bowl of Strawberry 
Non-dairy Oat Frozen Dessert [sku 67830]. You might even throw some in your smoothie for a formidable fruit 
boost.

Notably, it takes about 7.6 ounces of fresh fruit to make all of what's contained in this 1.2-ounce bag of Organic 
Freeze-Dried Berries. This equals about 3.5 servings of fruit, including 9g of fiber and just 120 calories! You'll 
also appreciate that we've added no sugar and no sulfur. It's just fruit! Find it in our nuts & dried fruit section.

based and almond butter-filled ABC Bar, and you'll be singing along and stepping in time before you know it. 

Trader Joe's Almond Butter Cocoa Bars-which we're affectionately calling ABC Bars for short-are sweet, 
salty, and sure to satisfy. They're pocket-sized squares of oat-and-rice-flour-based, chocolatey dough (made with 
real cocoa and a dash of almond butter), sweetened with fig paste and filled with almond butter. They're like our 
PB & J Bars' [sku 56271] chocolatey, almond-y cousin.

Pack one in your lunch pail. Toss one in your gym bag. Keep one in your purse or pocket for on-the-go snacking. 
And if you're really hungry, here's an idea: make an Almond Butter Cocoa Bar sandwich by drizzling one ABC 
Bar with TJ's Creamy Almond Butter [sku 51435] and stacking another ABC Bar on top.

"057437","Just a Handful of Rainbow's End Trail Mix","In Norse mythology, the Bifröst is a rainbow bridge that connects the human world to Asgard, the realm of the 
gods. The gods built the bridge with air (blue), fire (red) and water (green). Scholars have interpreted Bifröst to 
mean ""fleetingly glimpsed rainbow"" or ""swaying road to heaven."" While we're not experts in Norse mythology, 
and we couldn't tell you which translation is correct, we're almost certain that those at the end of the Bifröst 
would find Trader Joe's Just a Handful of Rainbow's End Trail Mix worthy of Asgardian approval.

Our Handfuls of Rainbow's End Trail Mix contain the same colorful, tasty mix we've carried for years, 
conveniently portioned into 1.5-ounce bags. Candy-coated milk chocolates are the first ingredient, in a rainbow 
of colors: blue, green, orange, red, and yellow. Unlike other mixes on the market, the chocolate candy shells 
are colored with naturally available ingredients (turmeric, spirulina and red radish powder) that are mixed 
with coconut wax for celestial shine. Roasted & salted peanuts and almonds add loads of nutty crunch, and 
California raisins provide chewy texture and sweet, sun-kissed flavor. 

With two grams of fiber and five grams of protein per bag, this kosher (dairy) Mix is ready to sustain you in a 
mythological battle-or more accurately, squash snack cravings. Toss a Handful in your gym bag for a post-
workout boost, or keep one in your desk drawer to avoid an afternoon slump. In addition to solo snacking, their 
pre-portioned convenience allows you to throw just the right amount of Trail Mix atop ice cream or yogurt.

Whether you're traveling the Bifröst or just trekking across town, pick up Trader Joe's Just a Handful of

"070222","Dark Chocolate Drizzled Plantain Chips","When it comes to our iconic Plantain Chips [sku 97208], there's much to celebrate: there's their resounding crunch, 
their subtle savory flavor, their oh-so-craveable, can't-have-just-one quality, for starters. But we'd like to take a 
moment to be especially complimentary of their complementary nature. No matter the pairing, be it creamy dips, 
fruity salsas, or spicy hummuses, Plantain Chips are up for the job. That got us thinking: what about something 
sweet? What about something that combines the light, salty & savory snackability of crispy plantains with bold, 
flavorful dark chocolate? What about Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Drizzled Plantain Chips?

The process is simple: our supplier takes our original Plantain Chips and drizzles them with a delicious zig zag 
of rich dark chocolate, and finishes them off with a bit of sea salt. The result is extraordinary: the crunch of 
the plantain accentuates the creaminess of the chocolate, which is itself accentuated by the salt. Delightfully 
complex and uniquely flavorful, they're an excellent anytime snack all on their own, but dare we suggest giving 
them a dip in our Chocolate Hummus [sku 64204]? We do dare. After all, we're daring enough to sell each six-

Trader Joe's 3 Seed Beet Crackers have a punctuated name and a punctuated ingredient list, but there's no 
shortage of flavor in these tasty little crackers. Black sesame seeds, flax seeds, and chia seeds pair up with white 
corn and beet powder to create small, cylindrical crackers that sort of look like mini red tortilla chips. A bit 
of paprika, onion powder, and sea salt round out the flavor of these rounds. The vibrant color makes these 
Crackers virtually unmatched when it comes to festive snacks.

"059721","Gluten Free Norwegian Crispbread","What do Vikings and Trader Joe's have in common? Well, Trader Joe's isn't planning on going on raids or building 
an empire (unless that empire is selling high-quality, delicious foods at low prices), but both have traveled the 
world trading goods, and¿ crispbread. It is believed that crispbread can be traced back to the Vikings, who 
stored it on ships for long journeys across sea. They lived on spare diets in terms of crops and produce due to 
the cold weather, but crispbread was one food that brought them sustenance. Our buyers foraged and plundered 
(a more exciting way to say ""worked"") for months to get their hands on the perfect Trader Joe's Whole Grain 
Crispbread [sku 55902], and succeed they did. 

But then we began to wonder... What about the gluten-intolerant Vikings? Surely they, too, would have enjoyed 
and benefited from a hearty Crispbread from time to time, right? Well, while we can't amend the past, we can 
enhance the present - with Trader Joe's Gluten Free Crispbread. You may not be journeying for months on a 
knar (Viking merchant ship) anytime soon, but we think our made-in-Norway Gluten Free Crispbread will be 
an excellent addition to your everyday diet. Its ingredients include sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds; oat flakes; 
rice bran; potato flour; and a few other straightforward additions, like salt and a touch of honey. With 4g of 
protein and 3g of fiber per cracker, a Viking could live off of these! They're mildly salty and totally seedy - with 
a coarse, crumbly, oh-so-gratifying crunch. 

You can serve Gluten Free Crispbread alone, but you can also serve them as an appetizer with some Goat Milk 
Brie [sku 86647] or as a dipping partner for a steaming bowl of Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup 
[sku 57879]. We are selling the 7.55-ounce bag of 10 Whole Grain Crispbreads for $4.29; a price that won't raid 
your wallet. You'll find them with our crackers and snacks.

"061490","Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar","As far as confectionary conflicts go, few battles have raged as passionately or as endlessly as the rivalry between 
milk and dark chocolate. For ages, milk chocolate aficionados have pointed to the smoothness and accessibility of 
a classic milk chocolate bar, while dark chocolate devotees have countered with the bold and bracing flavors that 
only the dark side can provide. We're happy to report that these arguments may be set aside in favor of coopera-
tion, collaboration, and caramelization in the form of Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits 
Bar, a candy concord between milk and dark chocolate, brokered by the presence of crunchy bits of butterscotch.

Upon unwrapping a Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar from its appropriately marbled packaging, 
you'll see that its commitment to cocoa harmony extends even to its appearance: a perfect swirl of milk and dark 
chocolate, segmented into easy-to-break-off, even-easier-to-share triangular pieces. And, of course, each bite only 
furthers that spirit of unity, with the milk chocolate laying a smooth, creamy foundation, upon which the dark 
chocolate builds striking cocoa flavor which intermingles superbly with the sugary crunch of flawlessly dispersed 
granules of butterscotch. Truly, teamwork makes the dream work.

While there's never a bad time or situation to enjoy a candy bar of this caliber, Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Choco-
late Butterscotch Bits Bar's shareability and easy portioning make it an excellent choice for movie screenings, 
binge watch parties, or as a companion for long road trips and air travel. However and wherever you enjoy it, be 
ready to break off a few segments for hungry onlookers-just think of it as chocolate diplomacy.

Milk and dark chocolate fans, both, the time has come to unify, to give a piece (or two, or three) a chance! We're 
selling each three-ounce Trader Joe's Milk & Dark Chocolate Butterscotch Bits Bar for $1.79, making it a candy 
bar and a value that everyone can agree on.

"066493","Olive & Herbs Mixed Nuts","Mixed nuts are a great snack option when you've grown a little bored of one nut or another at a time. Trader 
Joe's Olive & Herbs Mixed Nuts not only brings you a mix of three favorite nuts, but also brings in some dried 
olives and serious seasonings for a truly unique eating experience.

The nut-base consists of whole, crunchy, almonds; buttery, cashew kernels; and pecan pieces with their tender 
crunch. They're all tossed in a herb blend that includes oregano, sage, thyme, basil, marjoram, rosemary-and 
of course, sea salt. Perhaps the kicker, however, is the addition of Kalamata olives from Greece. The olives have 
been dehydrated and tossed in sunflower oil and extra virgin olive oil with some sea salt. The softer texture of 
the olives, along with their pleasantly pungent tang really brings this snack mix to life, not to mention the way 
the herbs aromatically accent the nutty trio! Find Olive & Herbs Mixed Nuts in our nuts section.

"055691","Scandinavian Swimmers","Trader Joe's Scandinavian Swimmers are soft, chewy candies, in the shape of sea creatures, bursting with fruity 
flavors, and colored with spirulina and fruit & vegetable extracts (pumpkin, carrot, black carrot, black currant, 
and apple) instead of synthetic dyes. 

The creatures within the aquatically-themed pouch are some you might encounter in the ocean, or perhaps 
an aquarium. There's a blue dolphin (huckleberry flavored), a red lobster (berry flavored), a sea horse (mango 
peach flavored), and a rock fish (rock flavored-just kidding, it tastes like orange). 

They're soft, not-quite gummy in texture, and much more flavorful than other, similarly soft candies we've 
tasted. We haven't seen any other candies in this category whose ingredients are as wholesome as ours-we're 
not calling these ""health food,"" mind you. We know they're candy. They're just candy without so much junk in 
their recipe.

They're also candy you can afford to keep in your secret stash. We're selling each 14 ounce pouch for $2.99, a 
splashy value, every day. Only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"063277","Red Chili Scalloped Crackers","During the holiday season, we offer our Scalloped Cracker Trio [sku 57645], an assortment of three distinctive 
crackers, presented in an equally-distinctive scalloped-edge shape. Since we first introduced this assortment, 
we've received constant, consistent feedback from customers - ""we love these crackers, escpecially the Red 
Chili flavor."" As we like to do, we listened to this feedback, and as a result, Trader Joe's Red Chili Scalloped 
Crackers came to be.

These are the very same crackers found in the Trio. They begin as traditional water-style crackers, and they're 
seasoned with a bit of red chili to deliver just a bit of heat. How much heat? Enough so you'll know it's there to 
greet you - hello, heat! - and yet it's subtle enough that you can still enjoy these topped with cheese, dips, or 
even crumbled into soup. They're really impressive crumbled into chili - perhaps that's gilding the lily, er, chili. 
And that's quite all right by us.  We're offering Red Chili Scalloped Crackers in a 6.5 ounce box, every day.

"063382","Joe-Joe's Slims","Of all the snacks we've carried over the years, few have retained the iconic status and devoted following of our 
classic Joe-Joe's [sku 82756] and their many permutations. Through holidays and flavor crazes, we've readily 
expanded our Joe-Joe's selections based on our customer's response, and we have no plans of stopping. In fact, 
we're taking this opportunity to expand via contraction: going bigger by thinking thinner with Trader Joe's Joe-
Joe's Slims, all the same delicious flavor of a chocolaty creme Joe-Joe's cookie in a slimmer, crispier size.

By now, you know the time-honored taste of a Joe-Joe: robust, crunchy, chocolate cookies, sandwiching sweet 
vanilla creme. With Joe-Joe's Slims, our supplier has simply taken these same elements and recontextualized 
them into a thinner, lighter, easier-snacking format. With a much slimmer cookie and lighter application of 
creme, each Slim has the texture and snap of a cracker, making it an even more versatile dessert snack. A lighter 
profile means easier munching, meaning more opportunities to have a few quick bites. Of course, their skinnier 
size also makes them better accessories for even more indulgent expereinces as well: in addition to dunking 
your cookies in milk, now you can use them to scoop up Belgian Chocolate Pudding [sku 32130] like some kind 
of marveouls chocolate nacho - oh yes, we went there.

Of course, Trader Joe's Joe-Joe's Slims aren't just slighter in size: each 10.9 oz box comes with a slender pricetag 
of $1.99. Please join us in welcoming Joe-Joe's Slims to the Joe-Joe family! You'll find them in our cookie aisle,

on. One combination we're particularly passionate about is chocolate and orange. Specifically, dark chocolate and 
orange. And, after searching high and low, we've found a new supplier to produce our beloved Dark Chocolate 
Orange Sticks to our (very high) standards. In fact, they're better than ever, because they just happen to come 
from the very same confectionary that churns out our wildly popular Scandinavian Swimmers [sku 55691]!

New Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Orange Sticks are short, chubby ""sticks"" of orange-flavored jelly smothered 
in rich, dark chocolate. Their jelly centers are soft, but not at all gooey, and their gelatinous softness presents a 
delightful contrast to the Sticks' thick, chocolate-y exteriors-a real textural treat.  Also, per usual, our Dark 
Chocolate Orange Sticks don't contain any artificial flavors. Instead, they get their bright, citrusy punch from 
real orange juice concentrate. 

We're selling each 10-ounce, conveniently resealable pouch (no more plastic tubs!) of Dark Chocolate Orange 
Sticks for $2.99-which is at least two dollars less than they're sold for anywhere else. You'll find them in our 
candy aisle.

"066811","Everything But The Gluten Crackers","Lots of our Customers love those traditional seedy Norwegian crackers we started selling several years ago. 
Both our Whole Grain Crispbread [sku 55902] and our Gluten Free Crispbread [sku 59721] continue to supply 
all the crunchy, seedy goodness TJ's cracker lovers crave. Knowing there's also lots of love for flavorful, seedy, 
seasoning blends, we concocted a fusion that's sure to be another favorite in this line!

Trader Joe's Everything But the Gluten Crispbread Crackers are similar to the original Crispbreads, especially 
in their super-crunchiness and their amalgam of various seeds and grains. However, they depart from the 
original formulas in two specific ways. First, these are smaller, cut into rectangles that are about two-bite 
sized. They are kind of more what you'd expect from a regular cracker. Second, these Crispbread Crackers are 
seasoned with a special mix that mimics our Everything but the Bagel Seasoning. Here, we include white & black 
sesame seeds, granulated onion, dried minced garlic, and salt.

This combination of crispbread and savory seasoning is out of this world (technically, it's out of Norway from 
the same talented supplier who makes our other Crispbreads), whether you enjoy them alone or topped with a 
spread. And just like our regular Gluten Free Crispbread, these Everything but the Gluten Crackers are 100% 
gluten free. It's in the name! Find the 4.2-ounce packages above our freezers with other crackers.

"065930","Dark Chocolate Salted Caramel Bar Thin","Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Salted Caramel Bar Thins are unique in two distinct ways. First, these made-in-
Belgium Bars are very slim. This gives each notched Thin a crave-able snap when you bite into it. They are also 
unique in that each snappy bite reveals a surprise inside: creamy, Salted Caramel! 

There's another benefit to these Dark Chocolate Bars being so Thin. It's that each individual bar (one serving) 
contains just 130 calories. That's less than most snack bars-and much more yummy!

Keep them in your desk drawer for when you crave a sweet snack. Each piece is just enough to satisfy, but not 
so much you'll regret treating yourself. We're selling Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate Salted Caramel Thins in

"069082","Everything But The Bagel Seasoned Potato Chips","It's no secret that our Customers go gaga over our Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [59137]. It's 
become a pantry staple in households across the country, practically pushing it to instant ""TJ's Hall of Fame"" 
status back when we introduced it in January of 2017. Now, on the cusp of E.B.T.B.'s 3rd TJ-a-versary, we're 
elevating the essence of ""everything"" to even greater heights, with new Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel 
Seasoned Kettle Cooked Potato Chips.

Made with Lady Clair and Dakota Pearl potatoes grown in western Canada, our supplier fries these Chips 
in small batches, then kettle-cooks them until they're ready to be seasoned and cooled. This method-as 
opposed to the typical ""continuous fry"" method of chip-making-results in extra-flavorful chips with a harder, 
crunchier bite. But let's not pretend the potatoes are the star of this show-as they say, ""It's the seasoning, silly!"" 
We're talking salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper (plus a pinch of 
sugar, a splash of sesame oil, and additional natural flavors), a.k.a. all that and a bag of chips¿literally.

At TJ's we talk a whole lot about value, so instead of charging a pretty penny for these scrumptious specialty Chips 
like another store might, we're selling TJ's Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Kettle Cooked Potato Chips for 
$2.49* per seven-ounce bag. You'll find them in our snack section.

"067751","Twisted Cookie Sticks","Like the chocolate unicorn zebras on the canister, these Dark Chocolate Cookies Sticks are a wonder. It's not 
so much a question of how they are made. That's pretty straightforward-wheat-flour sticks, baked then dipped 
in dark chocolate.

The wonder comes in the way the semi-sweetness of the smooth, rich, dark chocolate (not accidentally from 
Belgium) contrasts with the crisp crunch of the Cookie and its muted saltiness. It's sort of like a chocolate 
dipped pretzel, yet subtler. And, more cookie-like. Wonder-ful!

The tall tube makes is super easy to share with friends. Pop open the top and fan out the 25 or so Cookie Sticks 
for everyone to enjoy. Not many will say no, especially when they hear that each Trader Joe's Dark Chocolate 
Cookie Stick only has 14 calories!

"097208","Plantain Chips","Plantains are a close relative to the banana we all know and love. While you normally eat bananas raw, plantains 
are almost always cooked before eating to take the more firm, harder edge off of the fruit. Where bananas are 
sweet, plantains are on the starchy side and though plantains are technically a fruit, they're commonly eaten 
like root vegetables. When you think of them this way, Trader Joe's Plantain Chips make perfect sense to be 
added to our collection of snackable chips.

Our Plantain Chips come from Peru, where the plantains are picked when they're just ripe enough to be 
slightly sweet. They're sliced and cooked in sunflower oil, then dusted with salt. They eat like sort-of-sweet, 
thick-cut potato chips, but with half the fat of typical potato chips. So while you may say we've gone bananas 
offering each six-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Plantain Chips for a measly $1.79*, we'd really like if you'd say 
""we've gone plantains"".

"069148","Grainless Tortilla Chips","Trader Joe's Grainless Tortilla Chips don't just have less grain, they have none!

Instead of corn and wheat, we start with flours made from coconut and from cassava (a starchy, South American 
tuber) to which we add a delicious seasoning blend of sesame & poppy seeds, dried garlic & onion, and sea salt. 
Trimmed into triangles, the dough is then fried in avocado oil to an airy crisp. It's plenty of flavor for straight 
snacking-but not too much to overwhelm your salsa & guacamolé!

"066408","Plantain Croutons","Plantains are quickly becoming the brightest star in our constellation of starches. From their breakout role 
in our long-adored Plantain Chips [sku 97208], to their more recent turn as the base of our frozen Tostones 
[sku  61295], our love for their savory flavor and ability to crisp up to a superbly satisfying texture has only 
increased over the years. That's why, when the time came to find a medium for a crouton that was delightfully 
crunchy, but still decidedly gluten free, we knew that one fruit would stand head and shoulders above the rest 
of the bunch. Now, Trader Joe's Plantain Croutons are here to provide some resounding crunch, along with 
gratifyingly garlicky seasoning, to salads, soups, and anything else that might benefit from a bit of extra flavor 
and texture. 

These Plantain Croutons are made especially for us by a supplier in Ecuador who specializes in plantain-based 
snacks. One of the reasons they work so well is that they use green plantains, which are slightly starchier and 
lower in sugar, and have an almost potato-like texture. That translates to a superior crunch in every Crouton, 
despite containing no gluten. And since it's only available at Trader Joe's, that translates to superior value: we're 
selling each five ounce bag of Plantain Croutons for $1.99*, every day.

"066292","85% Dark Chocolate Bar from Uganda","We know our Customers love 85% dark chocolate. How do we know this? Well, because of the way our 85% 
Dark Chocolate Lover's Bar [sku 93184] has been received-and consumed! Our latest dark chocolate bar sticks 
to this cacao percentage, but instead of coming from the Tumaco region of Colombia, the cacao in this 85% 
Dark Chocolate Bar comes from Uganda.

The beans are from a series of small farms in Western Uganda, located at the foot of the Rwenzori Mountains. 
In true bean-to-bar fashion, the cacao is harvested, dried, and fermented in partnership with a 3rd generation, 
family-owned Italian chocolatier. But don't assume this partnership is a long-distance relationship. In fact, 
one of the Italian Executive Directors is based in Uganda (even married to a Ugandan woman!) where he 
helps guarantee the origin of the beans from Ugandan farmers who still own the lands on which the cacao is 
cultivated. It's a symbiotic partnership that yields some stellar chocolate!

The final result of this African-Italian collaboration is fine, full-flavored, 85% Dark Chocolate that has rich 
caramel top notes and mildly fruity undertones-with just a slight acidity. We're selling this Uganda Chocolate 
Bar every day in our stores. Look for it among our other high-quality chocolates, above the freezers and at the 
checkout stands.

"063991","Chile & Garlic Cashews","With their unique, buttery, mildly nutty flavor, cashews are really enjoyable when simply roasted with a little 
salt. In addition to selling them this way, Trader Joe's has also capitalized on their fantastic flavor by using 
cashews as a base for a variety of seasonings, including our Coconut Cashews [sku 51127], Sesame Honey 
Cashews [sku 57068], and Thai Lime Cashews [sku 60389]. 

Now, we're adding Trader Joe's Chile & Garlic Cashews to this list. Whole cashews are roasted and dusted 
with a seasoning that includes chile powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. There's also little bit of 
lime powder and cane sugar to provide hints of acid and sweetness in contrast with the plentiful savoriness. 
Of course, Chile & Garlic Cashews are excellent eaten out of hand or next to your favorite fizzy beverage-
but this flavor profile in particular also works well in recipes. Add it to your homemade stir-frys, or even TJ's 
Asian-inspired dishes, like our Mandarin Orange Chicken [sku 66563].
