"078929","Cheesy Herby Biscuits","At a big, holiday dinner, every dish has its role. The role of the protein is to act as the anchor, to center the plate 
and give it focus. The role of the veggie side dish is to provide a complementary taste and textural contrast to 
the protein. And of course, one of the most important roles is that of¿ well¿ the roll! Whether it's in the form 
of a dinner roll, mini baguette, or biscuit, the always-stalwart starch is a vital, hearty, gravy-sopping component 
to any holiday meal-and Trader Joe's Cheesy Herby Biscuits serve as a sensationally savory way to ensure 
this role is filled at your feast. 

Made with buttery, flaky dough, flavored with aromatic herbs like rosemary and thyme, and studded with 
shreds of rich Parmesan and Cheddar, our Cheesy Herby Biscuits arrive at our store frozen, so they're easy 
to grab ahead of time without worrying they'll get stale before the big day. They also taste best when baked 
directly from frozen (no need to proof!), in an un-preheated oven set to 375°F for about 30 minutes-the 
gradual heating helps the Biscuits retain their buttery, cheesy texture. Flaky, flavorful, and formidable, Trader 
Joe's Cheesy Herby Biscuits are a fantastic way to fill the roll role at Thanksgiving, the year-end holidays, or 
any other get-together where food is at the forefront.

"078523","Spicy Farfalle Pasta with Italian Chicken Sausage","Over the years, we've really grown our selection of Trader Joe's Italian-style pastas. In our freezers, you'll find a 
variety of noodle shapes and sauce options, from Spaghetti Carbonara [sku 75759] and Fettuccine Alfredo [sku 
41423] to Rigatoni Alla Contadina [sku 74185] and Penne Arrabbiata [sku 87813]. One thing these products all 
have in common-aside from being incredibly delicious values-is that they all serve more than one person 
(unless you're super hungry!). We decided it was time we created a single serving, frozen pasta dish, for when 
you're craving a hassle-free meal, but cooking just for one.

It starts with durum wheat Farfalle, a pasta shape not yet featured among our frozen pastas. These ""bowties"" 
are covered in a rich & spicy tomato sauce and paired with crumbles of savory Italian Chicken Sausage. To 
prepare, simply cook the Pasta from frozen according to the package instructions, plate it up, and enjoy! 

This Pasta dish is Spicy, but you're craving even more heat, try adding a spoonful of Italian Bomba Hot Pepper 
Sauce [sku 61934]. And if you want to add some fresh flair, we recommend some torn leaves of Organic Basil 
[sku 67343]. With or without these extras, you're in for a tasty meal... and we guarantee you won't have to worry 
about the leftovers. You'll find 12-ounce packages of Trader Joe's Farfalle Pasta with Italian Chicken Sausage 
in our freezers, every day.

"078810","Cheesy Creamy Greens & Veggies","""Can you please put the cheese back and get some greens instead?"" asks the veggie lover of the veggie skeptic 
as they peruse their neighborhood Trader Joe's. ""If loving cheese is wrong, I don't want to be right!"" the 
skeptic cries, appalled by such a demand. Suddenly, out of the corners of their eyes, they see it: Cheesy Creamy 
Greens & Veggies. They share a glance. They smile. They realize this rich, Veggie-laden delight is the culinary 
peacemaker of their dreams. 

Cheesy Creamy Greens & Veggies start on a luxurious note with a butter, flour, and nutmeg roux. Onions, 
garlic, and black pepper lend aromatics and spice, while dried porcini mushrooms contribute deep umami. 
Then come provolone and mozzarella. Melty and salty-sweet, they expertly put the ""cheese"" in Cheesy Creamy 
Greens & Veggies. And, of course, cooked spinach finds cruciferous comrades in earthy kale and crisp Brussels 
sprouts. The result is a rich, textured, and Veggie-packed side dish or quick dinner that heats from frozen in 
eight minutes or less. Each box yields about two cups prepared, so there's plenty to satisfy even the pickiest of 
eaters. You'll find Cheesy Creamy Greens & Veggies only during the holiday season-pick up a box and bridge 
the veggie divide while supplies last!

"078275","Teriyaki Chicken Bowl","Rich and juicy with savory-sweet flavor, it's no wonder that Trader Joe's BBQ Teriyaki Chicken [sku 74961] has 
been a customer favorite since 2004. It's a complete meal alongside white rice and steamed veggies, but on days 
you can't be bothered to take out the rice cooker and the steamer basket, Teriyaki Chicken Bowls make for an 
extra speedy and equally delicious alternative.

Much like the classic Japanese preparations of Teriyaki Chicken, we like to keep it simple. Establishing the 
foundation is chunks of dark Chicken thigh meat-think dense and juicy, with especially Chicken-y flavor. As 
for the sauce, ginger, garlic, and lime juice lend aromatic tang, while soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, and sugar 
contribute quintessentially sweet, umami-laden Teriyaki flavor. 

To make it a complete meal, we lay the Chicken over a bed of Calrose rice, alongside broccoli, carrots, and bok 
choy. It's an all-in-one lunch or dinner that heats from frozen in the microwave in about four minutes. If you've 
got a second to spare, garnish your Bowl with sesame seeds and sliced green onions, or a squirt of Sriracha 
Sauce [sku 50828] for a spicy kick.

"076535","Roti with Thai Red Curry","Roti canai is a flatbread and curry dish that originated in India in the 1800s. In the decades after its inception, 
Southeast Asian countries like Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand developed their own 
variations. And now, Trader Joe's takes a spin on this classic combination with our Roti with Thai Red Curry.

You'll find three Roti in each box. They're made with wheat flour, sea salt, and rice bran oil & shortening for 
layered, flaky flatbreads. For the Red Curry, we mix together rich coconut milk with a considerably spicy Red 
Curry paste containing traditional Thai seasonings like lemongrass, birds eye chiles, spur chiles, Thai basil, 
and galangal (a cooling, pine-like spice, if you're unfamiliar). We finish things off with a light-yet-filling mix of 
green eggplant, cabbage, and potatoes. We'd say this vegan duo is ro-teeming with bright, complex flavors and 
wonderfully complementary textures. 

To prepare it, warm the Roti on a skillet, in the oven, or in the air fryer according to package directions. Then, 
thaw the Curry packet in warm water for 1-2 minutes before heating through in the microwave or on the stove. 
To eat it, tear off pieces of the Roti and use them to scoop up the Curry, or pour the Curry on top of the Roti. 
Enjoy as a quick and filling snack, or make it a flavorful dinner alongside a glass of zesty Emma Reichart Dry 
Riesling [sku 61437] or a can of light Simpler Times Lager [sku 62590].

"033700","Mushroom Risotto","Risotto comes from the Italian word ""riso"", which means ""rice"" in English. Now, you can't talk about risotto 
without mentioning its main ingredient, which is rice of course. Since the introduction of the grain, rice 
farming has been a major part of life for many Italian families. 

Trader Joe's Mushroom Risotto is imported from Italy and made by one of the best. The dish is authentic, 
creamy, savory, and extremely delicious! The ""riso"" is parcooked and combined with cream, slices of mushroom, 
onion, garlic, and extra Porcini mushroom seasoning. For a complete Italian dinner, light some candles, dim 
the lights and offer Trader Joe's Mushroom Risotto with a side of Focaccia Bread [sku 64435] and Balsamic 
Vinegar [sku 58036] or Italian President's Reserve [sku 30090] for dipping. Make the Risotto the star on the 
table as a main entree with your favorite protein and Caesar Salad [sku 05161].

"075292","Coffee Panna Cotta","Crème caramel, flan, rožata, purin, pudin karamel-the many variations of caramel-covered custard have 
many names around the world. Here at Trader Joe's, our creamy, coffee-imbued version goes by Coffee Panna 
Cotta, and is available in our refrigerated section for a limited time. 

Our Panna Cotta (Italian for ""cooked cream"") is made for us in Texas by a Portugese company that specializes in 
the dessert. Our supplier combines the Panna Cotta starting lineup of cream, milk, and sugar with a generous 
amount of Coffee powder for intense Coffee flavor. While many Panna Cottas are gelatinous in texture, ours is 
decidedly creamy and more texturally akin to flan. Caramelized syrup sits in the bottom of the two individual 
foil cups in each package, finishing off the Panna Cotta with rich and toasty sweetness. 

To serve, peel back the lid, carefully run a knife around the perimeter of the Panna Cotta, flip it upside down 
onto a plate, and enjoy. Serve it with a glass of Chocolate Whole Milk [sku 61673] for a mocha-inspired dessert. 
Or, pay homage to this Panna Cotta's Portugese roots by pairing it with luscious and toasty Morgado Tawny

questions with fanciful fall flair. Introducing Trader Joe's Savory Squash Pastry Bites!

First things first-unwrap the Pastry Bites and place them on a baking sheet. After about 12 minutes in a 
400°F oven (or half that time in an air fryer), you'll be rewarded with a buttery Pastry crust teeming with a 
pumpkin & butternut Squash-forward filling, along with a Savory symphony of flavors courtesy of not one, but 
four different cheeses-namely, creamy mascarpone and ricotta, tangy feta, and pleasantly sharp Parmesan. 
Finished with chopped chives, these Pastry Bites lend an air of elegance to an appetizer platter or buffet spread 
for a harvest fête (don't forget the bubbly!), and are equally at home on a weeknight dinner plate alongside a 
crisp green salad topped with crumbled White Stilton® Cheese with Apple & Pear [sku 79157]. 

While these Savory Squash Pastry Bites may look upscale, their price is, happily, not! You'll find them in the

"078836","Gluten Free Cheese Pizza","Trader Joe's sells Gluten Free Pizza Dough [sku 64663] if you're in the mood to make a pie from scratch. But if 
you're looking for a ready-to-bake, gluten free solution, look no further than Trader Joe's Gluten Free Cheese 
Pizza with a Cauliflower Crust. 

You've seen this kind of pie before, even in our freezers, so we can't exactly claim it's revolutionary. We can 
say that the delicious Gluten Free crust (first ingredient: Cauliflower) develops a nice crispness in just 10-12 
minutes in the oven. It handily delivers our tangy tomato sauce, and melty mozzarella & provolone cheeses 
right to your mouth. 

Perhaps what's most impressive about this Gluten Free Cheese Pizza is the possibilities. While we've engineered 
this pie to be enjoyable just as it is, it's also a blank canvas for your own pizza creativity. And with a Trader Joe's 
store full of toppings, it's safe to say, the possibilities are endless!

They've got a chewy exterior and lush ice cream center. They taste like your morning cup of joe. Why, they're 
Coffee Mochi, here for a limited time!

Unlike other Mochi on the market made with synthetically derived flavors and high fructose corn syrup, 
the frozen filling in Trader Joe's Coffee Mochi gets its bold Coffee flavor and color from Coffee itself, and 
possesses a balanced sweetness thanks to real cane sugar. A hint of cocoa gives the sweet, chewy rice flour 
dough its rich brown hue, and adds a touch of chocolate on the palate to round out the robust Coffee notes. 

Coffee Mochi make for a delightful handheld pick-me-up that's best enjoyed after thawing for 3-4 minutes. 
That may seem like a long time, but you'll be hard pressed to eat just one anyway, so why not assemble a variety 
platter of these gluten free treats while you're at it? Reach for Vanilla [sku 64500], Strawberry [64499], and

means you have all the more time to focus on what might be the most important part of such an important

"075821","Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein","The classic Chinese-American restaurant menu has nearly too many hits to name. Wonton soup? An absolute 
winner. Chow mein? A total chart-topper. Fried rice? A certified phenom. And for the newest addition to our 
frozen entrée assortment, we're drawing inspiration from one of the greatest hits of them all: lo mein. Made for 
us by a longtime supplier in Thailand who specializes in succulent shrimp dishes, Trader Joe's Ginger Shrimp 
Lo Mein offers all the same rich aromatics, savory flavors, and tantalizingly toothsome textures that made lo 
mein such a legend in the first place.

Inside each package of Trader Joe's Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein, you'll find a pack of wheat noodles, a medley of 
veggies including white cabbage and bell peppers, and a pouch of raw shrimp in a savory ginger-shiitake sauce. 
All it takes is a few minutes of sautéeing in a skillet for these ingredients to go from frozen to steamy, fragrant, 
and ready to eat. Ginger Shrimp Lo Mein can be enjoyed on its own as an entrée for one or two, or combined 
with other dishes as part of a family-style feast: we particularly like pairing it with some garlicky, stir-fried Baby 
Broccoli [sku 47468], and a plate of steamed Chicken Gyoza Potstickers [sku 03663].

ripeness. It's then roasted over an open flame, adding a smoky dimension to the corn's natural sweetness. After 
roasting, the corn is individually quick frozen to ensure freshness and allow you to use what you like now and 
save the rest for another time. 

If you're looking for a versatile side dish, our Roasted Corn may just fit the bill. The corn is great by itself and 
fits great with a variety of other combinations, especially in ethnic dishes. Once cooked, toss the amount of 
Corn you would like to use for a Mexican-style salad with Organic Black Beans [sku 50262], quinoa, cilantro, 
topped with sweet peppers, onions, avocado and creamy, Cilantro Dressing [sku 36420] with crumbled cotija 
cheese. The Corn makes for a delicious Elote in a cup, also known as Esquites. Just like you would on a corn on 
the cob, add Real Mayonnaise [sku 01482], grated Cotija Cheese [sku 65005], chili powder, and a Trader Joe's

winsome dim sum tradition of Chinese xiao long bao, these aromatic and savory, soup-filled dumplings are 
such a darling, in fact, that we've received countless requests to make a vegan version, as well. After trying a few 
variations, our tasting panel found that a mix of jackfruit, carrot, cabbage, spinach, and ginger for the filling, 
along with a hearty, aromatic broth (made with vegan-friendly agar-agar, rather than gelatin) made for a truly 
captivating combination-and thus, Trader Joe's Steamed Vegetable Soup Dumplings were born!

Just like our Pork and Chicken variations, our Steamed Vegetable Soup Dumplings can be made in a matter 
of minutes in the microwave or steamer on your stovetop. Also like their predecessors, once heated through, 
the soup inside of them does become quite hot-we recommend serving them in a deep spoon, carefully 
puncturing the top of the side of the dumpling with your teeth or some chopsticks, then letting the soup seep 
into the spoon to cool down until it's ready to slurp. We also heartily recommend enjoying them with a bit of 
Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce [sku 26426] and Crunchy Chili Onion [sku 62480] for an even more satisfying Soup 
Dumpling experience.

Made with coconut milk, wheat flour, cane sugar, rice bran shortening, and vanilla bean paste, our vegan

For about the same price you'd pay for a single boba drink at a café, our Tropical Green Tea Boba Kit contains 
four pouches of vegan, gluten-free, tapioca pearls in a sweet, passion fruit & mango-flavored green tea syrup, 
plus four wide-gauge paper straws to help you capture some of said pearls in every sip. The Boba pearls only 
take a minute in the microwave to heat up; from there, it's just a matter of placing them into the bottom of  a 
glass, adding ice, and pouring in your beverage of choice, like milk, green tea, coconut beverage, or even just 
cold water-anything goes! Then sit back, take a sip, and enjoy the sweet, refreshing, texturally satisfying ride.

Trader Joe's Panzerotti Pizza Bites, that's what! Made for us in Southern Italy by a supplier who specializes in 
this very appetizer, these two-to-three-bite-sized, lightly fried Pizza pockets take the concept of ""after-school 
pizza rolls"" and elevates it to flavorful new heights!

Picture this: each Trader Joe's Panzerotti Pizza Bite begins with a pleasantly chewy, half-moon-shaped pouch 
of pizza dough, which gets subsequently stuffed with a melty, mozzarella cheese blend and bold Italian tomato 
sauce, then quick-fried in vegetable oil. Simple? Yes. Simply irresistable? Also yes. Just heat them from frozen 
(we're talking 12 minutes in a conventional oven, 8-10 minutes in an air fryer, or 1-2 minutes in a microwave 
here, folks-minimal effort), and you've got one delicious appetizer or snack on your hands... or rather, you've

"078052","Pad See Ew","An indisputable icon of Thai restaurant menus and street food stalls the world over, pad see ew translates 
to ""fried with soy sauce,"" and was likely popularized within Thailand by Chinese immigrants in the early 
20th century. A bit like a localized, Thai-cuisine-informed variation of chow fun (which was likely a direct 
inspiration), pad see ew is traditionally made with wide, flat rice noodles, which are fried in a wok with various 
veggies and garlic before being finished with a splash of light and dark soy sauce to give it a bold, savory, and 
umami-rich flavor. And that's the same, time-tested technique that our supplier in Thailand uses when making 
Trader Joe's Pad See Ew, a rich, flavorful, and totally vegan version of this classic dish that's now available in 
our freezers.

After mere minutes in the microwave, Trader Joe's Pad See Ew makes an excellent work lunch, dinner entrée, 
or savory side dish. Every bite expresses a delightful depth of flavor, as well as a remarkable range of textures, 
from the tender chewiness of the noodles, to the snap of the carrots and Chinese broccoli, to the soft, tooth-
sink-ability of the tofu chunks and tofu sheets. We recommend serving it alongside our (also vegan) Thai Green 
Curry [sku 70789], some fluffy jasmine rice, and a plate of stir-fried Baby Bok Choy [sku 98253].

TJ's Tangerine Cream Bars [sku 69861] and TJ's Blueberry Dream Bars [sku 74250]. Normally, Trader Joe's 
Mango & Cream Bars [sku 92373] (available year-round) would have been part of this polar produce party-
except our Australian supplier announced earlier this year that they were unable to keep up, after more than a 
dozen years of meeting our mango bar demand. Without skipping a beat we sought a new supplier, this time, 
closer to home. We also took the opportunity to make some minor improvements before presenting our latest 
Mango Cream Bars.

Flavor-wise, these are similar to the previous iteration-a combination of creamy vanilla and sweet-tart mango. 
What sticks out here as different is... the stick. (Previous version was sans stick.) And rather than the flavors 
existing side-by-side, in this version, the creamy vanilla ice cream is entirely surrounded by sweet, fruity mango 
sorbet. It's the same format as our Tangerine Cream Bars, only with Mango.

You might also find that Trader Joe's Mango Cream Bars are a bit richer overall. That's because the first 
ingredient is vanilla ice cream (it was water in the original version). Plus, the fruity part is made with purée of 
both Magdalena and Alphonso mango varieties, delivering a tart & sweet, totally tropical taste!

with friends, although... hitting the home ""bar"" with some appetizers from TJ's has its perks. Besides not 
needing to leave your house, and saving money on tips, you also get the opportunity to enjoy tasty appetizers 
from our freezers, like Trader Joe's Crispy Battered Calamari.

We worked with seafood specialists in Italy to develop our own version of the classic Italian Anelli alla 
Romana (""Roman Rings""). Our Calamari is made with squid rings and tentacles that are lightly battered with 
a combination of wheat flour, rice semolina, and baking soda. This helps develop a Crispy crunch during 
cooking in your conventional oven or air fryer. And they're seasoned with salt, black pepper, garlic, onion, and 
chili pepper; just the right amount of flavor to enjoy as-is, or with a simple squeeze of fresh lemon juice. 

Of course, dipping these Crispy Battered squid into your favorite TJ's sauce (we have so many!) adds yet 
another layer of deliciousness. You'll find 16-ounce packages of Trader Joe's Crispy Battered Calamari every 
day in our freezers. Keep some in your freezer, for the next time you and your friends decide to have a happy

true soft spot for the bao bun-and for its soft and pillowy texture, in particular. That, combined with its mild, 
delicately savory, and just a touch sweet flavor, makes the bao bun an especially compelling conveyance for 
hearty proteins and aromatic sauces, as Trader Joe's Mini Shrimp Bao rather deliciously demonstrate. Made 
for us by an expert supplier in Vietnam, each box contains eight miniature, clamshell-style Bao laden with a 
well-seasoned shrimp patty, as well as a sweet and sticky lemongrass, lime, and chili sauce for dipping.

Excellent as an appetizer, hors d'oeuvre, or side dish, Trader Joe's Mini Shrimp Bao offer a marvelous medley of 
complementary flavors and textures in every bite. Individually, each Bao takes less than a minute to microwave, 
and when prepped together, only a few minutes in the steamer before they're tender, tasty, and ready to serve. 
They can be enjoyed as they are, right out of the box, or, if you prefer, dressed to your liking; we're partial to 
garnishing each Bao with quick-pickled cucumber ribbons, shredded carrots, and freshly torn cilantro leaves.

style seafood boil. There's the remarkable range of flavors, the ingenuity of ingredients, and, of course, the 
overall emphasis on community-what else can bring people together like a big batch of fiery-hot shellfish, 
after all? In honor of this storied (not to mention well-spiced) tradition, we're bringing in Trader Joe's Seafood 
Boil to our freezers. Each box contains a bag of shrimp, tilapia, clams, and andouille sausage, along with hearty 
corn on the cob and miniature potatoes, all pre-seasoned with a lip-smackingly spicy garlic butter sauce. Ça 
c'est bon, non?

Once home, your Trader Joe's Seafood Boil can be conveniently prepped by either boiling it all in-bag, or 
by placing the contents of the bag in a sauce pan and heating until cooked through. Either way, in about 20-
25 minutes, you'll have a spicy, buttery, Cajun-style seafood and veggie medley ready to be served. It makes 
an excellent and practically effortless weeknight dinner option, especially considering each bag contains two 
hearty servings. We recommend pairing your Seafood Boil with an Everyday Butter Lettuce Salad [sku 74072] 
and some white rice or crusty bread to soak up as much of that garlicky, buttery sauce as you can.

the store in a shelf-stable package and only need to be frozen overnight before they're ready to enjoy. Unlike 
those freezer pops of the past, however, ours are certified Organic and contain 100% juice!

Inside each package, you'll find ten Pops in three fantastic flavors: three sweet and citric Orange Pops, three 
rich and refreshing Berry Pops, and four tart and tangy Cherry Limeade Pops. An excellent anytime sweet treat 
for kids and adults alike, Trader Joe's Organic Freezer Pops make an especially nice bit of refreshment for 
enjoying after school, sports practices, and other outdoor activities. Once you take them home, we recommend 
giving them a quick shake before freezing-since they're made with real fruit juice concentrates, this will help 
reduce any natural separation that may occur as the juices inside each Pop settle.

Mango Mochi was¿ well, inevitable. And you wouldn't be wrong-our Buyer had Mango on her mind from 
the moment she was charged with the task of creating our next, limited-edition Mochi flavor.

Like our everyday Mochi options (Vanilla [sku 64500], Green Tea [sku 64669], & Strawberry [sku 64499]), 
Trader Joe's Mango Mochi are essentially one-or-two-bite-sized scoops of sweet-tart Mango ice cream,

absolutely take the time to savor every bite of this Cheesecake's tantalizingly tart cream cheese base, flavored 
with lemon curd and actual bits of lemon peel, as well as its dense, crumbly, gingersnap crust. 

Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is an excellent dessert option for bringing along to cookouts, serving to friends

determined person you are. ""Now, now,"" you might be saying, ""surely, such a rich and decadent Cheesecake

inch-diameter, 30-ounce Trader Joe's Lemon Ginger Cheesecake sells for about the same price you'd pay - or 
less! - for a single slice of cheesecake at a bakery or restaurant, making it an eminently affordable indulgence.

"077908","Super Strawberry Sorbet","We didn't just name our brand-new sorbet flavor ""Super Strawberry Sorbet,"" for the alliteration. (Although, 
it is fun to say.) In fact, we called it super because we think that's the best word to describe Trader Joe's latest, 
fruity, frozen treat! Even beyond the ""super-fruit"" status of strawberries, this Sorbet has other superb qualities 
going for it. Our supplier in Thailand starts with locally harvested strawberries that have a balanced, sweet & tart 
flavor, which translates sensationally when blended with water & cane sugar to form the smooth Sorbet base. 
Then, they add Strawberry pieces to amp up the texture and augment the Super Strawberry flavor. 

We're confident that anyone who gets their hands on (and their spoons in) Trader Joe's Super Strawberry 
Sorbet is going to love it. In particular, those who avoid animal products will definitely be assigning superlatives 
to this vegan dessert. But you can't love it if you never try it... so grab a pint from our freezers while supplies last!

products in our stores, including Trader Joe's Not Your Average Salsa Verde Chicken Enchiladas.

The qualities that make these Enchiladas beyond average are found in every aspect of their construction. 
Tender, brothy, dark-chicken meat has been shredded and tucked into two corn tortillas in ample quantities. 
Side-by-side, the Chicken Enchiladas are generously covered with a flavorful Salsa Verde that's green with 
tomatillos, poblano chilis, and jalapeño peppers. The final tasty touch is a sprinkling of diced peppers and 
some melty (once heated) mozzarella. Speaking of heating, about the only thing one could say is average about 
these Enchiladas is the fact that you conveniently cook them in either a microwave or a conventional oven.

But back to the extraordinary: each 16.5-ounce package (that's over a pound!) of Trader Joe's Not Your Average

delicious) yes! So, if it's not meat, what is it? We're glad you asked. These Meatless Meatballs are expertly 
crafted from textured soy protein (TSP)-which is what remains after extracting the oil from soybeans. It's 
""textured"" because it has the appearance & mouthfeel of meat. It's ""protein"" because it naturally contains a 
notable amount of protein-13g of protein per 4-Meatball serving.

Our Meatless Meatballs are also delicious, since the TSP is seasoned like the best Italian-style meatballs, using 
a combination of onions, garlic powder, parsley, basil, sea salt, and black pepper-plus mushroom powder, for 
an umami-boost. The seasoned soy protein is then formed into couple-bite sized rounds, which are flash frozen 
so they're at-the-ready whenever the urge for Meatballs hits. And when it does hit, you can quickly heat these  
kosher, vegan, Meatless morsels using a variety of convenient methods (detailed on the package). In a matter 
of just 4 to 14 minutes-depending on your approach-you'll have savory, tender, Meatless Meatballs that

Soufflé Cheesecakes are an easy, no-mess dessert option for evenings (or afternoons) when being tethered to

estimate that this hearty, handheld dish has likely been a staple of Korean cuisine for thousands of years. Now a 
rising star in the global street food scene, jumeokbap can be made with any number of fillings and seasonings, 
and can be enjoyed in all manner of contexts: as a quick, on-the-go bite, as a side with a larger meal, or as a 
miniature meal all its own. Made for us by a supplier in the Republic of Korea, Trader Joe's Jumeokbap are 
flavored with a mix of plant-based bulgogi and savory-seasoned vegetables, and take only about a minute in 
the microwave to go from frozen to soft, steamy, and ready-to-eat.

Traditionally, jumeokbap are spherical, reflecting the shape of a closed fist. Trader Joe's Jumeokbap are a little 
more pyramidal, making them a kind of vegan mashup of jumeokbap and Japanese onigiri. We recommend 
them as a hearty snack when you're feeling peckish between meals, and we especially recommend serving them 
with a sauce for dipping. Try pairing a Jumeokbap or two with a bit of our Gyoza Dipping Sauce [sku 84399],

"074951","Shrimp Scampi","Shrimp, garlic, butter, lemon, and white wine. The ingredients to a classic shrimp scampi feel so made for one 
another, so iconic in their expression of flavor when combined, that it's somewhat shocking to realize that the 
dish is only about a century old. In fact, when it was invented in Italy during the 1920s, it was simply known 
as ""scampi,"" and featured langoustine lobster, rather than shrimp. As delicious as that certainly was, we're glad 
to be living in the era of the modern shrimp scampi we all know and love-an era which now includes the 
consummately convenient and phenomenally flavorful Trader Joe's Shrimp Scampi, available in our freezers.

Made with a recipe inspired by this staple of Italian-American cuisine, each package is made with shelled, 
deveined, tail-off shrimp in a rich, flavorful, and enchantingly aromatic sauce made with garlic, butter, white 
wine, lemon juice, and a bit of grated Romano cheese for an extra touch of umami oomph. It cooks quickly and 
easily on the stovetop or in the oven, after which it can be served with pasta, rice, crusty bread, or entirely on its 
own. We like our Shrimp Scampi as a simple, satisfying, no-fuss entrée for a busy weeknight dinner, especially 
when paired with a side of roasted broccoli, a baked potato, and a crisp and fruity white wine-something like

"077729","Kimbap","Known in Korea as gimbap, from gim for ""seaweed"" and bap for ""cooked rice,"" kimbap is similar to-but 
decidedly distinct from-a mega-sized maki sushi roll. Whereas maki is typically made with vinegar-seasoned 
rice and focuses on one filling (like a single variety of vegetable or fish), kimbap is made with sesame oil-seasoned 
rice, and can contain all kinds of combinations of savory fillings. Trader Joe's Kimbap, for example, takes a 
veggie-forward approach. Our supplier, a kimbap expert in the Republic of Korea, arranges an assortment of 
sauteed greens, crunchy root vegetables, and crisp pickles around a base of braised tofu, wraps it all in a layer 
of rice and seaweed, then slices it into two-or-three-bite-sized rounds.

When viewed in cross section, our conveniently quick-cooking Kimbap resembles a marvelous, multi-flavored 
mosaic. After cooking from frozen for a mere two minutes in the microwave, it can be enjoyed hot or chilled, 
served as an entrée, side, or snack. While it's flavorful enough to hold its own as a dish, it also accessorizes well 
with a bit of Sriracha [sku 50828], Gochujang Sauce [sku 74565], or Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce [sku 26426]. For 
an even more satisfying textural dimension, we recommend giving each piece a quick pan-fry: two minutes in

"075062","Mini Chocolate Chip Croissant Swirls","The word croissant is French for ""crescent,"" describing the classic, moon-sliver shape of these buttery, baked 
delights. But croissants can come in many shapes, as evidenced by Trader Joe's Mini Chocolate Chip Croissant 
Swirls.

In these Mini Croissants, the crescent is superseded by the Swirl. Our French bakery supplier starts with 
familiar croissant construction, using layers upon layers of thin, wheat-flour dough, alternating with layers 
of cultured butter. The dough is then rolled into long cylinders, which are cut into discs resembling spiral 
galaxies, if you will. And a generous sprinkling of semi-sweet Chocolate Chips are the stars of these systems. 

Our Ready-to-Bake Mini Croissant Swirls go directly from freezer to oven; no proofing required. Simply 
allow the frozen Swirls to rest at room temperature on a parchment-lined baking sheet for as long as it takes to 
pre-heat your oven to 350°F, pop them in, and 25-30 minutes later you'll be over the moon for golden brown, 
crisp & flaky pastries, studded with a constellation of melty, chocolatey Chips. You'll find 8.5-ounce packages 
of eight, Trader Joe's Mini Chocolate Chip Croissant Swirls in our freezers, every day.

"077555","Dulce de Leche Ice Cream","While some desserts are awesomely ornate in their construction, dulce de leche is sublimely simple: on the most 
fundamental level, all it requires to make is milk, sugar, and the patience to let it slowly simmer until it thickens 
to a caramelized texture, color, and taste. And yet, despite its superlatively simple setup, dulce de leche has an 
undeniable depth of flavor, combining the richness of condensed milk with the sweetness of caramel. That's 
why we find it's an ideal flavor for our latest seasonal ice cream pint. In the spirit of such inspired simplicity, we 
invite you to enjoy this captivatingly creamy and caramelly Trader Joe's Dulce de Leche Ice Cream.

It's made especially for us by a trusted ice cream supplier, who starts with a base of creamy caramel ice cream, 
then adds a smooth, silky, and satisfyingly sweet swirl of milky, Dulce de Leche-style caramel. This double 
Dulce approach ensures that every spoonful is remarkably rich and full-flavored. And while we find that it 
more than stands on its own when enjoyed in a simple cup or cone, you may wish to take things to the next 
level by using it to make your own sundae, banana split, or milkshake.

mainstay in our freezer case. More specifically, it's our take on takikomi gohan, a traditional Japanese style of 
rice flavored with soy sauce and mirin (a tangy rice wine). Our version contains shelled edamame, pieces of 
deep fried tofu, and thin strips of hijiki seaweed. What's inside the package you'll find in our freezers is fully 
cooked-you can heat it in minutes in a microwave or skillet or wok-and works brilliantly as either a side with 
a larger Japanese-inspired meal or as the main dish for a vegetarian feast. You could also go the fusion route and 
serve it topped with Sriracha and a fried egg. (#putaneggonit) You'll find it alongside the other fried rice options

"090809","Korean Style Beef Short Ribs","Here's a quick dinner idea we think will really excite you! Trader Joe's Korean Style Beef Short Ribs. It's a 
simple entrée, really - lean beef short ribs marinated in a Korean style sweet and savory soy-based marinade. 
In the marinade, soy sauce and garlic account for the Ribs savory flavors, then brown sugar is added to make 
it deliciously sweet. The combination is simple, yet phenomenal. 

The genius is really in the preparation, and that's where you come in. In about 15 minutes (if you count the 
time it takes to thaw the meat), these simple Short Ribs cook to utter perfection - just pop them on a grill 
- or grill pan on the stovetop - at medium-high heat, cook for a couple of minutes on each side and, you're 
done. See? Genius! Before devouring, the Beef should be cooked thoroughly, at 160 degrees Fahrenheit or 
higher measured by a food thermometer. You'll find each 20-ounce package of Korean Style Beef Short Ribs 
containing five short ribs in our freezers.

"052591","Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings","It wasn't that long ago that the wings of a chicken were regarded as parts to be discarded. But, in an 
unexpected turnover, the chicken wing has intercepted the top spot for beloved bar nosh and ubiquitous 
sports-watching snacks. Now, Trader Joe's brings our own version of wings to the table (or bar top). Our new 
Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings have a list of stats that will make it hard-if not impossible-to catch a game 
without wanting them close-at-hand. 

Here's what makes our Wings soar above local pub grub: First, they come from vegetarian chickens. That 
means our California-grown birds are raised on a balanced diet of corn and soybean meal. They are never 
fed animal fat or animal by-products. Second, our Wings are 100% antibiotic-free (ABF). This is especially 
notable, since Trader Joe's is currently the only retailer selling completely ABF, hot and spicy wings. Third, our 
Wings are super easy to prepare. They've been fully cooked and promptly frozen. This means they're ready to 
heat at a moment's notice, in the microwave or conventional oven.

Like the original Buffalo wings, ours are ""sectioned"" (cut in half), and covered in a spicy sauce made from 
vinegar, cayenne peppers, and chile pepper extract. These bite- (or three) sized snacks are the perfect finger-
food. Spray canola oil on your baking tray for extra-crispy wings. And, be sure to have some cool dip at the 
ready. Try our Low-Fat Parmesan Ranch [sku 17784], or our Greek Style Feta Dressing [sku 93244] as the 
perfect foil for the spicy, vinegary sauce-with a handful of Cut & Peeled Baby Carrots [sku 70588] on the side.

Each 16-ounce (1-pound) bag of our Hot & Spicy Chicken Wings is $5.99. Move some down the field-from 
our freezer to yours-and you'll be primed for the next big game!

"075234","Chiles Rellenos con Queso","A much-beloved mainstay of Mexican cuisine, the chile relleno is a masterclass of complementary flavors and 
textures: each bite manages to combine the gooeyness of melted cheese, the tenderness of a fire-roasted pepper, 
and the crispiness of its egg-battered exterior, all at once. Of course, a dish with such a delightfully complex 
eating experience usually results from an equally complex cooking experience, and one doesn't always have the 
time to fire-roast, stuff, batter, and fry a whole pepper. That's what makes Trader Joe's Chiles Rellenos Con 
Queso so convenient-now, having a hearty chile relleno at home is simply a matter of letting it cook in the 
microwave, air fryer, or conventional oven, heating the included zesty tomato sauce on the stove or microwave, 
combining, and enjoying.

An always-excellent entrée or appetizer, our frozen Chiles Rellenos make an especially great vegetarian option 
for a weeknight dinner or weekend lunch. For a quick and easy meal, try pairing them with a side of rice and 
beans, which will also help soak up the rich and flavorful sauce. Of course, if you're feeling extra hungry, you 
can always use one as the filling for a super satisfying burrito, along with some diced tomatoes, onions, and our 
Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole [sku 71498].

"076125","Papas Rellenas","An essential element of countless cuisines across Latin America and the Caribbean, the papa rellena might just 
be the ideal comfort food. While exact recipes vary, region to region, they're typically made by stuffing savory-
seasoned ground beef into a ball of mashed potatoes, which is then rolled in breadcrumbs and fried until 
it's crispy, golden brown, and mouthwateringly delicious. On paper, it sounds a little like a spicier, appetizer 
version of a shepherd's pie. As Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas ably demonstrate, on the palate, it's so much more. 

Drawing inspiration from the Cuban variation of this classic, comfy croquette, Trader Joe's Papas Rellenas are 
made with a picadillo-esque filling of ground beef, diced onions and bell peppers, along with a lively blend of 
herbs and seasonings like garlic, oregano, and black pepper. Each package contains four Papas Rellenas, which 
crisp up beautifully in either the conventional oven or the air fryer, after which they're ready to be enjoyed as 
an hors d'oeuvre, snack, or side, with a tart, creamy, or spicy dipping sauce. Or, if you prefer, they also make an 
excellent entrée-prepare a few Papas Rellenas per person, then serve on a plate with Spanish Style Rice [sku 
73936], Organic Black Beans [sku 50262], and your favorite TJ's salad kit.

"075249","Spicy Meat Pizza","Meat lovers, rejoice-it's time to meet-za the pizza of your dreams! Made for us in Italy by one of our favorite 
pizza partners, Trader Joe's Spicy Meat Pizza starts like all good pizzas do: with high-quality dough. Our 
supplier leaves the dough to proof for a full 24 hours, then hand-stretches it into roughly 10-inch crusts. Each 
crust is then topped with an umami-rich tomato sauce (made with a bit of Balsamic vinegar to deepen its 
flavor), shredded mozzarella cheese, and a top-tier trio of tasty toppings: spicy smoked sausage, savory pork 
meatballs, and grilled red bell peppers. 

The Calabrian-recipe sausage is arguably the star of the show here. It eats a bit like an Italian chorizo and 
really brings chili-pepper heat; the meatballs add even more umami, and the grilled bell peppers lend some 
sweetness to this pleasantly balanced pie. All told, TJ's Spicy Meat Pizza is the kind of simple yet elegant 
pie you'd find at a charming Italian pizzeria¿ except you'll find this Pizza pie in the freezers, only at your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"057186","Chocolate Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones","When we first introduced our Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones back in 2011 [skus 95433 & 95434], they 
were an instant hit with our customers. Who could resist these adorably miniature and satisfyingly indulgent 
little Cones? Very few, it seemed. Very few. But at Trader Joe's, we are always interested in improving upon a good 
thing-so last year, our buyer set out to see if we could ""build a better cone,"" as it were. As it would turn out, we 
could. And we did.

Our new Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones begin with a crispier, crunchier cone, lined with fine European-
sourced and U.S.-made chocolate; the chocolate is notably richer and more flavorful than in our previous 
incarnation. Next, these mini, chocolate-lined treasures are piped full of thick, creamy Chocolate ice cream. The 
Ice Cream our new vendor makes is so deliciously dense because it contains only around 50% overrun (that's ice 
cream lingo for the amount of air whipped into the ice cream to expand its volume), which is impressive when 
you consider that most ice cream used in frozen novelties contains around 90% overrun. Finally, the Cones are 
dipped-upside down, no less!-in more of that fine, fine chocolate. 

Snatch a Mini Cone (or three) out of the freezer whenever your sweet tooth calls-at under 100 calories each, they 
are easily worth the indulgence. If you're in the mood to share, serve these Mini Ice Cream Cones at parties-
they're perfect for a simple-but-highly-Instagram-able baby shower, birthday party, graduation banquet, etc. 
Plus, they're an incredible value. We've increased the overall weight of the product by a third (from 5.9 to 7.89 
ounces, to be exact), but we haven't increased the price-each box of 8 Mini Chocolate Ice Cream Cones is still 
just $2.99. You'll find them along with their Vanilla [sku 57185] counterparts in our freezers.

"098265","4 Almond Croissants","Getting right to the point, and throwing modesty out the window, Trader Joe's 4 Almond Croissants are 
extraordinary. We thought it would be a bit presumptuous to put ""extraordinary"" on the label, though we think 
you'll agree that they're extraordinary on every level. To begin, while they require a soupçon of forethought, 
they're super-simple. Just remove from the package, place on a baking sheet and thaw overnight. They'll rise as 
they thaw - for the uninitiated, this is ""proofing."" When you wake in the morning, simply bake them in your 
oven for about 20 minutes. The dough is buttery and bakes to a crispy-on-the-outside, flaky-chewy on the 
inside finish. They're filled with sweet almond paste and topped with almond flakes. In other words, if you're 
an almond lover, you're in for a real treat! 

Freshly baked almond croissants of this quality might cost you $5-$6 each in a bakery. Or you could order 
a mail order version and spend a week's salary (only kind of joking). Or you could buy a box of 4 Almond 
Croissants at Trader Joe's for about what you'd pay for a single bakery croissant. You'll find them in our freezers.

"091087","4 Chocolate Croissants","Like their carb cousins the brioche and Danish pastry, croissants belong to a family of baked goods collectively 
referred to as viennoiseries, baked goods made with yeast-leavened, laminated dough that's enriched with eggs, 
butter, or milk. They first arrived in France by way of Austria in the late 1800's, and are now ubiquitous in French 
bakery culture, their glossy, flaky crust and tender crumb a mainstay of breakfast and snacktime. While flavor 
variations run the gamut from sweet to savory, the pain au chocolat, or chocolate croissant, is the preferred 
variation of many a pastry connoisseur-this is just one of the many reasons why Trader Joe's Chocolate 
Croissants have become a mainstay of our frozen cases.

Made with creamy butter and filled with rich, semisweet Belgian chocolate, Trader Joe's Chocolate Croissants 
bring high-end bakery quality to your home kitchen with minimal effort. Remove them from the package and 
let them proof overnight (just as a French bakery would); in the morning you'll find the Croissants have nearly 
tripled in size! Brush with an egg wash, then bake 20-25 minutes until the Croissants are a deep golden brown. 
Let them rest for 10 minutes (distract yourself by brewing a pot of TJ's French Vanilla Coffee [sku 51484]), and 
then prepare to delight in the gooey melted Chocolate and warm, flaky Croissant dough. Yummmmm. 

Each 12-ounce box contains four ready-to-proof-and-bake Chocolate Croissants, so you can bake a bunch for 
brunch, or savor them one by one as a weekday breakfast or snack. You'll find them in the freezer cases at your

"050378","Vegetable Bird's Nests","Perhaps you've heard of those edible bird's nests that are a delicacy in parts of Asia. Aside from being cost 
prohibitive (they can be up to $3,000 per pound!), and also being difficult to procure in the States, the idea of 
eating an actual nest constructed by birds is not all that palatable to most eaters outside those cultures. But what 
about the idea of ""nests"" made of vegetables?

Trader Joe's Vegetable Bird's Nests are indeed popular wtihin the Customer culture of TJ's. We've offered 
them since 2003! Vegetable Bird's Nests are a combination of julienned onions and carrots with chopped kale 
that have been loosely woven together and then fried in tempura batter. Once you reheat these fully cooked 
Nests from frozen (in the conventional oven or with a quick re-fry in oil), you'll have an artistic appetizer to

"054988","Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings","Soup goes in a bowl or in a cup-unless, of course, you are a fan of Xiao Long Bao. Then, your soup goes in a 
dumpling. Trader Joe's Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings are a wonder to behold, both for their display of 
Chinese food innovation, and for their incredibly comforting flavor profile. 

This concept originates in the Jiangnan region of southeastern China, where Shanghai is situated. Xiao Long 
Bao are essentially soup dumplings, but instead of dumplings that go in the soup (though you can still certainly 
make this happen), the soup actually goes inside these dumplings. Our expert Chinese dumpling supplier forms 
their wheat flour dumpling dough with a specially formulated proprietary production method that seals each 
dumpling, allowing them to hold the maximum amount of savory broth-broth made from ingredients includ-
ing chicken, onion, green onion, soy sauce, and ginger. Once the soup is wrapped in the dough and sealed (Bao 
means ""wrapped"" in Chinese), it is steamed until fully cooked (Xiao Long refers to a traditional Chinese bamboo 
steamer). Lastly, our dumplings are put into microwave-safe packages and frozen so we can deliver them to you.

To enjoy, you simply cut the corner of the bag and microwave for 1 to 2 minutes. Let your Dumplings sit for at 
least another minute before removing from microwave. The insides will be very hot, so be careful! We suggest 
placing a hot Soup Dumpling on a deep Chinese soup spoon and nibbling a little hole in the side to let the soup 
run out before enjoying soup and dumpling together.

You get six large Chicken Soup Dumplings in each six ounce package for $2.99. With Trader Joe's, the soup's 
not only on-it's IN! ¿ in our Dumplings and in our freezers, everyday.

Trader Giotto's Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza is loaded with roasted eggplant, zucchini, red onion, grilled 
yellow and red peppers, and garlic. By ""roasted,"" we don't mean they were briefly passed over a flame to make 
them look charred. Our supplier near Bologna, Italy has really roasted these vegetables until they achieved their 
inviting look and taste. And rather than dicing them, they've chopped these veggies in longer strips to provide 
more textural interest for your tongue and the more distinguishable flavor from bite to bite. These colorful, plen-
tiful vegetables sit atop a crisp and chewy sourdough crust (made from a long-rise dough) that is spread with a 
well-seasoned tomato sauce and sprinkled with a blend of mozzarella and hard aged cheese. The taste-experience 
alone is enough to make you forget about pepperoni-at least for a few minutes. 

In addition to the great flavor-combination, this pizza really stands out for its Organic attribute. There are 
many frozen pizzas on the market that claim to be ""made with some organic ingredients,"" but very few that are 
like ours. From dough to sauce to cheese to veggies, Trader Giotto's Roasted Vegetable Pizza is wholly Or-
ganic-100%. 

This frozen pie bakes up in your 425ºF oven in just 12-15 minutes at a cost that, like our ingredients, includes 
no unnecessary additives. $4.49 puts this 16.08-ounce Organic Roasted Vegetable Pizza in your hands-and 
shortly thereafter, in your mouth. So go ahead... Eat your vegetables!

"075759","Spaghetti Carbonara","Within the vast continuum of comfort foods, pasta dishes are often among the most comforting. And within 
that subset of comfort foods, carbonara may just be the queen. Rich, creamy, and satisfying, with plenty of 
savory cheese and smoky pancetta (do we really need to say any more after that?), a great carbonara can lift 
moods, nourish spirits, and leave one feeling consummately cozy and content. Brought to us by a supplier in 
Italy, Trader Joe's Spaghetti Carbonara is, indeed, a great carbonara, made even greater by its remarkable 
value and effortless method of preparation.

Once brought home, from our freezers into yours, all this Carbonara needs is a few minutes in the microwave

textured, from the al dente bite of the spaghetti to the savoriness of the egg, Grana Padano, and Pecorino 
Romano-based sauce, to the toothsomeness of the tender, diced pancetta. It makes an excellent (not to mention 
effortless) dinner option, whether it's enjoyed as a well planned out feast with garlic bread, stuffed mushrooms, 
and grilled zucchini, or a last-minute meal combined with one of our super quick salad kits.

"078576","French Vanilla Ice Cream","Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream is a super premium vanilla ice cream that talks the talk - we don't mean French; 
we mean the language of flavor! Our rich French Vanilla Ice Cream has an unmistakably creamy-custard texture that 
can be enjoyed plain or used as a companion for any combination of cookies, candies, and chocolates.

What makes a quart of French vanilla ice cream ""French"", you ask? It has nothing to do with the vanilla bean itself 
(which is only grown near the equator, not near France at all); it merely means that the ice cream begins with a base 
that contains egg yolks, unlike regular vanilla ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice Cream is made in this French 
tradition, which ultimately lends a pale-yellow color and a richer, smoother consistency than traditional vanilla ice cream.  
Notice that super premium designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one 
gallon of mix would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's French Vanilla Ice 
Cream has 26% overrun - aka dense, super SUPER premium ice cream! We're selling each one quart container of French

"077035","Calamansi & Mango Sorbet","Drawing inspiration from two fundamental fruits within the culinary canon of the Philippines, Trader Joe's 
Calamansi & Mango Sorbet is a tangy, velvety, and remarkably refreshing frozen dessert (that just happens to 
be totally vegan). Combining the bracingly bright and tart tones of Calamansi (a lime-like citrus fruit native 
to the Philippines) with the lush, tropical flavors of Mango (the national fruit of the Philippines, no less!), each 
spoonful of this seasonal Sorbet is beautifully balanced between its sweet and sour elements. 

Give Trader Joe's Calamansi & Mango Sorbet a try as a palate-cleanser between bites of a creamy brie or blue 
cheese on a charcuterie board. Savor it as a dessert after a hearty meal of well-seasoned Salmon [sku 24455] 
and Shishito Peppers [sku 54163]. Or just enjoy it by the pint-ful, while watching a movie or catching up on 
your shows. Whatever you do, be sure to pick some up soon-supply is limited, and at this price, it's sure to go

"075929","Kanom Krok Thai Coconut Pancakes","Thai coconut-rice pancakes, or kanom krok, are among the most popular street foods in Thailand. If you've 
been fortunate enough to visit Thailand and try one (or several) of these dome-shaped, two-bite-sized treats for 
yourself, you can certainly understand why. And even if your travels haven't yet taken you to Thailand, you're 
in luck, because Trader Joe's Thai Coconut Pancakes are bringing this delicacy straight to your freezer! 

Following an authentic recipe, Trader Joe's Thai Coconut Pancakes are made for us in Thailand from a simple, 
straightforward batter of coconut milk, rice flour, cane & coconut sugars, tapioca starch, rice bran oil, and a 
bit of sea salt. Our supplier pours the batter into an indented pan (think muffin-tin-meets-cast-iron-deviled-
egg-plate), adds some shredded young coconut and taro root, then bakes it until the Pancakes are crisp on the 
outside and custardy on the inside. Preparation on your end couldn't be easier: simply remove the Pancakes' 
packaging, heat them in an air-fryer for 7-8 minutes (or  in the microwave for 50-60 seconds), and enjoy a 
sweet & salty taste of Thailand.

and some are hot and spicy. And some, like Trader Joe's Jalapeño & Cream Cheese Crispy Wontons, manage 
to be all of those at once-and more! They're made with a marvelously rich mix of tangy cream cheese, savory 
Parmesan, and diced jalapeño, which is then wrapped in a wonton skin and fried until bubbly and golden 
brown. A little like a mix between a rangoon and jalapeño popper, every bite of these captivatingly Crispy 
Wontons is superbly savory, pleasantly spicy, and most of all, totally satisfying.

No need to bring out the deep fryer or heat a whole pot of oil, either: these Wontons go from frozen to crispy 
and delicious in just about 10 minutes in a conventional oven, or a little more than half that in an air fryer. 
Once cooked, they're ready to be served for all kinds of occasions: try them as an easy starter for a quick stir-
fry dinner, an hors d'oeuvre for a cocktail night with friends, or as a super flavorful snack when folks for over 
for the big game. Wherever and whenever you have them, just be sure to pair them with a bit of our Sweet Chili

"076298","Garlic Shiitake Green Beans","Side-dish ideas are sometimes put on the back burner while we spend the majority of our menu-planning 
on main dishes. Thankfully, your neighborhood Trader Joe's offers scores of sides that are both delicious and 
ready to enjoy in just minutes-no planning required. Trader Joe's Garlic Shiitake Green Beans is an excellent 
example.

Our supplier in Thailand, who also makes our Lightly Salted Edamame [sku 51063], knows a thing or two 
about preparing high-quality, frozen legumes. In this case, they start with Thai-grown green beans, par-cook 
them, and season them with a seriously umami-licious, soy-based sauce that's amped up with garlic & shiitake 
mushrooms. The dish is flash-frozen, packaged, and delivered to our stores, where you can pick it up any day 
of the week. 

Getting these Garlic Shiitake Green Beans ready for their supporting supper role is a swift, five-minute affair. 
It requires just a quick sauté & steam on the stovetop-or a handful of microwave minutes. The still-firm beans, 
with their garlic-forward flavor and delicious mushroom undertones, pair well with Trader Joe's Beef Bulgogi 
[sku 75283] and your favorite TJ's rice... but there are many more mains that would be happy to call this savory 
bean dish their sidekick!

"095249","Baingan Bharta","Our latest foray into the world of frozen entrées inspired by Indian cuisine combines the mild, slightly 
sweet flavor and creamy consistency of roasted eggplant with aromatic alliums like onion and garlic, savory 
seasonings like turmeric and fenugreek leaves, and a nice level of heat, courtesy of fresh green chili peppers. 
Hearty, flavorful, and satisfying, each bite of Trader Joe's Baingan Bharta  is layered with a pleasantly complex 
mix of tastes and textures. And though the eating experience may be complex, our take on this iconic Punjabi 
vegetarian dish (also known in some parts of the world as baigan chokha) is surprisingly simple to prepare: just 
heat, serve, and enjoy.

Our Baingan Bharta makes an excellent (and effortless) lunch or dinner option when enjoyed entirely on its 
own, and an even better entrée when served over Basmati Rice [sku 25880] as part of a larger meal. Speaking of 
which, we find that it's especially suited for pairing with a nice Naan [sku 77677] or other warm flatbread, for 
scooping. And to add an extra dimension of creaminess (and temper the heat of the green chili peppers, too), 
we recommend topping it with a dollop of Plain Greek Yogurt [69707].

we've been in that camp ourselves on more than one occasion - we did, after all, label it a Tarte.  However, upon 
close inspection (requiring careful tasting, of course), there is no denying that Tarte aux Champignons is a 
pizza of the highest order.  

Our Tarte aux Champignons starts with a thin, crisp, crust with hand-braided edges, topped with crème 
fraîche and a luxuriously rich Emmental cheese sauce.  But wait, we're just getting started.  The stars of this tarte 
are the 'shrooms-white mushrooms and oyster mushrooms-and they're here in abundance.  Bursting with 
intense, woody, earthy, flavors , the fungi elevate this flatbread to its deserved level of distinction.  A dusting 
of Parmesan  Reggiano cheese balances the flavors to perfection.  Sliced into easy-to-carry pieces, it's a perfect 
appetizer for parties; paired with a simple salad, it's an exquisite dinner for two.  Whether you choose to call it 
a flatbread, a pizza, or a tarte, you can bring home its swoon-inducing flavors for the tremendous value price 
of $3.99 for each 9.52 ounce Tarte.

"075639","Tofu Sheets","Trader Joe's Tofu Sheets aren't technically tofu-at least not in the traditional sense. They're what's known 
throughout Asia as yuba, a.k.a. the delicate ""tofu skin"" that forms atop soy milk when heated on a stovetop. Like 
tofu, yuba is incredibly mild and takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked with, making Trader Joe's Tofu 
Sheets the perfect protein to add to everything from curries and stir-fries to soups and stews.

Made for us in Malaysia, Trader Joe's Tofu Sheets are the very same sheets used in our perennially popular 
Vegan Thai Green Curry [sku 70789]. The Sheets come conveniently frozen; simply cut the corner of the pouch 
they come in, then heat it in the microwave for 2¿ minutes, and you're ready to rock 'n roll. (And we do mean

"075756","Tortilla Española","In contrast to the corn and flour tortillas of Mesoamerican and Mexican cuisine, a Spanish tortilla (also known 
as a Spanish omelette) is more akin to a hearty frittata. Typically made from a mix of eggs, potatoes, and, often, 
thinly sliced onions, the tortilla is a cornerstone of the Spanish culinary tradition of tapas, where it's served 
alongside other appetizers and finger foods. Surprisingly complex in both flavor and texture for its seemingly 
simple ingredient list, a Spanish tortilla can also be surprisingly difficult to make at home, which makes the 
ease of preparing Trader Joe's Tortilla Española all the more impressive.

Made for us by a supplier in Spain who specializes in this iconic dish, our Tortilla Española only needs a few 
minutes on the stovetop (or a little longer in the microwave) to go from frozen to ready to serve. Rich, yet 
texturally light, with a well-balanced blend of savory flavors, Trader Joe's Tortilla Española is particularly 
suited for pairing with drinks when friends are over, or as an appetizer for an elegant dinner party. It's equally 
delicious when served warm, at room temperature, or even cold (as a leftover, straight out of the fridge, 
perhaps), and we find it makes an excellent quick breakfast option, too-especially if you top it with a bit of 
your favorite hot sauce.

to tell you that that's emphatically not the case. In fact, when you've got bold, flavorful, and filling options like 
Trader Joe's Spicy Peanutty Noodle Bowl with Chicken at the ready, those kinds of quick meals aren't just 
effortless, they're positively exciting!

Inspired by a savory dandan noodle dish (or dandanmien), a classic of traditional Szechuan cuisine, each 
Bowl is made with a bed of chewy wheat noodles, upon which our supplier piles tender, minced chicken and a 
medley of chopped vegetables that includes bok choy, onions, and carrots. Then, to bring everything together, 
they mix in a spicy, umami-rich peanut sauce. With every bite, you get exhilarating aromas of ginger and 
Sczechuan pepper, rich and complex flavors of tamari and peanuts, complementary textures of the noodles and 
minced chicken, and, of course, a touch of chile-powered heat. And have we mentioned that it only takes about 
five minutes in the microwave before it's ready? Now that's exciting!

"075252","Apple Tatin Tartelettes","Like so many of the world's tastiest creations, the first tarte Tatin came about quite by accident. As the story 
goes, in setting out to make a traditional apple pie, an overworked French hotelier (a one Ms. Stéphanie Tatin, 
co-owner of the Hôtel Tatin) left her apples cooking in butter and sugar for far too long. To salvage her extra-
caramelized endeavor, she placed a layer of pastry over the apples, popped the whole pan in the oven, and 
served the resulting dessert upside-down. Her guests loved this accidental apple pie-alternative so much that it 
became a fixture on the menu and, ultimately, rose to prominence all over France.

Accident or no accident, however, making a modern-day Apple Tatin from scratch is actually quite a tricky 
and time-consuming endeavor. Lucky for you, for a limited time, we're doing the work for you-and we're 
doing it well-with Trader Joe's Apple Tatin Tartelettes! They're made for us authentically in France, and 
they heat from frozen in just 15-20 minutes in the oven or 1¿-2 minutes in the microwave. They come two-

"075283","Beef Bulgogi","An eminent icon of Korean cuisine, bulgogi's origins date back over two thousand years ago to the Goguryeo 
period, where it was especially popular among the noble classes. Luckily, nowadays, you don't need a particular 
pedigree to enjoy the savory, texturally tantalizing qualities of bulgogi-in fact, all you need to do is head to 
your Trader Joe's freezer section. That's where you'll find Trader Joe's Beef Bulgogi, which our supplier makes 
with super thinly-sliced beef that's been marinated in a traditional blend of soy sauce, mirin, and sesame oil, 
along with onion, garlic, and apple, pear, and pineapple juices. 

After a matter of minutes in the microwave, or a touch longer on the stovetop, our Beef Bulgogi is aromatic 
and umami-rich, with a complex blend of sweet and savory in every tender, toothsome bite. It makes a 
remarkably easy center-of-the-plate protein option for dinner, especially when served atop a bed of fluffy 
white rice. Try it alongside a refreshing green salad, some roasted Baby Broccoli [sku 47468], or one of our

vegan breakfast proteins to our freezers, Trader Joe's Meatless Breakfast Sausage Patties are a phenomenally 
flavorful way to enjoy the eating experience of a classically herby, hearty, and savory sausage patty, while still 
maintaining a vegetarian or vegan diet. 

What's the secret? First, our supplier employs a carefully calibrated mix of textured soy protein and wheat 
gluten to impeccably emulate the toothsome texture of rich pork sausage. Second, they mix into that protein an 
aromatic blend of herbs and spices, including sage, fennel, and garlic & onion powder, so that every bite evokes 
that unmistakeable, comfort food-classic, diner-style sausage. So, how best to enjoy Trader Joe's Meatless 
Breakfast Sausage Patties? However you'd enjoy their animal-protein-based counterparts, we say! They're a

of a better bite to lift one's spirits. Get ready to cheer as we introduce you to Trader Joe's Italian Tiramisu. 

For years, we carried TJ's Tiramisu Torte [sku 53005], a cake variation that required gelatin to allow it to hold 
its shape when sliced. It sure was tasty, but we decided we could do better¿ and we certainly did! Our Italian 
Tiramisu has a base of ladyfinger biscuits that are soaked in a combination of coffee and Marsala wine, topped 
with a thick layer of sweetened mascarpone cheese, and finished with a generous dusting of cocoa powder. And 
to double the deliciousness, each package comes with two individual trays of Tiramisu. Favoloso!

To enjoy these individual servings of Tiramisu, all you have to do is thaw them. Remove one or both trays from 
the box and refrigerate for eight hours. Alternatively, to serve smaller, sharable portions, remove the Tiramisu 
from the paper tray while frozen and cut them in half before thawing on a plate in the refrigerator. You'll find 
each 13.05-ounce box of Trader Joe's Italian Tiramisu in our freezers for a limited time.

"057633","Mini Quiche Duo","There is absolutely no way to get through the holiday season without appetizers. People drop by unexpectedly 
this time of year, and oftentimes they're bearing gifts. You have to feed them. It's the civilized thing to do. 
Coming up with an entire meal on the spur of the moment? That's a tall order. But popping some appetizers 
into the oven? That makes things easy, allows enough time for some urbane conversation while they cook, 
and makes it easy to continue to socialize while you nosh. Appetizers can be your salvation.

A new entry in our selection is Trader Joe's Mini Quiche Duo. Long ago, we sold an assortment of mini 
quiche, but it's been a number of years since we've tasted any that lived up to our standards. We were looking 
for a more buttery crust and for flavorful fillings that delivered on the promises of their packaging. Trader 
Joe's Mini Quiche Duo satisfies and surpasses those standards. Each package contains six Mushroom & 
Swiss Cheese Mini Quiches and six Uncured Bacon & Sweet Onion Mini Quiches. They're eggy, buttery, 
rich, and supremely satisfying in every way. 

Their price is equally satisfying. We've seen similar, less delicious mini quiche assortments selling for $5 
and up, but we're selling each 8.9-ounce package of twelve Mini Quiches for $3.99. You'll find them in our 
freezers, for a limited time.

into a magnificently cozy dessert. This remarkably resourceful transformation is 1) nothing short of magic, and 
2) the inspiration behind Trader Joe's Pretzel Bread Pudding with Salted Caramel Sauce. 

A true celebration of sweet and salty desserts, this Pudding starts with soft, salty, Pretzel pieces, baked in a 
traditional egg custard. Before the Pudding is added to the single serving cup, our supplier heaps in a generous 
spoonful of Salted Caramel Sauce. The contents of the cup are frozen, and here's where the real culinary magic 
happens. After you heat the Pretzel Bread Pudding in either the microwave or oven, flip the cup over onto 
a plate. The Caramel bottom becomes the top and melts over the entire Pudding! Yes! Each 7.6-ounce box 
contains two individual portioned cups of Pretzel Bread Pudding. Pick up a couple boxes for your next dinner 
party, or keep one in the freezer for yourself! You'll find them in our freezers for a limited time.

"076705","Chicken Shawarma Bowl","Let's take a moment to appreciate the sublimely simple utility of the bowl, shall we? Not strictly the bowl as 
a vessel, per se (although that's certainly worthy of appreciation), but as a unit of meal. For years, we've been 
building up our selection of bowls within our frozen section (like our Mandarin Style Orange Chicken Bowl 
[sku 64527] or Green Chile Chicken Bowl [sku 75378], to name just a couple), each perfectly portioned for 
ease of preparation, variety of flavor, and convenience of transportation. We're proud to introduce yet another 
bowl option to the fold, this time drawing inspiration from the culinary tradition of doner kebab: Trader Joe's 
Chicken Shawarma Bowl!

Each Bowl is made with a bed of fluffy basmati rice, which our supplier tops with red bell pepper, spinach, 
and diced, Shawarma-style-seasoned Chicken, along with a tart, tangy, and garlicky sour cream sauce to tie 
them all together. After just a few minutes in the microwave (or a little longer in the conventional oven), this 
full-flavored Bowl is ready to enjoy as a quick and easy work lunch, an effortless weeknight dinner, or as part 
of a more involved, Mediterranean-style spread with your favorite hummus, some Dolmas [50752], and a bit of 
toasted pita or lavash bread. Savory, hearty, and consummately convenient, we recommend keeping a Chicken 
Shawarma Bowl or two in your freezer to make the most of those ""what-on-earth-am-I-gonna-eat?"" moments.

"076647","Empanadas de Ropa Vieja","Ropa vieja is a much-adored entrée, globally, with variations in a multitude of cultures across the Americas, the 
Iberian Peninsula, and the Philippines. It's particularly treasured within the culinary canon of Cuba, where it 
is celebrated as the country's national dish. So named for its resemblance to old, torn-up clothing, the Cuban 
version of ropa vieja is typically made with shredded beef stewed in a rich, tomato-based sauce, along with  
onions, bell peppers and a savory suite of satisfyingly zesty spices. That's the approach our supplier in Florida-
the capital of Cuban cuisine within the U.S., we might add-takes with Trader Joe's Empanadas de Ropa 
Vieja, which recontextualizes this classic dish into the cozy confines of a crisp, cassava-based pastry crust.

And since our supplier has done all that work for you, all you need to do to enjoy these estimable Empanadas 
is heat them, from frozen, in your oven for about 15 minutes, or your air fryer for about 10. From there, you're 
free to enjoy them as an effortless appetizer along with your favorite dipping sauce-we find that their rich,  
hearty flavor and mix of tender and crispy textures take especially well to the herby, slightly spicy notes of 
our Chimichurri Sauce [sku 73649], for instance. Or, if you're more in the mood for a full meal, enjoy them 
alongside some well-seasoned rice and Organic Black Beans [sku 50262].

"075003","Herbes de Provence Potato Wedges","Potatoes are about as classic a side dish as you'll ever find-there's a reason the phrase ""meat and potatoes"" 
is used to connote things that are simple, tried and true, and fundamentally solid. In fact, they're already so 
naturally hearty and satisfyingly starchy, that they only require a little seasoning to become something truly 
spectacular. It's a phenomenon that's evident in every bite of Trader Joe's Herbes de Provence Potato Wedges, 
a frozen side dish that makes the simple pleasures of crisp, herby potatoes and makes it even simpler: just heat, 
serve, and enjoy!

Each bag is made with a mix of two golden potato varietals, Melody and Agata, which our supplier cuts 
into bite-sized Wedges before seasoning with olive oil and a classic Herbes de Provence blend that includes 
oregano, savory, rosemary, basil and thyme. They then roast them until they're just crisp on the outside and 
creamy on the inside, then flash freeze them, allowing you to finish them at home with just a few minutes in 
the oven or air fryer. We find that they make an indispensable addition to practically any meal, especially as 
a side to your favorite full-flavored protein. And as the holidays get near, they're especially handy to keep on 
hand when entertaining friends and family.

"074741","Dutch Griddle Cakes","What's the difference between a pancake and a griddle cake? In certain parts of the world, the two are more 
or less synonymous. But when and where they do differ, it's largely a matter of height: while a typical pancake 
tends to be rather thin, griddle cakes are usually considerably thicker, with a springier, slightly chewier texture 
that's comparable to a Crumpet [sku 14622]. That certainly fits the bill for our frozen, fully-cooked, and ready-
to-heat Trader Joe's Dutch Griddle Cakes. They're made for us by a supplier in the Netherlands, who crafts 
each Cake to a luxuriously lofty stature, creating an altogether elevated breakfast option. 

The best part? These sweet, tasty Griddle Cakes take only a few minutes in the oven or toaster-or mere 
seconds in the microwave-before they're ready to be topped with a pat of butter, a swirl of Organic Maple 
Syrup [sku 89792], and a generous dollop of whipped cream. Grab a few Griddle Cakes (each package contains

us to bring Trader Joe's Chicken Breakfast Sausage Patties into our freezers. From the spirited sizzle and 
alluring aroma they give off as they cook, to the tender texture and savory flavor in each bite, everything about 
them is designed for maximum satisfaction. Perhaps most satisfying of all, however, is just how easy they are to 
prepare: since these Patties arrive fully cooked, all they take is mere minutes in the frying pan, microwave, or 
air fryer before they're ready to enjoy.

Quick, convenient, and entirely delicious, Trader Joe's Chicken Breakfast Sausage Patties are made with 
totally antibiotic-free chicken and seasoned with aromatic herbs and spices, like sage, thyme, and crushed red

"075065","Par-Baked Organic French Demi-Baguettes","It's often said that the best baguettes in the world are made in France. There are a few theories as two why: some 
argue that it's a tendency for higher gluten content, some point to a mastery of fermentation techniques, others 
tie it to various intangible qualities of local ingredients. Whatever the cause, it got us thinking: why not bring 
France to our freezers? Thus, we bring to you Trader Joe's Par-Baked Organic French Demi-Baguettes, two 
individual, half-size baguettes made especially for us by a renowned French bakery.

Our Organic French Demi-Baguettes are Par-Baked (partially baked) to about 80% doneness, then flash-
frozen for you to finish at home. Once fully cooked in your oven (simply place them directly on the center rack 
and bake at 400°F for about six minutes), the Baguettes can be enjoyed in any way you would if they came from 
a boulangerie on the banks of the Seine. Cut them into hunks and enjoy them with a bowl of soup. Tear them 
into pieces and dip them into a flavorful blend of olive oil, Balsamic vinegar, and TJ's Crunchy Chili Onion [sku

choose to enjoy these Baguettes, they're Par-Baked-n-ready to take you on a tasty little trip to France-for a

"075819","Double Chocolate Croissants","Our frozen 4 Chocolate Croissants [sku 91087] and 4 Almond Croissants [sku 98265] have been filling customers' 
kitchens (and tummies) with the alluring aroma and impressive quality of fresh-from-the-bakery pastry 
(without the bakery price tag) for years. Inspired by recent recipe research, one of our product developers 
worked with our croissant supplier to create a cocoa-infused counterpart to join the bunch, and the result is 
Trader Joe's Double Chocolate Croissants, available in our freezers just in time for baking season!

Our Double Chocolate Croissants start out with the same, yeast-leavened, laminated dough (meaning it's 
repeatedly rolled and folded with layers of butter to create a crisp, flaky Croissant) as their predecessors. Cocoa 
powder is added to this Croissant dough to give it a subtle chocolate flavor and deep brown hue. It also impacts 
the texture-giving the baked Croissant a softer interior than our non-cocoa enhanced croissants. After the 
lamination process, two sticks (yes, two!) of rich, semi-sweet Chocolate are placed in the center of the dough 
before it is rolled into the classic pain au chocolat shape. Each box comes with four Croissants, so you can 
make as few or as many as you'd like. Remove them from the package and let them proof overnight (just as a 
bakery would); in the morning you'll find the Croissants have nearly tripled in size! Bake them in the oven 
for 25 minutes (your kitchen will smell marvelous) for Croissants with delicately crisp exteriors and melted 
Chocolate within. Yummmmm.

These confections are the country's official ""national truffle."" Now, for a limited time, you can get the Trader 
Joe's version of these treats in our freezers.

Trader Joe's Brigadeiros are made for us in Portugal, where they're also a treasured confection. Our authentic 
recipe includes sweetened condensed milk, cream, cocoa, and cultured butter. This combination creates a 
rich, dense, chocolatey ball of fudge. Each soft sphere is rolled in real chocolate sprinkles, providing a pleasant 
textural contrast-not to mention more chocolate flavor. But you may ask: why the name?

Brigadeiros were first popularized during the Brazilian presidential election of 1945, when Brazilian women 
(who just recently had gained the right to vote), made mounds & mounds of these bonbons and sold them in 
support of their candidate, Brigadier Eduardo Gomes. While Gomes lost the election, one might say that the 
rest of the country still won, as the popularity of ""brigadier's candy"" proliferated. 

Pick up a box of nine Trader Joe's Brigadeiros in our freezers today, and you'll also feel like you've won-
maybe not an election, but certainly an opportunity to share in this international delight!

Cucurbitaceae-based comfort food into our stores. Made exclusively for us in Italy, it starts with a savory 
Butternut-based sauce, its velvety texture buoyed by puréed carrot and butter, and seasoned with fragrant 
rosemary, pepper, and ginger. Combined with a smoky béchamel sauce made with smoked Provola cheese 
(aka Provolone's unaged cousin) and layered between tender sheets of Italian egg pasta, the resulting Lasagna 
is crowned with even more smoked Provola cheese, breadcrumbs, pumpkin seeds, and chives. It's nutty, savory,

"075067","Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread","Maybe it's chemistry, maybe it's biology, maybe it's some grand, unfathomable cosmic connection, but there's 
just something about the combination of shrimp, garlic, and a creamy sauce that makes it seem as though 
all three were made for one another. Time and time again, in curries, pastas, and chowders, these three 
powerhouses of flavor form something even greater than the already-formidable sum of their parts. And now, 
in Trader Joe's Shrimp & Garlic Flatbread, this tremendous trio takes their talents in a crisp, cheesy, decidedly 
pizza-esque direction. 

Each Flatbread starts with a light and thin rectangular crust, to which our supplier adds a rich, garlic-butter 
béchamel sauce that's been seasoned with white pepper and curry powder, aromatic herbs like chives and 
parsley, as well as orange and lemon zest for a bit of balancing acidity. Next, they add savory and slightly 
umami-tinged grated Parmesan, and de-shelled, tail-off Shrimp to complete the picture. Once cooked in your 
home oven (18-20 minutes at 475°F, from frozen, ought to do the trick) this Flatbread makes an easy and 
delicious appetizer or entrée: we recommend pairing it with an Organic Caesar Salad [sku 61855] to make it a 
complete meal, and a glass of crisp white wine to make the most of its classic creamy garlic & shrimp combo.

"075233","Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl","Starting your morning with a bowl of fruit is a sure-fire way to make your day that much brighter (and sweeter, 
and tangier-depending on the fruit, of course). That's why we're such big fans of Trader Joe's Mango Blueberry 
Chia Bowl. Made with an ingredient deck that's exclusively fruit, fruit juice, chia seeds, and water, each bowl 
starts with a base of tangy mango purée that's been mixed with coconut cream, passion fruit juice, and black 
chia seeds. Together, the sweet and tropical notes of the mango and passionfruit play perfectly off of the plush 
silkiness of the coconut cream and satisfying chewiness of the chia seeds. And when you combine that with 
the clean and simple flavors of the included whole blueberries and diced mango, you've got one magnificent 
morning on your hands.

And since all the puréeing, chopping, and mixing has been done for you already, all you need to do to enjoy our 
frozen Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl is to let it thaw-either overnight in the fridge, for about an hour and a 
half at room temperature, or by heating in the microwave for a little more than a minute. It makes an excellent 
(not to mention effortless) weekday breakfast option, especially when topped with something crunchy, like 
chopped nuts, a full-flavored granola, or our very own Organic Unsweetened Coconut Chips [sku 57070]. Try 
bringing a Bowl to work or school, letting it thaw on your commute, and enjoying as a sweet morning treat.

"075475","Chicken Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas","As with many foods that are so deeply rooted in a culture, no one is exactly sure from whence the term 
pupusa comes. We like the story that it comes from a combination of the Mayan words pop (""sphere""), and utz 
(""good""). Aside from a visit to your local pupuseria, Trader Joe's Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas are 
a convenient and delicious way to satisfy all your ""good-sphere"" cravings!

Pupusas begin as a ball of corn-flour dough that is flattened and stuffed with meat and cheese, then rolled back 
up into a sphere before being gently flattened once again to form a sort of savory, stuffed pancake. Our Pupusas 
are filled with chicken breast & thigh meat, shredded mozzarella cheese, and roasted Hatch chiles. These simple 
flavors-tender savory chicken, smooth melty cheese, and mildly smoky chili-peppers-combine to create a 
delicious and comforting handheld snack. 

We recommend you heat Trader Joe's Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas from frozen in a skillet with a 
bit of oil, cooking for 5 or so minutes per side until golden brown and heated through. Then you can dip them 
in your favorite TJ's salsa, like our Hatch Valley Salsa [sku 53680] for added Hatch flavor, or our mild Pico de 
Gallo [sku 93920]. If you have the gumption and the time, you can combine TJ's Shredded Green Cabbage [sku

with the ease of preparation, within ten minutes of deciding to enjoy a Trader Joe's Wild Mushroom & Black 
Truffle, there can be a gorgeous, golden-colored baked flatbread sitting  on your countertop, ready to slice and 
serve. Whatever your intentions, it makes a wonderful appetizer for a group get together or served alongside a 
salad and split down the middle for a romantic night in.

"073567","Portuguese Bacalhau Tartlettes","If you are one of the many customers who love our sweet Trader Joe's Portuguese Custard Tarts [sku 69352]-
and there are many-then you're also going to love the fish version! Before you start second-guessing our 
judgment, hear us out...

Trader Joe's Bacalhau Tartelettes (Bacalhau means ""cod"" in Portuguese), are made by the same supplier who 
makes our pasteles de nata. These pasteles de bacalhau have an all-butter laminated crust that holds a creamy 
filling made with bechamel, egg yolks, diced potato, and salted cod. These flavors are enhanced by onion and 
garlic, with additional hints of nutmeg and piri piri chilis.

Our Bacalhau Tartelettes may not be what you'd choose at breakfast with your coffee, but they certainly fit in 
quite well as a handy, bite-sized appetizer. Give them a squeeze of fresh lemon, then pair them with other TJ's 
app-favorites-plus some chilled, Portuguese wine, such as Espiral Rosé [sku 97395], or Espiral Vinho Verde 
[sku 47536].

"010142","Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche","Quiche tends to have a reputation for being a highfalutin, complicated piece of haute cuisine among the general 
public, but its formulation is actually quite simple: a rich, buttery crust filled with fluffy eggs, and other tasty 
fillings. We've always thought that this simple, savory-pie construction is one of its greatest strengths. Trader 
Joe's Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche definitely plays to this strength-but don't think for a minute that 
""simple construction"" means anything less than delicious!

This one begins with a flaky, wheat-flour crust, shaped like a fluted pie shell. Inside that shell is a fluffy mixture 
of eggs, with both mild & sharp Cheddar cheeses, plus pieces of Broccoli. Savory (and simple) seasonings 
support these flavors, including onions, garlic, salt & black pepper.

Keeping with the theme, it couldn't be much simpler to prepare this Broccoli & Cheddar Cheese Quiche. 
Cook it from frozen for 3 minutes in your microwave, or 20-25 minutes in your 400°F conventional oven. Let it 
rest for 1-2 minutes, and your Quiche is hot (and haute!) and ready to enjoy. It's the ideal size for an individual 
breakfast. Or slice it in half and pair with Trader Joe's Fully Cooked Uncured Bacon [sku 86483], and A Fruitful 
Medley [sku 54991] for a fast and delicious brunch for two!

"075760","Fudgy Cookie Dough Ice Cream","Made for us by the same supplier as some of our other (widely celebrated, if we do say so ourselves) seasonal 
pints, Trader Joe's Fudgy Cookie Dough Ice Cream is a fun, fudge-filled take on an ice-cold classic. Our 
supplier starts with a base of rich vanilla ice cream, then mixes in toothsome pieces of chocolate chip Cookie 
Dough and some additional chocolatey chips. Finally, for an applause-worthy finishing touch, they imbue the 
Ice Cream with a Fudgy, sea-salted swirl. Can you say swoon? Well, we just did. And you will, too.

Although our Fudgy Cookie Dough Ice Cream makes an excellent anytime treat, we find that it's best enjoyed 
as a sweet reward at the end of a hot summer's day. Want to bump up the fudge factor even further? Try topping 
it with a drizzle of TJ's Organic Midnight Moo Chocolate Syrup [sku 76710]. You might also consider adding a 
spoonful of TJ's Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce [sku 95214] to spotlight the sea-saltiness of this ever-evolving ice

"076023","Kimbap","Known in Korea as gimbap, from gim for ""seaweed"" and bap for ""cooked rice,"" kimbap is similar to-but 
decidedly distinct from-a mega-sized maki sushi roll. Whereas maki is typically made with vinegar-seasoned 
rice and focuses on one filling (like a single variety of vegetable or fish), kimbap is made with sesame oil-seasoned 
rice, and can contain all kinds of combinations of savory fillings. Trader Joe's Kimbap, for example, takes a 
veggie-forward approach. Our supplier, a kimbap expert in the Republic of Korea, arranges an assortment of 
sauteed greens, crunchy root vegetables, and crisp pickles around a base of braised tofu, wraps it all in a layer 
of rice and seaweed, then slices it into two-or-three-bite-sized rounds.

When viewed in cross section, our conveniently quick-cooking Kimbap resembles a marvelous, multi-flavored 
mosaic. After cooking from frozen for a mere two minutes in the microwave, it can be enjoyed hot or chilled, 
served as an entrée, side, or snack. While it's flavorful enough to hold its own as a dish, it also accessorizes well 
with a bit of Sriracha [sku 50828], Gochujang Sauce [sku 74565], or Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce [sku 26426]. For 
an even more satisfying textural dimension, we recommend giving each piece a quick pan-fry: two minutes in 
hot oil per side ought to do the trick.

"073030","Chicken Karaage","For many Americans, the mention of fried chicken conjures up large, bone-in, skin-on, chicken breasts that 
have been soaked in buttermilk, dredged in flour, and deep fried in oil until the exterior is crisp, and the meat 
is succulent. This kind of chicken is a delicious indulgence, whether from grandma's kitchen, or delivered in a 
bucket. However, if you are a fan of Japanese food, ""fried chicken"" may mean something different-and that 
(equally delicious) difference can now be experienced in Trader Joe's Chicken Karaage.

Our Chicken Karaage [ka-RAH-geh] is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, made with a Japanese-
inspired recipe. It begins with bite-sized pieces of boneless, skinless, leg meat that have been tenderized and 
flavor-infused after marinating in rice wine (mirin), soy sauce, and white wine vinegar-along with garlic 
& ginger powders. Karaage is typically served with lemon wedges, so we intentionally added vinegar to this 
recipe to mimic that lovely, lemon-like tang you experience when you order the dish in a Japanese restaurant. 

The chicken is then dredged in a mixture of wheat flour, cornmeal, and starches, and cooked in soybean oil 
until crisp. The finished Karaage is frozen and packaged, ready to be reheated and eaten by you! (Use an air 
fryer if you have one, otherwise a conventional oven will do just fine.) Stack the Chicken pieces on a plate with 
a garnish of lemon wedges (if you have them), next to a side of the creamy, sweet & savory dipping sauce.

you can still enjoy super tasty frozen desserts, like Trader Joe's Hold the Dairy Non-Dairy Salted Caramel

Dairy treat is smooth and delicious (we'd say ""creamy"" but there's absolutely no cream in the recipe). Salted 
Caramel Flavor (i.e., caramelized sugar, salt, etc.) sweetens the deal even more. Then, this dreamy Frozen

finally finished with some chocolatey chunks on top!

Celebration Cake Gelato arrives in our freezers on the heels of our Chromatic Celebration Cake Mix, a limited-
edition baking mix that wowed customers earlier this year. If you're a fan of the classic cake-and-ice-cream 
combo, this Gelato will be your jam. Cake-batter-flavored gelato sets the stage, while pieces of cake (yes, actual

were the rule.  You can be sure to count us in for any situation in which rules call for ice cream floats. Make 
it a root beer float, with a scoop of rich vanilla ice cream, and we've potentially found paradise in a mug. For 
those moments where a mug is unavailable, and the draw of a root beer float remains strong, we're delighted to 
introduce Trader Joe's Root Beer Float Inspired Bars.

Akin to the classic orange-and-cream bars of childhood memories (there we go with the nostalgia again!), 
these frozen dessert Bars feature an icy, root beer-flavored outside, and a creamy, vanilla ice cream center. The 
stick-based delivery system allows you to ditch the glassware and enjoy a root beer float on the go. By the pool, 
at a picnic, after a post-dinner game of freeze tag with the neighbors... whenever a craving for a root beer float 
strikes, simply reach into your freezer (or an ice-packed cooler) and grab a Root Beer Float Inspired Bar. Or 
get meta with it and blend it up with... you guessed it, root beer, for a frothy, creamy, icy treat you can drink 
with a straw.

We're offering these kosher (dairy) certified Bars in a 15-fluid ounce box of six, for a limited time. You'll find 
them in our freezer case, for as long as we can keep them in stock.

The sweet, cocoa-y taste of the melty chocolate? The light, pillowy texture of the toasted marshmallows? After 
some contemplation (and much sampling), we've determined that it must be the combination of all three that 
makes everyone say, ""S'more, please."" 

Trader Joe's S'mores Bars contain all the components of this campfire classic, in a format similar to our lemon 
bars. The bottom layer of each Bar is a graham-cracker-crumb crust, the middle is a rich, fudgy brownie, and 
the top is a gooey layer of toasted marshmallow. And there's no campfire required to enjoy these S'mores Bars; 
it's as simple as removing them from the freezer and letting them thaw at room temperature for about two 
hours. But if you do miss the warmth of traditional s'mores, they heat up within minutes in an oven or air fryer.

We're selling each 7.5-ounce box of six Trader Joe's S'mores Bars for $4.99. Pick one up, then pick up s'more...

nice piece of grilled chicken. The only trouble, of course, is that when you're in that something-scrumptious-

offer our frozen Trader Joe's Grilled Chicken Strips. Each bag contains a pound of fully-cooked white chicken 
meat that's been seasoned with just a touch of savory spices, then cut into highly servable strips. And since they 
only take a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop to go from frozen to steamy, juicy, and ready-to-
eat, it's never been easier to put protein on your plate.

If you regularly prep school or work lunches, you'll especially appreciate how quick, convenient, and tasty these  
tender, flavorful, Grilled Chicken Strips are. They pair well with all kinds of veggies and starches, and take 
particularly well to customizing with your favorite sauces and seasonings-we're partial to tossing them with 
a bit of Korean Gochujang Sauce [sku 74565], ourselves. They're a great topper for salads, pastas, and pizzas,

white cabbage, carrot, chive, white radish, onion - plus a dash of ginger, garlic and soy sauce. Already fully 
cooked, our Thai Vegetable Gyoza easily fulfill your preparation preference - steam, pan fry,  microwave, or 
add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom 
side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to 
brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the  pan (take care to 
not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone). Serve hot with our Gyoza Dipping Sauce [sku

Mini Cheeseburgers can be enjoyed one by one, as an individual, anytime snack, split amongst friends as 
an appetizer or hors d'oeuvre, or eaten all together with a side salad as a fun, flavorful entrée. Each Mini

"075851","Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato","In Italian, ""gelato"" is the word for ""ice cream"" in general. Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain 
style-so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice 
cream. An ice cream that's intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that's wondrously light, 
yet velvety and dense. An ice cream like Trader Joe's Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato. 

Like our seasonal Strawberries & Cream Gelato [sku 75375], TJ's Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato 
is made for us by an Italian supplier using more milk than cream, yielding a lower butterfat content than 
you'd find in American-style ice cream. This gives the Gelato  a light, refreshing quality while still remaining 
delectably smooth and creamy, and allows its Chocolate and Vanilla Bean flavors (courtesy of cocoa, semisweet 
chocolate, and actual vanilla bean specks) and its sweet, chocolate-sauce Swirl to really shine.

Instead of a traditional pint, we've very intentionally packed our Chocolate & Vanilla Bean Swirl Gelato  
in a 1.8-pint (850mL) tub. Peel off the lid, and the Gelato's dazzling peaks and swirls will conjure up all the 
beautifully decorated, sumptuous ripples you'd find in an authentic, Italian gelateria! It's such a pretty sight that 
you'll want to serve it at all your summer soirées, out in the open for all to admire.

Unlike some stores' fruity, frozen treats, Trader Joe's Strawberry Lemonade Ice Bars get their sweet and 
slightly sour Strawberry Lemonade flavor from strawberry purée, lemon juice concentrate, and other natural 
flavors - no artificial flavors here, folks. On top of being tasty, the Bars are also quite beautiful, calling to mind 
a summer sunset with a palette of pink, white, and strawberry-red, all derived from fruit and veggie juices. 
Stash a few boxes in your freezer so you can serve them to guests whenever refreshment is on the agenda!

"075602","S'Mores Ice Cream","Made for us by the same supplier as some of our other (widely celebrated, if we do say so ourselves) seasonal 
pints, Trader Joe's S'Mores Ice Cream expertly evokes the taste of the classic, campfire confection from which 
it takes its name. It's a strikingly simple concept, really-just like the genuine article. We start with a base of 
rich, graham cracker-flavored ice cream, imbue it with marshmallow & chocolatey swirls, add a pinch of sea 
salt, sound the bugle, and call it a day!  
 
Although our S'Mores Ice Cream makes an excellent anytime treat, we find that it's best enjoyed as a satisfyingly 
sweet reward at the end of a hot summer's day. And if you really want to earn your dessert-making merit 
badge, you can top it with crushed Graham Cracker Squares [sku 71089], a few Marshmallows [sku 56661], 
and a drizzle of Organic Midnight Moo [76710] for a scrumptious s'mores sundae. Remember, though, just like 
summer camp, the season for S'Mores Ice Cream will eventually come to a close, so if this stuff makes you 
want to sing along, hurry to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and grab s'more before it's gone!

"075558","Whole Grain Waffles","For something so seemingly simple, waffles have a whole lot of history behind them. A culinary and etymological 
descendant of the wafer, the treat that would eventually become the waffle showed up in Northern Europe in 
the 12th century as a kind of sweeter, more secular version of communion wafers used in Catholic mass. By 
the 15th century, dedicated waffle irons became commonplace across the continent (especially in Belgium, 
perhaps unsurprisingly), and waffles began to take on their recognizable, checkerboard-esque appearance. 
And now, we're delighted to keep the nearly millenium-long history of waffles going by welcoming Trader Joe's 
Whole Grain Waffles to our frozen waffle offerings.

Made for us in Belgium, with hearty whole wheat flour, and containing an impressive 30g of whole grains in 
every serving, Trader Joe's Whole Grain Waffles take only a few minutes in the toaster or conventional oven 
before they're captivatingly crisp on the outside, and delightfully warm and chewy on the inside. We find that 
with their savory flavor profile and expertly tuned texture, there's really no wrong way to go when choosing 
toppings. Try them with your favorite syrup, a pat of Organic Salted Butter [sku 39302], fresh cut fruit, and/or 
whipped cream. If you're truly going big on breakfast, you might even try a scoop of Speculoos Cookie Butter 
Ice Cream [sku 55340].

"073707","Shrimp Boom Bah","Every now and then, we introduce something so exciting, so enchanting , so ebulliently electrifying, that we can't 
help but become its biggest cheerleader. That's certainly the case for Trader Joe's Shrimp Boom Bah, a sweet, 
spicy, and satisfyingly crispy dish that's just as fun to eat as it is to say. (Go ahead, give it a try!) Each package 
contains a collection of shelled, tail-off shrimp that's been coated in a savory-seasoned batter. Once cooked (either 
in your oven, air fryer, or deep fryer) and combined with the included sweet and spicy sauce, every bite bursts 
with a complementary combo of flavors and textures thrilling enough to make you shout, ""Rah! Rah! Rah!""

With its fun, flashy flavors and remarkable ease of preparation (the Shrimp only take about twelve minutes to 
cook in the oven or air fryer), Trader Joe's Shrimp Boom Bah is a total game-changer. Equally delicious as an 
appetizer as it is an entrée, it can be enjoyed totally on its own, either tossed in the sauce or served alongside 
it for dipping, as the protein in a quick rice bowl, or as the filling for super delicious lettuce wraps. And if all 
that weren't enough, it's a tremendous value, too. Because if there's one thing that will really make us cheer, it's 
getting more Boom for your buck.

ter [sku 97846], Speculoos Cookie and Cocoa Swirl [sku 51129]) are irresistible and easy to spread on waffles, 
pancakes, toast, apples, and even other cookies. But butter isn't so easily ""spread"" on ice cream. (Actually, in a 
recent feature on our Dig In blog, we imagined and constructed 16 different sundaes using our products, one 
of which included a sauce of heated Cookie Butter¿ tasty, but not the most effortless medium for drizzling!)

If you've been dreaming, like us, of that no-brainer combination of ice cream and Speculoos Cookie But-
ter, you can wake up now¿ it's here! This food-fantasy-come-true is churned exclusively for us in Cleveland, 
Ohio using only the freshest Midwest cream. It's flavored with the finest vanilla extract from Madagascar, and 
speckled with actual pieces of Speculoos-the original Belgian cookie that started it all. Of course, our famous 
Cookie Butter, itself, is swirled throughout.

How to serve it? Easy. Get a spoon and a bowl. Or, fill your favorite cone. Top a fresh made brownie, or toasted 
waffle. Put a scoop next to your birthday cake. We've yet to create a Speculoos Pie, but you can make your own 
by softening two quarts of Cookie Butter Ice Cream in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, and spoon the 
softened ice cream into a graham cracker or chocolate cookie crust. Smooth it out with a knife or spatula and 
decorate the top with shaved chocolate. Yum!

The one-quart (32-ounce) carton is $4.49. You'll find it in our freezer case¿ that is, assuming we can keep it 
stocked!

"075557","Breaded Cheddar Cheese Curds","When in Wisconsin, one eats as the Wisconsites do. And often, that means taking a soft, chewy, and surprisingly 
squeaky bite of a cheese curd. A natural product of the cheese-making process, cheese curds are typically made 
from bits of extremely unaged Cheddar, and can be found fresh, fried, and served over salads on bar menus and 
at ball parks across the Badger State. Squarely fitting in the ""fried"" variation of this regional fave, Trader Joe's 
Breaded Cheddar Cheese Curds are proudly made with Wisconsin Cheddar, coated with a savory-seasoned 
batter, and fried to tasty, textural perfection.

As any cheese-appreciating Wisconsite will tell you, a proper cheese curd should make a squeaking sensation 
between your teeth as you bite into it-a feeling not dissimilar from the texture of fried halloumi or bread 
cheese. We're happy to report that our Cheese Curds most certainly have that squeak, plus the captivating 
crunch of their crispy, Breaded exterior. Easily prepared in the oven or air fryer, they can be enjoyed on their 
own as a quick snack, with your favorite dipping sauce as an appetizer, or paired with a pint of your favorite 
lager or ale. You'll find Trader Joe's Breaded Cheddar Cheese Curds chilling in our freezers.

Plant-Based Fish Fillets have come ashore! Made with an ingenious mix of king oyster mushrooms and 
jackfruit, and coated in a light, crunchy, gluten-free batter, these totally vegan, gluten free Fillets capture all the 
same flavors and textures you'd expect from a boardwalk basket of fried fish, all while containing no animal-
derived ingredients. With their satisfyingly crisp exterior and phenomenally flaky interior, they're a great 
entrée, appetizer, or center-of-the-plate-protein option for vegans, omnivores, pescetarians with plant-based 
proclivities, or any fan of seafood, regardless of dietary preference. 

In less than half an hour in the oven (or half that in an air fryer), these Fillets cook to a warm, golden brown, 
and can be used in all kinds of dishes. We're particularly partial to featuring them in a vegetarian version of 
fish and chips, roughly chopping them for plant-based fish tacos, or stacking them into a sandwich with Vegan 
Mayo [sku 71042], pickles, lettuce, and a dash of hot sauce. Feeling a little fancy? Try serving a Fillet or two

"074252","Sfogliatella Pastry","Do you remember our finger-friendly, fall-season appetizer called Eggplant Parmigiana Sfogliatelle [sku 74634]? 
We created those savory morsels in the image of a sweet pastry called Sfogliatella [sfoh-lee-ah-TELL-a], which 
has roots in Napoli, Italy. Our Eggplant Sfogliatelle were such a success (and they're coming back next holiday 
season!), it only made sense to introduce our customers to the unique treat upon which they were based. Say 
hello to Trader Joe's Naples Style Sfogliatella Pastry!

In Italian, Sfogliatella means ""small, thin leaf or layer,"" which speaks to the incredibly fine, crisp layers that 
make up the exterior of this pastry. The laborious lamination technique used to create our Sfogliatella is done 
almost entirely by hand, by artisans skilled in the Sfogliatella craft. It involves making what amounts to pasta 
dough, which is rolled into long, super-thin sheets, and topped with vegetable-oil. The sheets are then rolled 
into a long cylinder, creating dozens of thin layers. Finally, the cylinder is cut into discs that are each gently 
hand-pressed into a wide, conical shape. After being loaded with a delicious filling that includes ricotta cheese 
and candied orange peel, the Pastries are partially closed, somewhat resembling a clam shell.

In addition to their authentic construction and amazing taste, what really makes Trader Joe's Classic Naples 
Style Sfogliatella Pastry stand out from other versions is their ease of preparation. They're ready to bake from 
frozen (no proofing), and can be enjoyed after just 35-40 minutes in your 350°F conventional oven!

"099142","Chicken Tikka Masala","First introduced to our freezers in 2009, Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala quickly became a favorite among 
Customers and Crew alike. What's that? You haven't tried it yet? Oh, boy. It's time. This classic, Indian(ish) dish 
features chunks of chicken that have been roasted in an oven, or tandoor, and served in a creamy, mildly spicy, 
tomato-based, curry flavored sauce. A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic 
dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. 
This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that 
this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain.  We don't have proof, but the sources seem pretty 
reliable. (This explains our ""ish"" after ""Indian."")

Regardless of its origins, we can tell you that Trader Joe's Chicken Tikka Masala with cumin-flavored basmati 
Rice is made just for us by a small, U.S.-based company that specializes in Indian-inspired foods. Rich and 
creamy sauce, tender chunks of white meat chicken, and nicely-flavored, cumin-infused basmati rice on the 
side, this frozen entrée makes a terrific lunch or dinner for one in less than five minutes in the microwave.

"075295","Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings","Since their invention nearly sixty years ago, Buffalo wings have soared to auspicious heights within the world 
of appetizers-it's difficult to imagine what modern American bar food would look like without them. In fact, 
they're so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken-
based counterparts. And while we've enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they've always felt 
different than a traditional Buffalo wing-delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category. With this 
in mind, we recently reached out to one of our suppliers, an expert in plant-based proteins, and gave them this 
challenge: a vegan, Buffalo-style appetizer that truly captures the feeling of a crisp, fresh-from-the-fryer Buffalo 
wing. They proudly came back with Trader Joe's Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.

Made with a mix of soy and pea protein, these vegan Wings have a remarkably meaty texture that's crisp on 
the outside and satisfying juicy on the inside. They only take a few minutes to prep in the air fryer (or a little 
bit longer in the oven), and each bag comes with a packet of also-vegan, Buffalo-Style hot sauce to give each 
Wing that classic, cayenne kick to every bite. We recommend them as an appetizer or snack when you've got 
folks over to watch a game or movie, as a companion to our Vegan Meatless Meat Eater's Pizza [sku 70303], or 
as the center of a spicy, Chickenless sandwich layered with shredded lettuce and pickles.

"073996","Perfectly Pickled Pups","We're becoming prolific pickle-ifiers, having already pickled popcorn, chips, hummus, mustard, jalapeños-
and of course, cucumbers, in a variety of shapes and brines. What's left to pickle? Always loving alliteration, we 
poked around, contem-plating pickled peaches, peas, potatoes, pistachios, prunes, pollock, Pad Thai, pretzels, 
peppermints, and pudding... None proved praiseworthy. (Luckily, these were just postulations and ponderings.) 
Finally, we considered pups. With persnickety pleasure, we put pups through their paces. Not only did they 
pass our production probes, but they also passed our panel! If it's not already obvious, we're proud to present 
Trader Joe's Perfectly Pickled Pups.

But pickled hot dogs, you say? Our Perfectly Pickled Pups are so much more. Parroting the format of our 
successful Parmesan Pastry Pups [sku 99272], we begin with Mini Uncured Beef Franks. These teeny wieners 
are infused with dill-pickle flavor, by way of popular brining ingredients such as sea salt, sugar, onion, garlic, 
vinegar, and dill weed. The pickle-flavored Pups are then coated in a mixure of batter and breadcrumbs that's 
seasoned with even more particularly pickley ingredients.

The results (once you procure them from the store and prepare them in your air fryer or conventional oven) 
are these savory, couple-bite-sized treats that are crispy on the outside, tender and beefy on the inside, and 
perspicuously pickle-flavored. The only pending postulation is: what will Trader Joe's pickle next?!

"056006","Vegetable Spring Rolls","Spring. A versatile word with many meanings. It can refer to a place where water emerges from an underground 
source, or a coil in a mattress. You can walk with a spring in your step or enjoy springtime weather. Or, a brilliant 
idea can spring from your mind. For us, this brilliant idea that sprung forth resulted in Trader Joe's Vegetable 
Spring Rolls.

Named after the Spring Festival in China, where spring rolls are served, these are no ordinary Spring Rolls. 
While we've kept many of the elements found in traditional spring rolls, like cabbage, onion, and carrots, we've 
also cooked up some delightful updates. Kale, shredded tofu, and edamame add fresh and vibrant flavors to our 
rolls. All of these ingredients, along with mushrooms, ginger, and garlic, are put through a centrifuge to remove 
excess moisture and provide a crispier final product. Then this filling is rolled into a thin pastry wrapper and 
fried before frozen. Prepare according to the package directions and you'll have perfectly crispy, tasty Spring 
Rolls-as if they were never frozen!  

The best part about our Vegetable Spring Rolls (besides their tastiness, of course)¿? You can eat them year 
round! Cut rolls in half and serve at a cocktail party with Sweet Chili Sauce [sku 91113]. Or, include alongside 
Mandarin Orange Chicken [sku 66563] and Organic Jasmine Rice [sku 63573] for a quick and tasty meal.

"055571","Chicken Spring Rolls","When your fingers first pinch the outside wrapper of a spring roll, the texture is the tell. Soggy sides 
foreshadow watered-down filling. Crisp sides-that crackle with your touch-hold the promise of a big, 
balanced, boastful bite. 

Chasing down this crispy-fried-roll dim sum ideal, we partnered with Asian cuisine experts (who immigrated 
to New York from Taiwan to pursue their passion for food) to create Trader Joe's Chicken Spring Rolls. 
Having  perfected the technique of eliminating excess water in their fillings, the wrappers on their rolls (now 
ours) stay exceptionally crisp. Lest you think we exaggerate, they've quantified the amount of moisture-
between 35% to 40%-that they manage to extract from the vegetables.

Even more important than the well-managed moisture are the vibrant flavors expressed in the hearty filling. 
Based on the popular Taiwanese ""3 Cup Chicken"" dish, our Chicken Spring Rolls feature chunks of white 
meat chicken, cabbage, carrots, and green onion that are cooked in hot woks with plentiful basil, garlic, and 
ginger. Simmered with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine, and chili paste, the flavor only intensifies. The finished 
filling is carefully tucked into a wheat flour wrapper and deep-fried to make a thin, light, crisp shell.

Bake in the oven (20-25 minutes), or fry on the stove top (5-10 minutes) until the outside wrapper is golden 
and tellingly crispy. Serve with our Sweet Chili Sauce [sku 91113] or Satay Peanut Sauce [sku 91369] for 
dipping. We're selling each nine ounce package of five Chicken Spring Rolls for $3.99.

"075375","Strawberries & Cream Gelato","In Italian, ""gelato"" is the word for ""ice cream"" in general. Most Italian ice cream, however, is made in a certain 
style-so when stateside treat-seekers are referring to gelato, they are typically talking about an Italian-style ice 
cream. An ice cream that's intensely creamy, yet surprisingly refreshing. An ice cream that's wondrously light, 
yet velvety and dense. An ice cream like Trader Joe's Strawberries & Cream Gelato.

Like all the greatest gelato, TJ's Strawberries & Cream Gelato is made (in Italy!) with more milk than cream, 
whereas American-style ice cream is typically made with more cream than milk. This lower butterfat content 
gives the Gelato a light, refreshing quality and allows its bright Strawberries & Cream flavor - courtesy of 
strawberry purée, candied strawberry pieces, and actual vanilla bean specks - to really shine through. And 
while you might assume that less butterfat would yield a less creamy result¿ you'd be wrong if you did. Per 
the Italian tradition (did we mention it's made in Italy?), this Gelato also holds less air than American-style 
ice cream, so it still offers that smooth, creamy mouthfeel you crave. Pick up a pint today, while supplies last.

"068834","Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried Crust","In Naples, Italy, pizza fritta is an ubiquitous street food. Pizza fritta translates directly to ""fried pizza,"" so its popularity 
isn't hard to understand. Pizza = delicious. Fried food = delicious. Fried pizza? Doubly delicious! It comes in many 
forms in the streets of Naples, and, now, in the frozen aisles of your local Trader Joe's, it comes in the form of Trader 
Joe's Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza with Deep Fried Crust.

Our Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza is made for us authentically in Naples, where our supplier takes great care in 
replicating the lengthy, artisanal process of this particular pizza-making method. The dough is matured for 90 hours, 
then fermented for 6 additional hours, and while its fermenting, they manually fold the dough three times a day. 
Once the dough reaches peak readiness, our supplier shapes it by hand and deep fries it in sunflower seed oil for 
a quick three minutes. The result is a crust that is at once perfectly crunchy and dreamily airy, chewy, and pillowy.

The toppings are just as key as the crust, and we didn't skimp there, either-our Product Developer based the recipe 
on one of the best pizzas she's ever had, which came from a teeny-tiny little pizzeria in Bari, Italy. Accordingly, we 
top each Deep Fried Crust with mozzarella, provolone, Parmigiano Reggiano, and-most importantly-dollops of 
burrata and fresh pesto with roasted garlic. It sounds fancy, but fortunately, this little slice of Italy won't cost you an 
expensive plane ticket; thanks to each 14.1 oz. TJ's Roasted Garlic & Pesto Pizza, you can experience Naples for just 
$5.99*. Find it in our freezers, then take it from oven-to-table in 15 minutes or less!

"075648","Chocolate Raspberry Swirl","Love is about compromise, give and take, and putting the needs of others before your own-but what about 
when it comes to dessert? What if you want ice cream and your partner is craving sorbet? Ice cream is rich 
and creamy, while sorbet is refreshing and light. On their own, each makes for an exceptionally satiating 
dessert, but how are you to reach an amicable decision? A dessert dyad in the form of Trader Joe's Chocolate 
Raspberry Swirl is the answer.

Decadent, luxurious Chocolate ice cream is swirled with juicy, tart Raspberry sorbet for a dynamic eating 
experience that combines the best of both worlds. The complementary nature of Chocolate and Raspberry is 
a classic pairing; each spoonful is both tart and rich, indulgent yet light, one flavor never overshadowing the 
other. 

Serve a scoop (or two) topped with a Belgian Butter Waffle Cookie [sku 67004] as an elegant end to a romantic 
meal-we'll leave the dinner menu up to you. But hurry-this sensational Swirl is only available in the freezers 
at your neighborhood Trader Joe's for a limited time.

"097706","Kung Pao Chicken","Made just for us by a supplier whose cultural and culinary roots are steeped in Chinese tradition, Trader 
Joe's Kung Pao Chicken combines dark meat chicken with crunchy green & red bell peppers, onions, dried 
chili powder, water chestnuts and peanuts. What makes this Kung Pao so distinctive, though, is the sauce. 
Traditionally, sauces for this dish are rich and savory and can range from mildly spicy to sound-the-alarm-and-
grab-a-hose hot. Ours falls in the medium-spicy range-the dish will taste substantially hotter if you actually 
eat the chili pieces, and a little less hot if you push the chilies to the side of the plate and treat them as a garnish. 
We think the heat level in our sauce makes it easy to share among friends who fall on opposite sides of the spicy 
foods debate. If really spicy is your thing, though, you can always add your favorite spicy condiment and even 
more chili peppers to the finished dish.

We recommend preparing our Kung Pao Chicken on the stovetop, in a really hot wok or skillet, but it can also 
be prepared in the microwave.  Serve it with one of our frozen, ready-in-three-minutes rice options, and you'll 
have a complete meal that evokes the best traditions of Chinese cuisine, in your kitchen, in ten minutes or less. 
We're selling each 23-ounce bag of Kung Pao Chicken for the terrific value price of $4.99, every day. You'll find 
it in our freezers.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20602/97706.png","5.99","[""Dinner Hack"",""In Lieu of Pizza""]",,"[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1 cup (150g - 115g entree with 35g/2 Tbs sauce)"",""calories_per_serving"":""240""}]"
"054241","Organic Riced Cauliflower","The Italian supplier who makes our Grilled Cauliflower [sku 54482] (non-organic) also makes a number of 
organic cauliflower products. In the process, they end up with lots of left over florets and trim. Rather than waste 
these perfectly good organic vegetables, we put our heads together and came up with a new product made from 
this extra cauliflower... but we wouldn't describe our new Organic Riced Cauliflower as ""leftovers.""

With some restaurants now serving what they're calling ""cauliflower couscous,"" many people have been 
attempting to make their own version at home. This is certainly doable, but it's difficult if you only have a cheese-
grater. And even with a food processor on hand, it can be time consuming. Thankfully, we've done the work for 
you, grating this 100% Organic Cauliflower to a couscous-like consistency, so you can focus your brainpower 
on what to serve with it!

Pour some frozen Organic Riced Cauliflower into a non-stick pan and heat it over medium heat, just until any 
residual water has cooked off. After that, the sky's the limit¿ Mix it with fresh-chopped cilantro and a squeeze 
of lime for Baja-style ""rice."" Top it with spicy curry or beef bourguignon. Serve it with Kung Pao Chicken or in 
a burrito with black beans and cheddar cheese. Make a low-carbs ""risotto"" by sautéing onions in olive oil and 
white wine, and then reducing the mixture before adding in your Riced Cauliflower. Heat until it reaches the 
desired consistency and finish with grated parmesan cheese and butter.

The only thing ""leftover"" about Trader Giotto's Organic Riced Cauliflower will be the wad of change you hold 
in your hand after only paying $1.99 for the twelve-ounce bag.

"056417","Unsweetened Organic Açaí  Puree Packets","The Açaí trend shows no signs of slowing down - and why should it? Its complex, rich-tart berry flavor, with 
subtle hints of cacao, is refreshingly irresistible. As people look to eat healthier on the go, cafes and juiceries 
have devoted entire sections of their menus to energizing smoothies and filling breakfast bowls made with 
this brilliant berry of the Amazon. These menu offerings, however, are often packed with sugar, and always 
expensive. So we set out to find an appetizing yet affordable option for açaí, and came up with our Unsweetened 
Organic Açaí Purée Packets.

Each package contains four convenient, single-serve packets of Unsweetened Organic Açaí Purée. You can 
add one to a smoothie or blend with Greek yogurt. Boost your post-workout hydration and mix a packet with 
coconut water. Blend a packet with banana and coconut milk to create a creamy base for an açaí bowl and 
add whatever toppings your heart desires - berries and granola, peaches and toasted flax, pumpkin seeds and 
coconut chips - you're only limited by your imagination (and seasonal topping availability, of course).

Other açaí purée packets out in the market (some of which are sweetened!) sell for a whopping $5.99 and up. 
We're selling four-3.52 oz. packets of Unsweetened Organic Açaí  Purée for $4.49, everyday.

For a hearty açaí bowl: Run one frozen açaí packet under running water for five seconds to thaw and break into pieces. Tear 
the corner of the packet and squeeze contents into blender, along with sliced banana and coconut milk. Blend until desired 
consistency is reached (you want the mixture thick enough to be scoopable, but not so thick that it gets stuck in your blender).  
Pour mixture into a bowl and top with sliced berries and coconut cranberry granola. Add a drizzle of honey and almond butter 
for nutty sweetness, if desired.

"099032","Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice","#Cookinghacks - that's how the original recipe for butter chicken is said to have been created.  Chef Kundan 
Lal Gujral was basically playing with a tandoor, a clay oven that conducts super high heat. Primarily used for 
baking bread, he was testing out how it might treat chicken. So, he would coat chicken pieces with yogurt, 
skewer them and place them in the tandoor...Tandoori Chicken came to be. Butter, here is where it gets better.   
To avoid letting leftover tandoori chicken get dry, he crafted a rich, silky (thank  you, butter) tomato- and 
onion-based sauce with which he could enliven the meat, and thus was born the beloved Butter Chicken. 

Trader Joe's Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice is the ultimate #Cookinghacks for this dish. Our Butter 
Chicken showcases chunks of chicken enrobed in a mild, mouth-watering curry crafted of crushed tomatoes, 
cream, onions, garlic, ginger, butter...Spiced just so, and partnered with delicate, fragrant grains of Basmati 
rice, it's ready to heat and enjoy.  Serve it with our other frozen Indian fare - TJ's Palak Paneer [sku 95812], TJ's 
Channa Masala [sku 99144],  TJ's Tandoori Naan [sku 77677] - for a feast. Don't forget the TJ's Mango Ginger

"074892","Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage","Are you in a perpetual state of trying to figure out what's for dinner? Us, too. Our latest frozen fare is a simple, 
ultra-versatile, heat-and-eat side that packs a big punch of flavor, making it our new go-to building block for 
weekday meals. Introducing, Trader Joe's Stir Fried Garlicky Cabbage.

Inspired by the Thai dish, Galam Plee Pad Nam Pla-a simple stir-fry of cabbage, a whole lot of garlic, and fish 
sauce-our version is deliciously similar, but instead of fish sauce, we season the cabbage with a vegan stir-fry 
sauce made with yeast extract and kombu. It imparts a similar umami boost that fish sauce usually brings to 
dishes, without the fish!

Ready in under 10 minutes, you can heat it up in the microwave or on the stovetop. And because it's easy to 
prepare, we think it will solve your ""what's for breakfast and lunch?"" quandary, too. Try topping the Cabbage 
with a fried egg for breakfast or toss it with rice for a quick lunch. It goes splendidly with a variety of proteins 
and makes a grand addition to soups. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, try our Stir Fried Garlicky 
Cabbage as an easy filling for homemade dumplings.

we've always found the act of eating corn on the cob to be a lot of fun, in and of itself. So when we found out 
there was a way to make that treasured activity even more fun (and even more delicious, to boot!), we jumped 
at the opportunity (and for joy) to bring in Trader Joe's Seasoned Corn Ribs to our freezers. Made with plant-
based butter and just the right amount of salt, these deliciously buttery, and decidedly vegan ""Ribs"" are as 
corny as you can get, in all the best ways.

They're made for us by a supplier in Italy, who slices cobs of corn into quarters and then lightly cooks them 
until they naturally take on a slightly curved, barbecued rib-like shape. After that, they season them with salt 
and an olive oil and cocoa butter-based vegan butter, before flash freezing them and sending them our way. 
They can be prepared in a manner of minutes in your microwave, or a little longer in the oven or air fryer, and 
make a fantastic plant-based side for all kinds of fare, barbecue or otherwise. For some extra flavor and elotes-

"061122","Mini Hold The Cone Peppermint Flavor","Earlier this year, we re-introduced our Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones. This reintroduction involved 
improvements in a number of areas. We improved the quality of the ice cream and the cones, we moved the 
production from Germany to the U.S. (which speeds up delivery time and keeps the cone crisper), and we 
increased the total weight in each package without increasing the cost. Manufacturing these domestically 
allowed us to create some new flavor combinations, including this Peppermint Flavored Hold the Cone!

Identical in size and shape to their Chocolate, Vanilla, and Pumpkin Ginger cousins, Peppermint Flavored 
Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones are nonetheless unique - and uniquely delicious. They begin with 
crispy sugar cones that are made with just enough chocolate to impart a real, noticeable chocolate-y flavor. The 
cones are filled with rich and creamy peppermint ice cream made with natural peppermint flavor and other 
natural flavors. And the ice cream is crowned with a sweet chocolate-y coating, an ideal counterpart to this 
treat's minty profile.

Peppermint Flavored Hold the Cone! Mini Ice Cream Cones can be found in our freezers for a limited time

Rolls that take about ten minutes in the oven to go from frozen to delicately browned and delightfully chewy.

Equally excellent for holiday feasts and everyday dining, Trader Joe's Pão D'Àgua Rolls make an able addition 
to almost any meal. They're lovely when spread with salted butter, delectable when torn into chunks and dunked 
into seasoned olive oil, and make great buns for some teeny tiny sandwiches when sliced in half laterally

"072949","Korean Beefless Bulgogi","The word bulgogi literally means ""fire meat"" in Korean. The meat of choice in this popular dish is typically beef, 
sliced into thin strips, marinated in bulgogi sauce (basically a doctored soy sauce), and ""fired"" on a grill. We 
love this dish, and have explored some of our own versions, like Trader Joe's Korean Inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried 
Rice with Kimchi [sku 67480] to name just one. Continuing our exploration, we've chosen some less traditional 
territory in the creation of Trader Joe's Korean Beefless Bulgogi.

The fire ""meat"" in this case is not meat at all. Instead, it's 100% Beefless textured soy protein. Even so, the 
marinade is quite traditional, made by our Korean supplier (in the Republic of Korea) using common bulgogi-
sauce ingredients, such as soy sauce, pear puree, garlic, ginger, green onions, and sugar. Though completely 
vegan, the texture of our Beefless Bulgogi is satisfyingly meat-like; and the savory, sweet, salty sauce adds 
authenticity (not to mention enjoyability!) to the whole eating experience.

Korean Beefless Bulgogi cooks from frozen in 3-7 minutes, depending on your chosen method. Serve it with 
a side of Organic Jasmine Rice [63573], or in a stir fry with your favorite TJ's veggies. Since we've already gone 
non-traditional, why not take it a step further and pack some TJ's tortillas with this Bulgogi for truly inspired, 
totally meatless tacos?!

"073857","Bulgur Pilaf with Butternut Squash & Feta Cheese","Drawing inspiration from the dish known across Greece and Cyprus as pilafi pourgouri, Trader Joe's Bulgur 
Pilaf with Butternut Squash and Feta Cheese is a side dish for the ages. Each batch starts with a base of light, 
nutty bulgur wheat, which our supplier seasons with aromatic spices like thyme and turmeric. They then cook it 
in a mild vegetable broth with bits of sweet and earthy butternut squash until the bulgur takes on a tender, easy-
going texture, before finally tossing it all with chunks of tart, tangy, feta cheese. Each forkful offers a variety of 
textures, from the soft bite of the squash, to the fluffiness of the bulgur, and the teeth-sinking satisfaction of the 
feta, all bound together by a delightfully savory flavor profile that pairs excellently with practically any protein.

In contrast to the pleasant complexity of its texture and flavor, this Bulgur Wheat couldn't be simpler to 
prepare: just a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop are all you need to serve it nice and hot. That 
said, it can also be enjoyed cold, a bit like a tabbouleh, by emptying the bag into a bowl and allowing it to thaw 
in the fridge overnight. Either way, it pairs most deliciously with a hearty Mediterranean-inspired main course, 
like grilled Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667], pan-fried Gyro Slices [sku 55277], or yogurt-marinaded 
salmon kebabs.

from tacos and enchiladas to grilled seafood and roast chicken. Of course, like any hall-of-fame worthy side, 
it can be a bit time-consuming to prepare from scratch. That's why we're proud to offer Trader Joe's Spanish

to your dinner plate in a manner of minutes.

Seriously, all it takes is about 4¿ minutes in the microwave or a little longer in a hot skillet to make two steamy 
servings of tender, toothsome, perfectly spiced Spanish Style Rice. With all that prep work out of the way, 
you'll have all the more time to focus on what kind of dish to accessorize with this flavorful, fragrant Rice. We

"003663","Chicken Gyoza Potstickers","According to culinary historians, gyoza (""jiaozi"" in Mandarin) were invented by the Chinese. It's rumored that 
the potsticker came to be when a Chinese chef walked away from the stove while gyoza were boiling, the water 
boiled off, and the stuffed dumplings stuck to the wok. The crisped side proved to be quite pleasing. 

We love good food stories as much as we love good dumplings, so once upon a time, we developed our very 
own Chicken Gyoza Potstickers. These crescent-shaped dumplings are made from wheat flour wrappers that 
enfold a flavorful  filling of chicken, cabbage and onion, seasoned with soy sauce, sesame seed oil and ginger 
powder. Already fully cooked, our Chicken Gyoza Potstickers easily fulfill your preparation preference - 
steam, pan fry,  microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the 
potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and 
crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the 
dumplings off the  pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone). Serve

"075010","Caramel Apple Mochi","When we first introduced Mochi ice cream to our freezers, way back in 2001, it was¿ kind of a big deal. 
We most certainly didn't invent the stuff, but we were one of the first grocery stores to offer it to customers 
nationwide-and it was love at first bite.

We've offered several different iterations of these chewy, rice dough-wrapped ice cream orbs over the years, 
and for our latest, Trader Joe's Caramel Apple Mochi, we've taken inspiration from a true autumnal icon: 
the beloved Caramel Apple. To be specific, we've infused each scoop of ice cream with bits of sweet, luscious 
caramel, apple purée, apple juice concentrate, and natural caramel & apple flavors. Then, we've wrapped said 
scoops in chewy, caramel-hued rice dough. The end result? A batch of two-or-three-bite-sized balls of (literal) 
melt-in-your-mouth fall flavor! Bobbing for Mochi, anyone?

"029963","Organic Super Sweet Cut Corn","Trader Joe's Organic Corn is very likely the sweetest, crunchiest and freshest-tasting off-the-cob Corn you'll 
find anywhere. This corn is Supersweet, it contains up to twice the amount of sweetness as standard varieties 
and may be harvested and stored over a longer period of time. No doubt this corn is sweet... Supersweet to be 
exact, and it's organic, already cut, and flash frozen - store in your freezer, cook what you need, save the rest 
for later, and repeat. 

Obviously, corn is one of the more versatile ingredients in your pantry. You hardly need suggestions for Corn, 
right? But we'd be remiss if we didn't give you one just the same. Toss a bag of our Corn in the microwave or 
on the stove top until heated through. Add as a sweet side dish or for a Mexican-style salad. Or if you're feeling 
creative, add in a cup with Real Mayonnaise [sku 01482], grated Cotija Cheese [sku 65005], chile, and crushed 
Elote Chips [sku 60564]. What a simple bag of Trader Joe's Organic Supersweet Cut Corn can do. And its 
price of just $1.79* a bag will have you stocking your freezer.

"071651","Gluten Free Breaded Shrimp","When creating a gluten free version of a typically gluten-ful dish, the element that's most important-and, 
usually, the most challenging-to get correct is the texture. So we take it quite seriously when we tell you that 
every bite of Trader Joe's Gluten Free Breaded Shrimp starts with the same satisfying crunch from the exterior 
coating, and ends with the same tender, toothsome interior as you'd expect from gluten-based breaded shrimp. 

What's the secret? Our supplier, a specialist in seafood snacks like this, applies an especially light and crispy 
coating made mostly from coconut flour and tapioca starch to each shrimp before lightly frying. They arrive 
in our freezers fully cooked, meaning all you need to do on your end is just give them a few minutes in the 
frying pan, oven, or air fryer before enjoying. We particularly like them as a protein for Baja-style tacos, surf 
'n' turf burritos, or a fun and flavorful rice bowl with steamed veggies and a bit of Sriracha [sku 50828]. They 
also make a delicious snack in their own right, espeically when dunked in or drizzled with a mixture of mayo 
and Sweet Chili Sauce [sku 91113].

for the freezer instead. That's because we've tapped into a new, limited-edition Ice Cream flavor that is sure to 
become a fast favorite-Salted Maple! Mmmm... mmmaple.

Made by the same supplier responsible for some of our past holiday hits, Trader Joe's Salted Maple Ice Cream 
is a gloriously thick, decadently creamy, and decidedly rich ice cream flavored with real Maple syrup and 
balanced with a sprinkle of sea salt. To really elevate its sweet and salty excellence, we've also imbued it with a 
Salted Maple-flavored swirl throughout. Mmmm... mmmaple. 

This Ice Cream is simply sublime all on its own, but you can give it the sundae treatment with walnuts, whipped 
cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Or try a scoop with your morning stack of pancakes for an exceptional 
breakfast, or with a handful of Maple Sea Salt Kettle Popcorn [sku 66056] for an extra pop of texture and crunch. 
You can even serve a scoop atop a warm Pumpkin Sticky Tofee Cake [sku 74633]. For a limited time, you can 
pick up a pint of Trader Joe's Salted Maple Ice Cream in our freezers for $3.49. Mmmm... you know the rest.

of it, croissants are a crucial customer favorite as well¿which is why this year's holiday tasting panel didn't 
need much convincing to vote ""yea"" on Trader Joe's Pumpkin Cheesecake Croissants at the 2022 fall & 
holiday tasting panel (yes, it's a panel devoted entirely to the fall & holiday seasons, and yes, it's as wondrous as 
it sounds).

But back to the Croissants: Our supplier starts with a roughly four-inch square of all-butter croissant dough, 
topped with a scoop of impossibly creamy, cheesecake-inspired filling consisting of cream cheese, pastry 
cream, and velvety pumpkin purée. Bake from frozen in a 350°F oven for 25-30 minutes (that's enough time to 
enjoy a leisurely cup of Pumpkin Spice Coffee [sku 97234]), and you'll be rewarded with warm, flaky, pleasantly 
sweet Pumpkin Cheesecake Croissants without needing to take a trip to a corner bakery. And if that weren't 
enough, they're a tremendous value, too: each box, containing two delicious Croissants, sells for about the 
same price you'd pay for a single croissant at that aforementioned bakery. Incroyable!

"074560","Banana Pudding Flavored Ice Cream","Calling all banana fans! The latest entry into our seasonal ice cream lineup is sure to have a certain appeal 
for you. Made for us by the same supplier as some of our other (widely celebrated, if we do say so ourselves) 
seasonal ice cream pints, each bite of Trader Joe's Banana Pudding Flavored Ice Cream expertly evokes the 
taste of a classically sweet and creamy banana pudding. In fact, every batch even contains bite-sized bits of 
vanilla-flavored wafer cookies to provide the same delightful textural element as you'd find in banana pudding 
dishes at potluck dessert tables across the country. We're not just saying you'll love it-we're saying you'll love 
it a whole bunch. (We'll see ourselves out, thank you.)

In addition to the previously mentioned wafer cookies, our supplier deftly flavors this Ice Cream with banana 
purée to provide a perfect banana baseline, as well as a rich salted caramel swirl to tie everything else together. 
While it makes an excellent anytime treat, we find that it's best enjoyed as a satisfyingly sweet reward at the end 
of a hot summer day. And if you really want to take things to the next level, you can treat it like a deconstructed, 
reconstructed banana split and top it with whipped cream, your favorite chopped nuts, and one of our Dark 
Chocolate Covered Cherries [sku 50631].

many parts of the Caribbean, and more broadly throughout much of the Jamaican diaspora, a good Jamaican 
beef patty is made with spicy, savory-seasoned ground beef, encased in a gloriously buttery, flaky, and crispy 
crust-a true feast for the senses. And a great Jamaican beef patty is prety darn near life-changing. Made for us 
by an expert supplier well-versed in flaky pastry-covered delights, we're elated to offer Trader Joe's Jamaican 
Style Beef Patties as an edible tribute to this spicy street food super star.

Each bite of a freshly heated Jamaican Style Beef Patty starts with the rich, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth pastry 
crust, which gets its warm, golden hue courtesy of turmeric. After that, you're treated to the tender texture of 
the ground beef inside, which is seasoned with rich and aromatic spices like curry powder, fenugreek, and 
cayenne. They're hearty enough to make either a light meal or filling snack, and, conveniently, can be prepared 
in the oven, microwave, or air fryer. We recommend pairing with a drink that will cut through some of the 
spice, like a sweet, refreshing 100% Mango Juice [sku 56933] or a frosty glass of Drive Thru Red Ale [sku 61149].

"073998","Instant Boba Kit","Since its creation in Taiwan in the 1980s, boba has become a genuinely global phenomenon-and if you're 
lucky enough to live near a boba shop, you'll know exactly why. Simultaneously sweet, refreshing, and texturally 
satisfying, a typical sip of a boba drink starts with the cool rush of iced, sweetened, and often fabulously 
flavored milk (or a comparable non-dairy beverage) and ends on a delightfully chewy note, courtesy of the 
tapioca pearls (A.K.A. boba) that mingle at the bottom of the cup. It's a taste-texture combo that serves as an 
ideal anytime treat, especially when combined with a savory snack. And now, thanks to Trader Joe's Instant 
Boba Kit, it can be enjoyed from the comforts of your very own home.
 
For right about the same price you'd pay for a single boba drink at a café, each Boba Kit contains four pouches 
of tapioca pearls flavored with rich brown sugar, which take only a minute in the microwave to heat up. From 
there, it's just a matter of mixing into a glass of your preferred milk or non-dairy alternative, adding ice, and 
enjoying. Why, we've even included a wide-gauge paper straw to go along with each pouch to make sure you 
can capture a few boba with every sip. For an unbeatable savory-sweet combo, we recommend pairing a tall, 
icy glass with a basket of crispy Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets [sku 52805].

"051530","Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings","Sometimes, it's good to eat old food. Mind you, we're not talking about food that's been stashed and 
forgotten for weeks in the back of the fridge. Think recipes with rich and storied histories. Trader 
Joe's Vegetable Biryani with Vegetable Dumplings is based on a traditional South Asian recipe that's 
been celebrated in the Indian region for five centuries. And, it's made with ingredients that have been 
enjoyed for thousands of years!

Traditional Biryani is Basmati rice, steamed separately and layered with vegetables and/or meat that 
have been pan-fried with an intricate blend of aromatic, dry spices. Once combined, the mixture is 
finished in the oven. Because we like you, we've undertaken this multi-step cooking process for you-
leaving just two things for you to do: heat and eat!

Our Biryani is 100% vegetarian, including the tender ""kofta"" or dumplings, which provide a textural 
contrast to the firm rice and veggies. As is customary, we've thrown in some sweet raisins and sliced 
cashews. This diverse blend of traditional ingredients yields an exciting exploration into the flavors 
and textures of South Asia. For $2.49, the 10-ounce package easily serves as a full meal for one per-
son. Otherwise, you might share it as a side dish, accompanied by green curry, yogurt chutney, and

tell you that our Mint Chip Ice Cream is packed with pleasing peppermint flavor and melt-in-your mouth 
chocolate chips.

We love to focus on quality ingredients with all of our products, and Trader Joe's Mint Chip Ice Cream 
does not deviate. A simple mixture of cream, milk, sugar, egg yolks, fudge chips, peppermint extract, and 
just two thickening agents make up this decadent dessert, which basically means if we happened to make a 
batch directly in your home, it'd be as pure as homemade churned ice cream! And notice that super premium 
designation? To get there, an ice cream must have less than 50% overrun, meaning that one gallon of mix 
would create no more than one and a half gallons of finished ice cream. Trader Joe's Mint Chip Ice Cream

Created as an easily portable food to be used for hunting trips, large group travel, and a food source for armies, 
the tamale was considered sacred; a food of the gods. While we don't use our Cheese & Green Chile Tamales

at least the average shopper. We've been happily serving this Central American dish in traditional fashion

Cheese & Green Chile Tamales directly after preparation so you can enjoy the rich and savory corn masa

"092157","Sweet Potato Fries","Nowadays, Sweet Potato Frites are ubiquitous (okay, sure, most folks call them fries); from gastropubs to fast 
food joints, and yes, grocery store freezer cases. When we first introduced them, however, they were much less 
common - so uncommon in fact, that there were some that called us foolhardy (that can happen). We do like 
a good risk, yet questions remained: Would the traditionalists bite? Would the non-fry folks even consider 
entering the fry fray?  Years on, we have our unequivocal answers:  yes and yes! We won't attempt to take credit 
for any kind of trend-setting here, but we will boast of having the best sweet potato fries you can get out of 
a freezer (and it's worth noting, most of the sweet potato fries you've had in restaurants have come from the 
freezer, too).

Trader Joe's Sweet Potato Frites are bright, golden-orange spears of sweet potato with the skins removed. 
They're steam blanched and par-fried before being frozen, so they retain their fresh flavor and vibrant color. They 
bake to a crisp exterior that yields to a creamy-yet-still-slightly-firm interior. They're mildly sweet (naturally), 
excellent with all kinds of dips - ketchup, mustard, ranch, sriracha, barbecue sauce, mayo, chili sauce¿

"073330","Layered Beef Tostada","Recently, a certain fast food taco chain ""ran out"" of one of its most popular menu items. Luckily, Trader Joe's 
customers who are craving this elusive entrée will now be able to enjoy the TJ's version of this Mexican-style 
delight! And we believe Trader Joe's Layered Beef Tostada surpasses the original on numerous levels.

Speaking of levels, our Layered Beef Tostada takes one toasted flour tortilla (tostada literally means ""toasted""), 
and stacks it with typical taco ingredients, and then another toasted flour tortilla. Between the two tortillas, 
there's enchilada sauce and savory ground beef, with seasonings that include cumin, paprika, onion, oregano, 
and cayenne. There are also whole pinto beans (rather than refried), along with two different kinds of cheese: 
Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Finally, the top toasted tortilla is itself topped with diced tomatoes, sliced black 
olives, green onions, and more cheese. Delicious!

Though preparing Trader Joe's Layered Beef Tostada may not be quite as effortless as cruising through the 
drive-thru, we can honestly say that it's really quite easy and fairly fast. Simply preheat your conventional oven 
to 425°F, remove the packaging, and place the Tostada on a lined baking sheet for 15 to 18 minutes. (If you 
have an air fryer, you can cut your cook time in half!) Either way, you'll be rewarded with crispy tortillas, melty 
cheese, and a whole lotta Tostada flavor!

"078580","Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream","This is why people scream for ice cream. Trader Joe's Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream is, in our most humble 
opinion, the very best coffee ice cream available anywhere on planet Earth. Or beyond, on other planets whose 
populations value ice cream. Lest you think we hyperbolize - which we would never, ever do - we're about to 
tell you exactly what makes this ice cream so special.

First and foremost, our Coffee Bean Blast Ice Cream has very low overrun. Overrun, in ice cream speak, is the 
amount of air that's whipped into the ice cream - the higher the overrun, the lower quality the ice cream. (This 
one comes in at 25.56% overrun.) Because there is so little air in this ice cream, it is thicker, richer and creamier 
than lesser quality ice creams, a direct result of its 15% butterfat content. And then there's the flavor. Big WOW 
here. Some coffee ice creams have a little coffee flavor - some don't even use actual coffee. Our Coffee Bean 
Blast Ice Cream features big, bold, intense coffee flavor that comes from brewed Colombian coffee and bits of 
very finely ground French Roast Colombian coffee beans in every bite.

"073692","Watermelon & Peach Macarons","Macarons are uncommonly elegant treats any time of year, but there's something particularly wonderful 
about enjoying them on a sunny summer's day. That's why we've introduced Trader Joe's Watermelon & Peach 
Macarons for the season. Made for us by the same expert bakers in Belgium behind our Valentine's 
Day-exclusive Heart Shaped Macarons [sku 69881], these sweet, summer-y treats combine the luxurious 
texture of sweet, meringue-y macarons with two fruits that are practically synonymous with summer: ripe, 
flavorful peach, and juicy, refreshing watermelon.

Perfect for a summer picnic, afternoon tea, or simply enjoying as a sweet, fruity snack, our picturesquely pastel 
Watermelon & Peach Macarons pair superlatively well with a cup of hot tea, a frosty glass of lightly flavored 
mineral water, or a flute of your favorite sparkling wine. They add great visual flair when ser ved alongside a 
light, tasty sorbet or a plate of sliced fresh fruit, and only require minimal prep before they're ready to eat: 
simply allow them to sit at room temperature for about one hour before serving.

"074250","Blueberry Dream Frozen Dessert Bars","We sell a staggering amount of blueberries at Trader Joe's, especially during the summer months. In fact, 
truckloads would not be an inaccurate description of the amount. This got our buyer to thinking-how can we 
bring customers even more of these beloved little berries, at the height of the season? You could say the answer 
came to them in the form of a dream: Trader Joe's Blueberry Dream Frozen Dessert Bars, to be more precise.

These frozen delights get a double dose of blueberry deliciousness thanks to sweet, ripe blueberries and 
unsweetened blueberry juice. Blending the aforementioned berries and juice with a rich, ice cream-esque base 
(including milk, cream, and egg yolks) and a touch of cane sugar yields a velvety, deep violet-hued Frozen 
Dessert Bar possessing truly intense blueberry flavor. If you're looking for ways to make your Blueberry 
Dreams come true this summer, these sweet, kosher-certified treats are sure to satisfy as an afternoon snack or 
after-dinner treat, from the first lick to the last, enthusiastic bite. Find them in our freezers, for a limited time.

"074215","Out of this World Ice Pops","Everyone has their own, personal sense-memories of the summer season, but a few, we'd argue, are universal.
The smell of the grill at a backyard BBQ¿ The crackling of fireworks on the 4th of July... The jingle-jangle of 
the ice cream truck, making its way around the bend, with a trove of frozen treats in tow... Ah, yes. Summer! 

At TJ's, we've already got the grill covered, and now, we're bringing you the ice cream truck, too, with Trader 
Joe's Out of This World Ice Pops! (We'll leave the fireworks to the experts¿) These little red, white, and 
blue rockets feature a layer of lemon ice (made with lemon juice concentrate,) a layer of blueberry ice (made 
with blueberry purée and colored with fruit juice & spirulina extract), and a layer of strawberry ice (made 
with strawberry purée and colored with veggie juice.) They're just like those Americana-esque Ice Pops you 
remember, minus the artificial colors and flavors you'd rather forget. Out of This World, eh?

If you're ready to be rocketed into a new dimension of summertime satisfaction, pick up a box of Trader Joe's 
Out of This World Ice Pops today! Much like this sunny weather, these Pops won't be around forever¿

"074184","Horchata Ice Cream","The popular Latin American beverage called horchata [or-cha-ta] is creamy and sweet, like ice cream. With no 
good excuse not to, we decided to take it all the way there-from smooth beverage to frozen dessert! Trader 
Joe's Horchata Inspired Ice Cream delivers all the delicious flavors of horchata in every spoonful.

Like many ice creams, its rich base includes cream, milk, egg yolks, and cane sugar. We horchatized it by adding 
cinnamon and brown rice flour, plus a touch of sea salt. And since inclusions are fun, we also added pieces of 
horchata-flavored cookies, contributing a nice textural variation.

Unlike the beverage, you probably won't be having Horchata Ice Cream right alongside your taco plate-
though we wouldn't dare stop you! Instead, may we recommend it as a wonderful, post-Mexican-meal treat? 
Of course, you could really shake things up by blending a couple scoops with milk to make this Horchata Ice 
Cream drinkable, in homage to its inspiration. Whatever you do, do it quickly since our supply of Trader Joe's 
Horchata Ice Cream is limited, and probably won't last all summer!

"051367","Uncooked Ground Buffalo Burgers","It's back!  Trader Joe's Buffalo 
Burgers.  It takes about 26 months 
for a bison to reach maturity. The 
buffalo grow on three large, open 
prairie ranches in Canada and the 
U.S.  They are given a choice of 
whole grains and free range grazing 
on prairie grass.  Buffalo, unlike 
cattle, will naturally select what they 
wish to eat and they never consume 
more than their bodies require.  
There are several benefits of buffalo 
meat: lower in saturated fat than 
other red meats, tender due to a 
""stress free"" environment, and no 
additives, antibiotics, hormone and 
stimulant free.  It's versatile and easy 
to prepare.  Since buffalo is lean, it 
cooks much faster than beef. 
 
We are selling a 16 oz. box of Trader

"073594","Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries","We've got quite a cache of prominant potato products populating our freezers at present. From fries to hashbrowns 
to tots, we've got tubers totally covered¿ or so we thought. Recently, after a trip to a favorite fast-food joint, our 
Buyer was struck by a spud-tacular realization: we. need. Waffle. Cut. Fries. So, she reached out to the Italian 
supplier of our revered Roasted Potatoes, Peppers & Onions [sku 55969], and the rest is French-fried history.

Allow us to introduce the latest tater on the block: Trader Joe's Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries. Our supplier starts 
with sliced potatoes, then gives said slices that wonderful Waffle Cut. We can't share the top-secret technology 
behind this marvel of geometry (a spud never reveals its secrets), but we can say that the cut itself adds a certain 
je ne sais quoi to the overall fry-eating experience. Next, these waffle-like potatoes are coated in a flour-based 
batter, fried in vegetable oil, and, finally, seasoned with a blend of salt, paprika, black pepper, yeast extract, and 
garlic, onion & chili powders. (Bonus: there's seasoning in the batter, too!)

Whether you bake them in the oven or crisp them in the air-fryer, enjoy them solo or dip 'em in your favorite 
sauce¿ Trader Joe's Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries are where it's at. So don't wait, don't waiver, and don't waffle-

Cone! Yes, you read that right: Cheesecake. In. A. Cone. Though they may look like little ice cream cones, 
Trader Joe's Mini Cheesecake Cones are assuredly not ice cream. Made for us in Italy, they are little, hand-held 
almond Florentine cones (picture sweet, praline-like Florentine cookies that have been rolled up into cones) 
filled with a thick, velvety-sweet cheesecake filling made from a heavenly blend of buffalo's milk ricotta & quark 
cheese (a fresh & tangy cheese with a nifty name.) 

Since our Trader Joe's Mini Cheesecake Cones are so handy for holding, they make an easy anytime snack or 
after-dinner treat, especially at parties. (It only takes 20 minutes or so to defrost them at room temperature so 
you can have them ready for your guests before they've even finished dinner.) We're selling each 7.05-ounce

more in-demand dessert option in our freezers right about now. Trader Joe's Wildberry Cheesecake Ice 
Cream combines the aforementioned ice-cold aspect of ice cream with the sweet, fleeting nature of summer 
wild berries and bits of cheesecake. 

That's right: in addition to a dreamy, sweet-cream ice cream base, you'll find a generous mixed berry swirl (made 
with blueberries, elderberry juice concentrate, and a blend of raspberry, strawberry & blackberry purees)  and 
chewy bits of classic cheesecake. We're talking plenty of berry-and-cream-cheese contrast here, folks. And if 
it sounds like the dessert of your dreams, don't delay! Much like a cool breeze on a hot  summer's day, or like 
berry season itself, Trader Joe's Wildberry Cheesecake Ice Cream's presence in our stores will only last so

better way to mix things up than to take our classic New York Deli Style Cheesecake [sku 31185] out for a Swirl? 
Made using the same creamy cheesecake base and sweet, crumbly graham cracker crust as our aforementioned 
freezer favorite, Trader Joe's Strawberry Swirl Cheesecake sweetens the deal via the addition of bold, red 
ribbons of spiraling strawberry filling. With every bite, the nimble tartness of the cheesecake, the lush sweetness 
of the strawberry, and the tender texture of the crust intermingle to create one serious seasonal treat.

This Cheesecake isn't just delicious, it's downright convenient, too: All you need to do to prepare it is simply let 
it thaw, a process that takes an hour or two at room temp, or overnight in the fridge. From there, you're free to 
slice and serve as you see fit, by itself or topped with fresh strawberries, strawberry preserves, or even a bit of 
shaved white or dark chocolate. For a limited time, we're selling these 30-ounce, six-serving Strawberry Swirl 
Cheesecakes for the oh-so-sweet retail of $7.99* - less than the price of a slice at most restaurants, we might 
add. While supplies last, you can find them in the dessert section of our freezer case.

Dill Pickle Mini Falafel-vegan, garbanzo-based Falafel that get pepped up with an herby brightness from 
their partner, the Dill Pickle. One bite, and you'll discover a pairing so harmonious, you'd think they were 
always meant to be enjoyed together. We really wanted to reach peak pickle here, so we've taken it a step further 
and used the pickle brine to hydrate the falafel mix. Pickle-posterous? Maybe. Delicious? Definitely! 

These Mini Falafel are supremely snackable, and ready to heat and eat on their own. Each 12-ounce bag 
contains about 40 Mini Falafel -so you can try them in an array of pickle-y preparations. You could add them 
to a mezze platter, or atop a salad for a pop of mouth-puckering protein. Pack them in a Pita [sku 53212] with 
Dill Pickle Hummus [sku 66803] and mixed greens for a tangy twist on the classic. For an extra pickle-y punch,

enjoy slow-cooked beef in a flavorful, savory broth made with crushed tomatoes, dried chiles, and aromatic 
spices until incredibly tender, without rolling up your sleeves? Now you can, with Trader Joe's Beef Birria.

This Mexican dish originally hails from Jalisco, and, like ours, is traditionally cooked for several hours in kettles 
until the Beef is incredibly tender and infused with a savory tomato and chile sauce. You can serve it as a simple 
stew, topped with fresh cilantro, diced onions, and a squeeze of lime. Alternatively, if you want to evoke the 
taco truck vibe-and we're thinking you will-make your own Birria tacos! Dip Corn Tortillas [sku 92394] in 
the broth and fry them in a hot pan or on a plancha. Add the Birria, top with chopped onions, cilantro, and a 
squeeze of lime, then fold and fry on each side until crispy. But don't stop there-that lusciously spiced broth 
serves as a delectable dip for your tacos, too. Believe us, you'll want to spoon, dip, and sip every last drop.

"096766","Premium Salmon Burgers","Sometimes a burger is just a burger, and sometimes it's so much more. Trader Joe's Premium Salmon Burgers 
most definitely fall into the ""so much more"" category.  What makes them so special? They're made with wild 
pink salmon fished from the icy cold waters of Alaska.  The fish are fully skinned and deboned, then gently 
seasoned with such goodies as mirepoix-the classic combination of carrots, celery and onions-and sea salt. 
They are formed into patties and quick frozen-this locks in moisture and super salmon flavor, resulting in a 
truly sensational, mild-tasting (read: never fishy), flaky burger. You don't even need to thaw them; you can grill 
them from frozen with excellent results. No grill? No problem. Cook them in the oven or on the stovetop with 
equal ease. Serve them on buns with all the traditional burger accouterments, crumbled over a garden salad, or 
as center-of-the-plate for a protein-packed repast.

straight from the freezer, onto a baking sheet, and into a cold oven. There's no preheating required - set your

"069352","Portuguese Custard Tarts","As the old cliché goes, necessity is the mother of invention, but there's something to be said about the parental 
capabilities of simple practicality, too. For example: a few centuries back, monks and nuns in Portugal began 
using egg whites to starch their habits, which created a real surplus of egg yolks within monasteries. Rather 
than let them go to waste, they began developing yolk-centered desserts, the most successful of which came 
to be known as pastel de nata, or, as its known throughout the rest of the world, the Portuguese Custard Tart.

While our Custard Tarts may come from less purely practical origins, they are imported from Portugal and 
prominently feature the same creamy texture and flaky, melt-in-your-mouth crust that have made this dessert 
a favorite in bakeries the world over. Preparation is as simple as 20 minutes in the oven, 15 in the air fryer, or 
55 seconds for a single Tart in the microwave. Once hot and ready, they're especially delicious when sprinkled 
with a bit of cinnamon and paired with a steaming cup of coffee or tea. Speaking of practical, our spring-
seasonal Trader Joe's Portuguese Custard Tarts are sure to practically fly out of our freezers, so be sure to pick 
up a 7.05-ounce box (containing four Tarts) while supplies last.

"072104","Tres Leches Cake","Tres leches cake is as quintessentially Latin American a dessert as you'll ever find. Broadly beloved across 
cultures ranging through North, Central, and South America, a classic tres leches is typically made with a 
light, airy sponge cake that's been soaked with a mix of three kinds of milk: heavy cream, evaporated milk, 
and sweetened condensed milk. That, plus a crowning layer of whipped cream, is the formula we follow with  
Trader Joe's Tres Leches Cake, a quick, convenient, thaw-and-serve tribute to this classic confection.

Sweet, soft, and refreshing with every dairy-saturated bite, our Tres Leches Cake comes frozen and only 
requires a few hours resting at room temperature (or an overnight stay in your refrigerator) before it's ready 
to serve. We find that it makes an ideal dessert option for the spring holidays, especially when adorned with 
slices of your favorite fresh fruit, or even just a quick sprinkling of cinnamon powder. Enjoy as an after-dinner, 
after-brunch, or after-anytime treat with a cup of coffee or black tea.

"056018","Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese","Like the unique sweetness of Vidalia Onions from Vidalia, Georgia (U.S.A.); or the richer flavor of San Mar-
zano Tomatoes from San Marzano sul Sarno, near Naples, Italy; Hatch Chiles-grown in Hatch Valley, New 
Mexico-are special for the place from which they come. To borrow a wine making term, the terroir (or total 
natural environs) of southwestern New Mexico is what makes Hatch Chiles so special. When roasted with care, 
they are earthy, sweet, and spicy (ranging from mild to medium heat) with an alluring smokiness.

Mac & Cheese, another American favorite, is beloved not so much for its terroir (after all, it is made all over the 
place!), but more for its concept. Who wouldn't love pasta doused in a rich, creamy, cheese sauce?

It wasn't a big leap, then, to marry these two foods together, and Trader Joe's Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese 
proves it's a match made in Heaven (that most coveted, if only metaphorical, terroir). We coat semolina elbow 
macaroni in a rich, creamy, cheese sauce made from aged Cheddar, milk, and butter. Then, we notch it up with 
authentic Hatch Chiles, roasted, chopped, and mixed in for a welcoming, smoky-heat.

For a satisfying full meal, heat our Hatch Chile Mac & Cheese from frozen in the ovenable tray, in either the 
microwave or conventional oven (directions on the package). It also makes a terrific side dish, especially next 
to our Pork Rib Bites [sku 53236], or another one of our BBQ'd, pulled meats (Beef Brisket [sku 93605], Chicken 
[sku 93603], or Pork [sku 93602]). The 12 ounce, two serving box is $2.99, and only available at Trader Joe's.

be eaten raw, roasted, baked, fried, sautéed, or even flambéed. In Thailand, street vendors use native Namwa

"074092","When Life Gives You Lemons Make Ice Cream","Is there a fruit that gets a worse rap, rhetorically, than the humble lemon? In addition to being used to refer to 
defective devices and automobiles, it's featured prominently (and rather pejoratively) in an age-old adage about 
making the best of a bad situation - simply because it's sour! Well, we've had enough of such citric slander. In 
response, we're introducing Trader Joe's When Life Gives You Lemons Make Ice Cream, a sweet, creamy, and 
delightfully tart frozen treat to serve as the seasonal celebration that lemons so richly deserve.

Unlike the idiom that inspired its name, When Life Gives You Lemons is an example of making a great 
situation even better. Starting with a base of sweet, velvety ice cream that's been flavored with lemon juice and 
lemon zest, our supplier mixes in bits of buttery shortbread cookies to provide some textural contrast, then 
adds a bright yellow lemon swirl for even more citrus-y zing. Every spoonful is tart and sweet without ever 
becoming sharp or cloying, and with just enough toothsomeness from the shortbread bits to keep the palate 
engaged. It makes an excellent ice cream for scooping into a cone on a warm spring day, or for constructing 
superbly sweet and sour sundaes.

"062899","Egg Frittata","A recent review of our frozen products revealed that while we had a sizeable number of breakfast options available 
for customers, they skewed to the light and fluffy (read: carb-tastic), such as waffles, pancakes, and croissants. And 
while there's nothing wrong with waffles, pancakes, or croissants, we felt there was an opportunity to bring in some 
lower carb, higher protein offerings to round out the set. To fill this gap and bolster your breakfasts, we are excited to 
welcome Trader Joe's Egg Frittata with Swiss Cheese & Cauliflower to our frozen case!

Made with a hearty base of 41% egg and 25% Swiss cheese, Trader Joe's Egg Frittata has a fluffy texture that belies 
its protein-packed ingredient list. Earthy cauliflower, fried onions, and the aforementioned cheese create the classic, 
belly-warming breakfast profile: craveably savory and utterly delicious. To amp up the protein content, our supplier 
uses egg whites, whole eggs, and whey protein concentrate-add it all up, and you get about 12 grams of protein and 
15% of your daily calcium needs, at just 5 grams of carbs per fully-cooked Frittata! 

To achieve peak Frittata perfection, simply reheat in the microwave or bake to your heart's (and your schedule's) 
content. Its plump disc shape makes it just the right size for an egg sandwich on a TJ's British Muffin [sku 14626/90558], 
with a slice of Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923], Fully Cooked Bacon [sku 86483], and a squirt of Sriracha Sauce [sku 
96923]. Or use two TJ's Hashbrowns [sku 96923] in place of the muffin for a crunchier, brunchier composition. On 
the other hand, if you're going for a lower carb concoction, set one of these Frittatas atop a bed of crisp salad greens 
dressed in vinaigrette, and you've got a satisfying meal on your hands, with hardly any fuss.

Seek out similar Frittatas elsewhere, and you'll find that artificial ingredients abound. We're offering 4.94-ounce 
boxes of two Trader Joe's Egg Frittata with Swiss Cheese & Cauliflower for $2.99-a value that's sure to have you 
waking up on the right side of the bed. Find them in our freezers.

"071551","Tteok Bok Ki","It wouldn't be much of an exaggeration to call tteok bok ki (pronounced tuk-bow-kee) food fit for royalty: the 
first historical records of this savory and satisfying rice cake dish come from a 19th century Korean cookbook, 
where it's cited as an example of court cuisine. Originally served in soy sauce, tteok bok ki took on its modern-
day red hue and sweet, peppery flavor profile via one chef 's introduction of gochujang sauce in the mid-20th 
century, and has since become a darling of Korean BBQ connoisseurs and street food aficionados the world 
over. And now, this rich, spicy delicacy of rather royal origins has found a new domain: The freezer aisle at your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's. Make way for Trader Joe's Tteok Bok Ki!

Made for us by a supplier in Korea, each package of Trader Joe's Tteok Bok Ki comes with a portion of bite-
sized rice cakes and a packet of fiery, gochujang-spiced sauce. Equally delicious as an appetizer, snack, or meal, 
especially when topped with a fried egg or freshly grilled Short Ribs [sku 90809]. They can be prepared in a 
more traditional manner, by boiling the rice cakes in water, adding the sauce, and simmering until thick, or 
made extra crispy by giving them a turn in the skillet or air fryer prior to incorporating the sauce. In either 
case, they'll have a delightfully chewy, almost mochi-like texture, and a bold, peppery heat which pairs well 
with an ice-cold soju or frosted glass of PLZNR Czech Style Lager [sku 97321].

"093417","Battered Fish Nuggets","A little batter, a lot of fish! Crispy, Trader Joe's Battered Fish Nuggets are lightly coated, briefly cooked in 
canola oil, and flash frozen, ready to oven bake for just about 15 to 18 minutes. The Nuggets are Alaska Pollock 
fish, a marine fish species of the cod family Gadidae. It's high in protein, about 12g per serving, and the white 
flesh is super juicy, moist, and flaky in texture. 

Fish Nuggets are perfect for fish tacos, just add a couple in Organic Flour and Corn Tortillas [sku 92402], 
topped with Green Shredded Cabbage [sku 92238], and Cilantro Salad Dressing [sku 36420] with a squeeze of 
lime. This would also be a great addition to a variety basket of battered Trader Joe's fish and chips, like Battered 
Halibut [sku 01237], Coconut Shrimp [sku 58803], and Handsome Cut Potato Fries [sku 96143] with Seafood 
Cocktail Sauce [sku 18757] and Tartar Sauce [sku 38108]. Trader Joe's Battered Fish Nuggets are an easy,

"052148","Vegetable Fried Rice","Frozen fried rice may sound like an oxymoron, but it is actually a brilliant time saver. Because of this convenience 
and its deliciousness, our Vegetable Fried Rice is a mainstay for many. It's packed with vegetables, including 
carrots, edamame, corn, green peas, leeks, and red bell pepper. Seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine, as well as 
some sugar, onions, seaweed, salt, and sesame oil - the medley offers rich, rounded flavor. Because the rice 
has already been cooked, it requires only a simple heating. A couple minutes in the microwave returns fluffy, 
tender grains, while a handful of minutes in a frying pan or wok (over medium heat) browns the grains and 
gives them a craveable crispness.  Delicious on its own, Vegetable Fried Rice is also a welcoming base for more 
veggies, fried tofu, TJ's Mandarin Orange Chicken [sku 66563] or TJ's Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef and Broccoli 
[sku 54448].

We're selling each 16-ounce package of Vegetable Fried Rice for $2.49*. Find it in our freezers.

"071519","Oat Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert Sandwiches","There's nothing quite like the feeling of coming home after a long day, nonchalantly peeking into your freezer, 
and suddenly remembering that you've got a box of ice cream sandwiches waiting for you. Or, rather, we should 
say that there used to be nothing quite like that, because with Trader Joe's Vanilla Oat Non-Dairy Frozen 
Dessert Sandwiches, that very same feeling can now be experienced with a veritably vegan version of that 
classic sweet treat! Each Sandwich is made with sweetened, vanilla-flavored, frozen oat beverage that's nestled 
between two sumptuously soft chocolate wafer cookies to deliver that satisfying, long-day-salvaging sensation 
with every bite.

A classic delight for kids and adults alike, these creamy and delicious Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert Sandwiches 
were made to be appreciated by vegans and non-vegans alike. They can be enjoyed straight out of the freezer as 
a spur-the-moment, individual indulgence, or brought out for the whole group to enjoy during a movie night, 
sleepover, or any other kind of get-together. We recommend keeping a box in your freezer as a just-in-case 
measure: you never know when the need for something sweet and nostalgia-inducing will arise, after all!

"072135","Okie Dokie Oat Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert","Here in the States, we might hear the term ""hokey pokey"" and start thinking about putting our left foot in, then 
our left foot out. But to folks in New Zealand, hokey pokey refers to a beloved sweet treat made from vanilla ice 
cream studded with bits of honeycomb toffee. One of our Buyers had the chance to try this regional delicacy, 
and was so overjoyed by its mix of sweet vanilla and resounding toffee crunch that we began working with a 
trusted supplier on our very own version-with a twist. 

Made from a base of vanilla-flavored oat beverage mixed with crunchy, spongey toffee pieces and a luxurious 
caramel swirl, we decided that this vegan interpretation of a Kiwi classic was different enough to warrant 
a new name. So, we said: Okie Dokie! Available in our freezers only for a limited time, this deliciously 
decadent Non-Dairy Frozen Dessert can be enjoyed in a cup, cone, or used to construct a veritably vegan 
sundae. And while we find that its silky ribbon of caramel and crunchy, non-dairy toffee bits offer plenty of 
textural variety, we're all for crumbling a cookie on top before serving. That's what it's all about, after all.

"066323","Root Vegetable Fries","Let's get right to the root of things: when it comes to creating crisp, delicious, supremely snackable fries, regular 
old potatoes are hardly the only tubers in town. In fact, as the constituent members of Trader Joe's Root 
Vegetable Fries demonstrate, there's a whole world of root veggies out there that fit the bill. Inside each 16-ounce 
bag, our supplier from Italy has assembled a mouthwatering medley of roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, 
and parsnips, that not only deliver on the crisp exterior and tender interior of a slender-cut French fry, but also 
add their inherent earthy sweetness into every bite. 

With just a few minutes in the oven or air fryer, these Root Vegetable Fries transform into an effortlessly 
elevated appetizer or accessory to burgers, steaks, or any number of savory entrées. They take particularly 
well to being modified with seasonings and spices, allowing you a large amount of leeway to experiment: try 
sprinkling generously with some of our Mushroom & Company [sku 63804], Ajika [sku 68324], or even some 
Cheesy Seasoning Blend [sku 71295] for even more flavor. And, like any good Fry, they're especially amenable 
to dipping in ketchups, barbecue sauces, or special spreads like our Magnifisauce [sku 69916].

"072120","Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal Bites","To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand,
And Eternity in an hour....

- William Blake, ""The Auguries of Innocence""

To Mr. Blake, we counter: why hold infinity in the palm of your hand when you can hold oatmeal in the palm of your 
hand? Yes, you read that correctly. Oatmeal. In your hand. No mess involved - all thanks to Trader Joe's Apple 
Cinnamon Oatmeal Bites. For this most modern of breakfast creations, we start with steel cut oats and soak them 
for several hours in a cozy mixture of milk, butter, cinnamon, sugar, and real dried apples - Granny Smith, Gala, Fuji, 
Golden Delicious, and Pink Lady apples, to name names. Next, we roll this oatmeal into two-or-three-bite-sized balls 
and lightly coat each one with breadcrumbs. Finally, we flash-fry and flash-freeze the lot of them and send them to our 
stores, where they'll be waiting for you to take them home and toss them into your air fryer. (You can also use your oven 
or microwave - but an air fryer will win the day!)

When it comes to breakfast, forget the Auguries of Innocence. At Trader Joe's, we're all about the Auguries of Deliciousness. 
Once you take that first Bite, you will be, too. Serve Trader Joe's Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal Bites warm, alongside a 
cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice as a super-simple way to break the fast on-the-go. Or, if you're up for it, get a little 
adventurous by dunking them in Greek yogurt, topping them with dollops of peanut butter, or even serving them for 
dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of TJ's Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce. (One word: WOW.)

"068713","French Onion Macaroni & Cheese","Take a look at our freezers, and one thing becomes abundantly clear: we've developed quite the knack for 
frozen mac. We've taken the cozy, comfort food qualities of macaroni and cheese to exciting new places, but 
our newest combination may be our most ambitious yet. Inspired by yet another comfort food icon, Trader 
Joe's French Onion Macaroni & Cheese combines the creamy goodness of mac and cheese with the savory, 
flavorful, and texturally stupendous elements of a fresh-from-the-oven French onion soup - complete with a 
layer of crispy croutons on top.

Made with a saucy mix of Swiss and Cheddar cheeses, and perfectly roasted, luxuriously caramelized onions, 
this French Onion Macaroni & Cheese represents a magnificent medley of flavors, aromas, and textures. From 
the slight tanginess of the Swiss, to the rich, onion-y aromatics, all the way to the textural contrast between the 
elbow macaroni and crunchy croutons, every element is rich and satisfying. What could be better on a gloomy 
day or quiet night than this captivating comfort food mashup? How about a phenomenal retail? For a limited

"070784","Eggwich Breadless Breakfast Sandwich","Popularized by fast food joints and coffee shops worldwide, the breakfast sandwich is a marvel of simple, 
scrumptious engineering: just bread, meat, cheese, and egg, in one compact, elegantly easy-to-eat package. 
Of course, even the best designs can do with a bit of streamlining now and then. That's where Trader Joe's 
Eggwich Sandwich comes in. This ingenious twist on a classic formula starts with an old-fashioned base 
of turkey sausage topped with American cheese, but replaces the bread with two soft-yet-sturdy scrambled 
egg patties, creating a breakfast sandwich experience that's packed with protein, lighter on carbs, and has 
everything you need to start your day off on a decidedly delicious note.

Each Eggwich comes fully cooked and ready to reheat from frozen, which only takes about two minutes in the 
microwave. Once heated through (and given a moment to cool), the cheese becomes marvelously melty, the 
turkey sausage takes on a crisp, yet yielding, texture, and the egg patties become fantastically fluffy, while still 
maintaining enough structure to act as handholds. If that weren't enough, every Eggwich is consciously crafted 
to contain a whopping sixteen grams of protein, but only three grams of carbohydrates. Now that's a golden 
ratio, if we've ever heard of one.

"053276","Quinoa Cowboy Veggie Burgers","With a little bit of Andean ingenuity and a smidge of creative license borrowed from the American west, we've 
come up with an original-and delicious!-take on the near-ubiquitous ""veggie burger."" In the interest of full 
disclosure, we're compelled to reveal that the true inspiration for Trader Joe's Quinoa Cowboy Veggie Burg-
ers sprung from two of our favorite products: Organic Tri Color Quinoa [sku 96689], and Cowboy Caviar Salsa 
[sku 50784]. These burgers are, more or less, a blend of the two.  

With multi-hued quinoa (red, white, and black) setting the stage, black beans, corn, red peppers, and plenty 
of seasonings are blended together and formed into a burger patty. They cook up to a captivatingly chewy 
consistency, with just the right amount of crunch on the outside (not so crunchy if you cook them in the mi-
crowave). They work on a bun, like any other burger-ratchet up their Southwestern vibe with the addition of 
sliced avocado and salsa instead of the usual pickles and ketchup. Break them up into salads-a simple dress-
ing of salsa verde will do the trick here. Or just serve with a knife and fork and your favorite fixin's.

We're selling Quinoa Cowboy Veggie Burgers in a 12-ounce package of four burgers for $3.69, every day.  
You'll find them in our freezers.

texture, and delectable dunkability of a classic chicken nugget - and, of course, none of the actual chicken. 
Once cooked, their seasoned breading exterior gets delightfully brown and crisp, their soy and potato protein-

evokes the experience of eating a standard chicken nugget that it feels...well, impossible!

All it takes is just a few moments in the oven, microwave, or air fryer, and these Impossible¿ Chicken Nuggets 
are ready to serve as a side, starter, or snack. Each serving provides 13 grams of plant-based protein, and pairs

"074961","BBQ Teriyaki Chicken","We mentioned Trader Joe's BBQ Chicken Teriyaki includes a ""shiny"", savory sauce, so we're sure you're 
wondering why someone would describe this tender chicken entrée and umami BBQ glaze as ""shiny"". Well, 
the word ""teriyaki"" is actually a derivative of the Japanese words teri, meaning the shine or luster given by the 
sauce, and yaki, which refers to the process of grilling or broiling of the chicken (or whatever you're ""shining"" 
up with the glaze). Like teri and yaki, we believe this succulent chicken and sweet sauce should stop at nothing 
short of being joined together to form teriyaki.

Much like the classic Japanese preparations of this dish, we like to keep the whole thing simple. Establishing the 
foundation for this classic dish is our dark skinless chicken leg meat - think juicy, rich, almost gamey in texture. 
And topping it off is our traditional sugar, soy, and sake-based sauce that would be used just fine to drench only 
the included chicken, but consider allowing it to soak through a carefully made bed of rice dressed with those 
same tender chicken strips. We're selling each 21-ounce package of Trader Joe's BBQ Chicken Teriyaki 
every day for $4.99* so you, too, can have this illustrious meal from freezer to fork in under ten minutes!

appeal, edginess and delightful bite. Crafted for us by a prominent French bakery that has mastered the 
macaronage technique, each macaron promises two perfectly pillowy cookie-pastries, with smooth, crispy 
exteriors and moist interiors, that sandwich vibrant fillings, ranging from jam to buttercream.  

With two Macarons of each flavor in a box, the assortment presents beautifully, resembling the appearance 
of a Macarons display in a Paris pâtisserie or a local, upscale bake shop. Unlike the Macarons you'd find 
in either of those two places, however, Trader Joe's Macarons contain no synthetic coloring or artificial 
flavoring, and they're about three times less expensive. No kidding. We're selling a 4.2 ounce box of our

"070609","Southwest Style Chicken Quesadillas","When we found out that the Mexican supplier of our Southwest Style Chicken Quesadillas [sku 87002] could 
no longer make them for us, we were a little disappointed. After all, it was a good product! Still, we always try 
to live by that optimistic credo ""If life gives you lemons..."" In this case, there were no lemons; and in fact, you 
might say our Quesadillas were taken away. There was nothing left to do, then, but make more-and to make 
them even better than before!

We found a great supplier in Los Angeles who begins with a flour tortilla filled with queso-specifically, 
Monterey Jack and Pepper Jack. Chunks of white-meat chicken (seasoned with onion, garlic, and sea salt) 
combine forces with the gooey cheese to create a savory flavor sensation, which also delivers 23g of protein per 
single Quesadilla.

More tasty and textural interest is added by black beans and a variety of veggies, including corn, spinach, red 
bell peppers, and jalapeno peppers. Finally, a handful of seasonings (cilantro, paprika, cumin...), along with a 
quick grilling, give our new Southwest Style Chicken Quesadillas the final touch. Correction: the real final 
touch is yours, when heat it from frozen in the microwave, skillet, or conventional oven!

time of year.  It's versatile, delicious, and in the case of Trader Joe's New York Style Cheesecake, it couldn't be 
simpler - just thaw and serve. New York-style cheesecakes use a cream cheese base, also incorporating sour 
cream and a graham cracker crust. As a bonus, sour cream makes the cheesecake more resilient to completely 
freezing, that's why we can just thaw ours in 1-2 hours at room temperature. Its creamy, smooth consistency 
and rich traditional cheesecake flavor make it a winner no matter how you slice it - we recommend using a 
cake slicer, but, hey, whatever works for you. 

Serve it just as it is or pair it with warm strawberries, blueberries, and a dollop of whipped cream for an extra-
special dessert treat. Each 30-ounce NY Deli Style Cheesecake is $6.99*. You'll find it in our freezers.

"069330","Vegan Mint & Chip Bon Bons","When it comes to ice cream flavor combos, mint and chocolate go together like chestnuts and an open fire. The 
only issue is, being a classic ice cream flavor (emphasis on the cream), it's not always accessible to those who 
don't eat dairy. We wanted to pay tribute to this dynamic duo of the dessert world, while making sure that our 
dairy free customers would have a chance to try it, so we put a supplier who specializes in coconut-based desserts 
to the task. They came back with Trader Joe's Non Dairy Mint & Chip Bon Bons. We ardently approved.

Chocolatey, minty, and creamy, while still remaining distinctly dairy-free, each one-or-two-bite-sized Bon 
Bon is made from a base of frozen coconut milk that's flavored with refreshing mint, studded with crunchy 
chocolate chips, then enrobed in an outer layer of chocolate. They're the perfect size for grabbing and eating 
one at a time, making them a great option to pull out of the freezer as an anytime treat. And at $4.29 for a 
5.64 ounce box, they're a remarkable value, too. During the holiday season, you can find Trader Joe's Non

occurred to you to store your vegetables in a pouch? It occurred to us, and that's why you'll find Trader Joe's 
Crispy Vegetable Pouches in our freezers this holiday season. 

Crispy Vegetable Pouches are adorable, handmade pockets of pastry dough filled with vegetables and savory 
seasonings, gathered and ""tied"" at the top with a string made of more pastry dough, so they resemble little 
golden bundles. Bundles of gastronomic joy, really. Inside each wonton-like Pouch is a blend of vegetables 
including jicama, taro, cabbage, carrots, onions, and shiitake mushrooms. The veggies are accented with garlic, 
soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and red chili. Each Pouch is just a bit bigger than bite-sized, and the gathered 
top acts as a handle of-sorts, making these ideal appetizers for a cocktail party where guests are standing, and 
balancing plates is not always an option. While they are excellent hors d'oeuvres, you might also consider them 
for a light dinner. Serve alongside a quick slaw accented with Carrot Miso Ginger Dressing [sku 61174], and you 
have a super (and super cute) supper in just a few minutes.

some extra-special olives this time of year. One of our new favorites, however, won't be found on our shelves. 
Trader Joe's Fried Olive Bites are available only in our freezers! 

Two olive varieties renowned for their flavor-green Castelvetrano olives from Italy and dark purple Kalamatas 
from Greece-are both pitted and finely chopped, then mixed and bound together, creating a kind of olive 
""dough,"" if you will. Through the miracle of modern machinery, a velvety mixture of mascarpone, Roquefort, 
and cream cheeses is enveloped by this olive mix. Finally, these 'cheese-stuffed olives' are lightly battered, rolled 
in panko breadcrumbs, and fried to a crispness that retains its texture when you reheat these Bites for about 
10 minutes in your own 400°F oven. Served when still warm, you'll experience that crisp exterior, followed by 
the taste of tender, meaty olives, followed by smooth, creamy cheese... followed by true (albeit momentary), 
food-induced bliss. 

They're only available for the holiday season, but through the miracle of modern technology, you can store 
several boxes in your freezer for a later date. Score!

variety of sweet desserts and savory hors d'oeuvres in a fraction of the time it would take if you had to make the 
pastry from scratch. 

Our domestic supplier crafts this Puff Pastry by layering pure butter with an unbleached wheat flour dough, 
folding and turning and folding again (and again, and again, and again¿) to create literally dozens of layers of 
butter and dough in each sheet. Finished sheets are then folded once and frozen, making it a cinch for you to 
defrost, cut and bake them as needed once you get them home.

We're selling each 18-ounce box of two All Butter Puff Pastry sheets for $3.99. Find it in our freezer case, 
ready for your pastry creations.

"057182","All Butter Puff Pastry Sheets","Even without chocolate inside, a croissant is one of the most decadent pastries one can enjoy. It's crisp, flaky, 
doughy, and buttery-all at the same time. It may be easy to eat, but making the special dough (aka Pâte Feuille-
tée) that's behind such decadence is notoriously time-consuming, and involves a fair amount of pastry prowess. 
Now, with Trader Joe's All Butter Puff Pastry, the hardest part of the baking process will be deciding which of 
the many pastry possibilities you'll be creating with this ready-made dough.

Pâte Feuilletée literally means ""leaf-like pastry,"" referring to the hundreds of thin, alternating layers (729 layers, 
to be exact!) of butter and flour that activate its ""puffing"" in the oven. As the butter heats up, it steams, lifting 
and separating the layers around it. This happens between every layer, resulting in an almost impossibly delicate 
and crisp outside, with an interior that is airy and soft. Since butter is the key, we sought out a French supplier 
who not only has the ""prowess,"" but who also uses butter in their Pâte Feuilletée, instead of the shortenings you 
commonly find in other store-bought puff pastry dough.

What will you make with it? There are at least as many options as there are thin layers of this folded dough. Make 
croissants, cinnamon rolls, Palmiers, biscuits, popovers, hand-pies, strudels, flatbreads, pizzas, potpies, Beef 
Wellington, Brie en croute, Napoleons, churros¿

Each 18.3 ounce box contains two individually rolled sheets of dough, each one sealed in its own pouch and 
ready to defrost as needed. That's two, French-made, artisan-quality, All Butter Puff Pastry sheets for $3.99.

"071873","12 Cranberry Orange Bars","Using our ever-popular 12 Classic Lemon Bars [sku 69630] as a source of inspiration, you can think of our 12 
Cranberry Orange Bars as a variation on that sweet treat's theme - especially if you consider the theme to be 
""effortlessly delicious desserts."" Just like their Lemon-y counterparts, these Bars start with a base of delightfully 
buttery shortbread, which is topped with a sweet, creamy, silky-textured curd. This time, however, our supplier 
employs a wonderfully wintry combination of tart cranberry purée and sweetened orange peel to create a 
sensationally seasonal treat that's perfect for holiday potlucks, post-feast desserts, or even idly eating with a 
cup of hot tea.

Preparation couldn't be simpler: just leave these to thaw at room temperature for one hour, or in the fridge for 
at least four hours, then serve. Their eye-catching, muted ruby color and clean-cut appearance make them a 
real gem when presented at the holiday table, and they pair splendidly with a dollop of fresh whipped cream or 
scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576]. And since each box comes pre-portioned and ready to serve,

pleasantly tart alternative to traditionally super-sweet holiday offerings, and you won't want to argue about 
whether it should be called pie, cake or cobbler - you'll just want more.

How does one enjoy this ambrosial treat? To defrost, simply remove the pie from the wrapper and place it in a 
325-degree oven for 20 minutes. Or if your oven is full of turkey and stuffing, set the pie out on the counter at 
room temperature for 1-2 hours. Once defrosted, invert the pie onto your desired serving dish and remove the

In short, we've taken that famous Green Bean Casserole, and re-imagined it in appetizer form! One of our 
trusted app suppliers forms bite-sized cups from fillo dough, then fills them with that familiar mixture of green 
beans, mushrooms, heavy cream, and Cheddar cheese. They sprinkle crispy fried onions on top-a finishing 
touch that most people would consider the distinctive mark of this holiday classic.

After 7 to 12 minutes in a 400°F conventional oven, the cups are flaky and crisp, ideal for delivering all the 
creamy deliciousness of the Casserole filling. (Pro tip: 7 minutes in your air fryer makes for an even crispier 
exterior.) Serve them up on an appetizer platter before dinner and you'll not only save space at the main table,

the same conclusion: every meal, even a meal as big as Thanksgiving dinner, can be improved by adding cheesy 
potatoes. That's why we're such big fans of frozen side dishes like our new Scallopini Potatoes. They're made 
for us by an Italian supplier, who slices the potatoes nice and thin, and then covers them, layer by layer, in a 
super creamy sauce made with a blend of four Italian cheeses. The result is everything you could ask for in a 
side dish: moist, easy-textured potatoes, rich, savory cream sauce, and gooey, delicious cheese.

They're also super easy to prepare: just 45 to 50 minutes at 350º in the oven (or 11 minutes in the microwave)
are all that separates you and an officially cheesy-potato-fied meal. Whether you need an extra side for the 
holiday table, family feast, or even just a quick weekend dinner, Trader Joe's Scallopini Potatoes are the logical

have a Facebook page or Twitter account) you may have noticed that they've gone from fridge to freezer over 
time. Customer feedback told us this made more sense, and your feedback also made us realize we had them 
packaged pretty poorly. We think we've finally gotten them right. It's the same great recipe it's always been, 
using real butter that you can taste. Only now, rather than being folded and ultimately prone to cracking and 
breakage, we've rolled the dough, so the crusts are easy to roll out into your pie plate. It works like a charm. And 
it couldn't be easier.

Just take a crust out of the box, let it thaw, roll it out into a pie plate, fill and bake. It's larger than the average 
supermarket pie crust-you can either make a bigger pie or trim and use the excess for decorating-a quickly 
cut ""leaf "" or ""apple"" looks pretty darn impressive atop your pie. The crust is flaky, crispy, and light, and it bakes 
to perfection every time. (Our little secret: for perfectly browned crust, brush with milk or a whisked egg just 
before baking.) Each 22-ounce box of Trader Joe's Pie Crusts (2 Crusts) is $3.99*, every day. You'll find it in

with garlic and onion, to add depth; and finished with a Parmesan-rich béchamel. Rich, creamy, hearty, and 
delicious. And best of all, it's fully cooked before being frozen, so it's ready to heat and eat in minutes (five in the

"068394","Pumpkin Empanadas","What would you imagine that Trader Joe's Crew Members do when they get together? Talk about food and swap 
recipes? YES! And so it came to pass that a Crew Member told one of our Buyers about a family recipe for pumpkin 
empanadas. Given our tendency to love all things pumpkin, we were enthralled. When we found a supplier who could 
recreate a version of this unique take on classic South American ""hand pies,"" we were hooked!

Trader Joe's Pumpkin Empanadas are simultaneously simple and entirely unexpected. We expect savory and maybe 
even a bit spicy in an empanada - we just never expected dessert. In fact, the flaky pastry exterior is the most traditonal 
component of this iteration. Inside is a slightly sweet pumpkin filling, subtly spiced with the likes of clove, cinnamon, 
ginger, and allspice, and balanced by creamy coconut milk (they don't taste like coconut). It's like a pumpkin pie you can

"068408","Mini Spicy Pumpkin Samosas","Aren't samosas traditionally savory, loaded with vegetables and Indian spices? Why yes, yes they are. But 
here¿ oh, here we've developed something similar, yet entirely different. Each triangular Mini Spicy Pumpkin 
Samosa looks like a typical Indian savory, with the expected golden, flaky pastry exterior. Inside, though, is 
where the twist is revealed: myriad spices - including garam masala, cumin, coriander, chile powder, and 
fennel seeds - partner with paneer cheese and chunks of pumpkin to create an only-at-Trader Joe's, Indian-
inspired appetizer that brings warmth and comfort to the season.

You can serve them with a traditional Indian-inspired meal - a trek through our freezer case can get you there 
in an instant. Try them with a dollop of our Hot & Sweet Pepper Jelly [96534]. Or you can remove all pretense of 
tradition and serve them with an assortment of pumpkin-flavored finger-foods including Pumpkin Empanadas 
[68394] or a slice of Pumpkin Bread (Mix) [52484] . However you serve them, they'll serve to make you smile. 
And isn't that just the best thing? We're selling Mini Spicy Pumpkin Samosas in an 8.5 ounce box, while they

"070642","Maple Poffertjes","A long-favored fixture of winter festivals in the Netherlands, poffertjes are light, puffy, miniature pancakes that 
are traditionally served with a bit of butter and powdered sugar. They're typically made from a simple recipe 
of sweet, yeasted batter, but require a highly specialized skillet called a poffertjespan to attain their perfectly 
snackable, one-or-two-bite size. In the spirit of foodie festivity, and in recognition of the fact that most of us 
don't have a spare poffertjespan lying around, we proudly offer Trader Joe's Maple Flavored Poffertjes as an 
effortless option for breakfasts, brunches, or even just sweet, simply snacking.

Light, puffy, and perfectly sized to pop in your mouth, our frozen Poffertjes are flavored with rich maple sugar 
to give each bite the feeling of a pancake covered in maple syrup, and take less than a minute to heat a serving 
in the microwave. Like the traditional Dutch treat they were inspired by, they can be topped with melted butter 
and a sprinkling of powdered sugar, or accompanied by your favorite fruit preserves (or even a quick drizzle of 
more maple syrup) to match your mood. Portionable enough to be enjoyed as a quick snack, sweet enough to 
be enjoyed as a dessert, we particularly enjoy our Maple Flavored Poffertjes when served as a side for bigger 
breakfast situations.

"071063","Japchae Korean Glass Noodles & Vegetable Stir Fry","Japchae is a delicious Korean dish that historically has been favored for special occasions and large gatherings 
because of its yummy simplicity-and the fact that it can be prepared ahead of time in large quantities. Trader 
Joe's Japchae puts this traditional dish in your hands, so you can easily enjoy it any day of the week!

The word Jap-chae literally means ""mixed vegetable,"" and this tells you one important part of what you need to 
know: it's a stir-fry that includes onion, spinach, carrot, and bell peppers. The other half of what you need to 
know is that these veggies are partnered with glass noodles made from sweet potato and lightly seasoned with 
soy sauce. True to their name, these noodles are semi-translucent, with a soft, pleasantly chewy texture.

Both the veggies and noodles were cooked in a delicious sauce that involves sesame oil and a bit of brown sugar 
for a flavor combo that will satisfy your savory-sweet craving. And you won't have to wait long to be satisfied... 
just 3 to 5 minutes to heat the package from frozen on the stovetop or in the microwave!

These Bites are exactly what they sound like they'd be: two-or-three-bite-sized balls of a warm, comforting 
combination of roasted butternut squash (the main ingredient), macaroni (known in some circles as ""elbow

smooth cream cheese, impressive amounts of actual pumpkin (it's no longer round by the time it's blended 
here), and seasonal, pumpkin pie spices. It makes a quick and easy dessert for a special-occasion gathering 
(why not dress it up with spooky accoutrements for Halloween?), a weekend dinner party, or a weeknight 
supper with the family. Carve it up - you're probably best sticking with slices, as jack o'lantern-style carving 
would leave some cheesecake lovers with significantly less to love than others - and top the slices with freshly 
whipped cream, ice cream, crème anglaise, caramel sauce, or nothing at all - the flavor of the Cheesecake is 
rewarding enough.

we use just the right amount of butterfat to ensure that every spoonful tastes rich and delicious). ¿ is particular

"069665","Sweet Cinnamon Filled Korean Pancakes","When strolling through the streets of Seoul on a still, chilly morning, among the many sights to see, you 
may encounter the scent of fresh hotteok being served straight from the grills and fry pans of street vendors. 
Nowadays, these flaky, flavorful pancakes come in all kinds of varieties, stuffed with all manner of sweet or 
savory ingredients. But it's the original, classically sweet and aromatic, cinnamon-filled version that remains the 
most popular. That's precisely why we chose them as the inspiration for Trader Joe's Sweet Cinnamon Filled 
Korean Pancakes, a delicious way to bring the sweet sensations of a Seoul street scene to your very own kitchen. 

Each box contains four Pancakes, which can be quickly and easily prepared in the microwave, on the stovetop, 
or in the air fryer. Once cooked, each Pancake develops a marvelously toasty brown exterior and pleasantly 
gooey cinnamon-sugar interior, which plays exceptionally well off the dough's mochi-like chewiness. They 
make an excellent anytime dessert option, and an especially indulgent breakfast treat. We like them best when 
they're fresh and hot, sliced in half laterally, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in between.

veggies are up to the task of tot-ness, they also show how effective they can be when working together. They're 
made from a multitudinous mix of organic vegetables, including carrots, onions, kale, sweet potatoes, broccoli, 
celery, and tomatoes, along with a bit of organic brown rice flour and dotted with crunchy sunflower seeds 
to provide just a bit of textural contrast. They're also just slightly larger than your standard tot, coming in at 
around one or two bites per Bite - in other words, the perfect size for dunking in your favorite dipping sauce.

After just a few minutes in either the air fryer, frying pan, or conventional oven, these vegan Bites develop a 
gloriously golden-brown exterior and crisp texture that goes especially well with ketchups, barbecue sauces, 
or even more adventurous choices like our Zhoug Sauce [sku 59192] or Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto [sku

"090987","Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches","Nothing subliminal about it; these ice cream sandwiches more than live up to their name. Trader Joe's Sublime 
Ice Cream Sandwiches came to fruition some years back, when we had an ice cream epiphany and realized we 
could do better-way better-than most of the ice cream sandwiches we found in freezers around the country. 
Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. 
(Yes, it's a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper 
crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they'd been frozen), we moved on to 
the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie 
and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet 
chocolate chips. In case you were curious, this is the kind of task we can always be counted on to undertake 
with vigilance.

Not only do these Ice Cream Sandwiches taste Sublime, they're sublimely priced at $4.49 for a package of four 
(20 ounces). A little hint to maximize enjoyment¿ remove them from the freezer a few minutes before you eat 
them-this will ensure the texture is just perfect!

"066563","Mandarin Orange Chicken","Way back in 2004, we introduced Mandarin Orange Chicken to our freezers. In fact, we were so enthusiastic 
about its introduction that we printed it in a Fearless Flyer before it was technically ready for prime time. Yeah. 
We did that. And on the front page. But the bags weren't printed, you see, so there was no way to get it into the 
store in time to meet expectations. But then, where there is a will, there is a way. It wasn't pretty (literally or 
figuratively), but we got it done-clear plastic bags with labels until the real packaging was printed. Even in an 
ugly package, this product hit the big time the minute it arrived, and hasn't slowed a bit since. 

The secret to Trader Joe's Mandarin Orange Chicken's success is in its simplicity, really.  Tender chunks of 
juicy chicken in a crispy breading with a sweet and spicy orange sauce¿ what's not to love? And here's our 
favorite way to prepare it: bake the chicken in a 400º oven; when the chicken is cooked through, add the sauce 
to a skillet or wok; once the sauce is hot, add the chicken and toss together until the sauce adheres to the chicken 
and caramelizes a bit. You can also microwave the sauce and toss it with the chicken, but we think the little bit 
of extra effort pays off handsomely. Serve with rice and veggies for a complete meal that doesn't take much time 
to prepare, and delivers big flavors at a small price.

We're selling each 22-ounce package of Mandarin Orange Chicken for $4.99, every day. You'll find it in our

Gouda, and Swiss. Smoothed with milk and butter, the cheeses melt to blanket the elbows beautifully - though, 
a quick stir can seriously spread the gooey-d-ness.  Whether you heat in the microwave (about 5 minutes) or

sweet, creamy center. As the kids say, it's all good. It really is. Each piece is a mere 80 calories, though we've

then there are the other six nights every week when you really just need to get dinner on the table in a hurry.  
On those occasions, Trader Joe's Turkey Burgers have the potential to become your best friends. 

Trader Joe's Turkey Burgers are made using fresh, juicy turkey meat, with no by-products, mechanically sep-
arated meat, or trimmings. The combination of white and dark meat ensures juicy, flavorful burgers - we've 
added only kosher salt and rosemary extract to season the patties. You can cook them - from frozen, even! 
- in just a few minutes; while they're cooking, go ahead and prep the rest of your dinner. Go traditional with 
buns, condiments, and salad. Or you can crumble the finished burgers over salad or in tacos. It doesn't get 
much easier than this, and you don't have to sacrifice quality or taste for the sake of convenience and value.  

Speaking of value, we're selling each 16 ounce package of four Turkey Burgers for $2.99, the same price we've

"069630","Lemon Bars","It's always hard to say good bye to an iconic item, and our original Lemon Bars [sku 93415] certainly fit that 
bill. But when our original supplier informed us they could no longer produce those Bars, we took it as an 
opportunity for a real kaizen. We reached out to another of our trusted suppliers and asked if they could make 
us a version that had all the same zesty, sweet, and tart flavors, the same soft, buttery-textured shortbread and 
silky, smooth lemon layer - but none of the gelatin that left the last version inaccessible to vegetarians. They 
came back with a tray of lemon bars so superbly true to form that we knew they were going to be an instant 
classic. Fittingly enough, we decided to call them Trader Joe's 12 Classic Lemon Bars.

Our favorite thing about these Bars is their bite. The delicate texture of the soft, creamy lemon layer instantly 
gives way to the dense, deliciously crumbly shortbread base, giving you all the satisfaction of a sweet custard 
and a rich, buttery biscuit all at the same time. Of course, we also love that they're super easy to prepare; 
simply defrost them at room temperature for about an hour before serving. And we can't forget that they're a 
remarkable value, too: each 10.6-ounce box sells for $4.49*, every day. There's so many things to love about our 
new, vegetarian, kosher (dairy) Classic Lemon Bars, we really could go on, but that might be time better spent

"059063","Mexican Style Roasted Corn","In much of Mexico, as well as many parts of the American Southwest, street vendors sell well-seasoned corn on 
the cob that's known as elote. It's almost always on the cob, and nearly always on a stick. The seasonings vary, 
but generally include chili powder, cheese, lime or lemon, and a sour cream (crema) based sauce. If you haven't 
encountered these street vendors in your travels, you've been missing out on something delicious. And even 
if you have had the opportunity to enjoy elote in its natural environment, you're not always going to be near a 
street vendor, right? To satisfy your elote desires at those times, we've developed Trader Joe's Mexican Style 
Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese. 

For this at-home version of what's often called street corn, we've opted to take the kernels off the cob. We've 
enrobed the corn in a creamy, smoky sauce that melts off as the corn heats - it seems magical, but it's really 
just simple thermodynamics. It's also spiked with lime juice and studded with cilantro, lending additional 
authenticity. A packet of Cotija cheese is included in each package of Corn - when the corn is heated through 
and ready to serve, sprinkle the crumbled cheese on top. It's the ideal finishing touch to this crunchy, sweet, 
smoky, spicy dish. Present it as a side dish with a Mexican-inspired meal, or serve it in individual ramekins as 
an appetizer course.

We're selling Mexican Style Roasted Corn with Cotija Cheese in a 14-ounce bag for $3.29. You'll find it 
exclusively in the freezer case at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"039127","Meatless Meatballs","Who says that a backyard barbecue or rich Italian dinner can only be had with a helping of pork, beef, and 
chicken, oh my? Well, Trader Joes Meatless Meatballs are here to keep the party going for all dietary needs 
and desires.

The ultimate oxymoron, Meatless Meatballs, but great for our shoppers who don't want a carnivorous entrée 
with every meal. We nix the beef and bring on the soy protein loaded with seasonings to replicate the hearty 
balls of ground meat that we also know and love. Every bite is soft, toothsome, and packed with bread crumbs, 
garlic, onion, and an array of other spices just like the real deal. 

Trader Joe's Meatless Meatballs take flawlessly to any recipe where that meaty texture and flavor is needed, 
but without the need for any doggone red meat at all! So grab a bag of these guys from our freezer and in no 
time you'll have vegetarian BBQ meatball subs (maybe using our Organic Kansas City BBQ Sauce [sku 63486]); 
lovely vegan skewers with some sauce, a few onions, peppers, and maybe even some pineapple; or a luscious, 
yet quick-to-prep Italian meal with our Cauliflower Gnocchi [sku 61524] and your favorite pasta sauce.

while on the phone, or on the moon. With apologies to the good doctor (Seuss, that is), we're having difficulty 
thinking of any scenario in which we wouldn't want to enjoy Trader Joe's Organic Vanilla Fudge Chip Ice 
Cream. Sounds good, right? It really is that good. 

TJ's Organic Vanilla Fudge Chip Ice Cream comes from an ice cream supplier that does everything from pas-
teurizing the fresh, locally sourced organic milk and cream to packaging and shipping the finished ice cream. 
They know their ice cream. One bite and you'll want to know this ice cream. 

This is premium quality Organic Vanilla Ice Cream studded with rich, fudgy chunks of chocolate. Could we 
have called it Chocolate Chip? Sure. Somehow, though, when we tasted it (and tasted it again, just to be sure), 
that didn't seem to be enough. This is ice cream with gravitas-it needed a name to match. 

You'll find Organic Vanilla Fudge Chip Ice Cream in our freezers, ready for your enjoyment in a cup, on a 
cone, with a spoon, on the phone, or even on the moon. Or Jupiter! We're selling quart-sized cartons for $5.99

"064671","Cedar Wrapped BBQ Sockeye Salmon Fillet","Ever since the Native Americans of the Pacific Coast tied their salmon to cedar boards and smoked them near 
an open fire, Trader Joe's has been looking for a cedar planked salmon of our own to sell. (That's hyperbole, ok?) 
From the start, we at least knew we wanted to use Sockeye Salmon, since this variety ranks consistently among 
our Customers' favorite frozen items. However, all the sockeye/cedar-plank combos we came across were cost 
prohibitive and really wouldn't translate into a Trader Joe's value.

Still, we didn't give up. We finally located a supplier that exchanges the wooden plank for a thin wrap of 
cedar, hand-tied around a six-ounce deboned fillet of wild caught, Alaskan sockeye. Our Cedar Wrapped 
Sockeye Salmon is also rubbed with BBQ seasonings, including smoked sea salt and chipotle powder to yield 
a balanced, smoky, mildly spicy, distinctly cedar-y Fillet. And, in addition to imparting flavor, that cedar wrap 
also ensures a super moist result-no matter whether you bake it or grill it!

"062839","Mini French Baguettes","It's often said that the best baguettes in the world are made in France. There are a few theories as two why: some 
argue that it's a tendency for higher gluten content, some point to a mastery of fermentation techniques, others 
tie it to various intangible qualities of local ingredients. Whatever the cause, it's all academic unless you have 
the chance to visit France. But that got us thinking: why not bring France to our freezers? Thus, we bring to you 
Trader Joe's Mini French Baguettes, a collection of six compact, individual baguettes, made especially for us 
by a French bakery, which are baked to about 80% doneness, then frozen for you to finish at home. And that 
means one thing in particular: ineffably French, perfectly baked Baguettes, fresh from your very own oven.

Once fully cooked from your oven (simply place them directly on the oven rack, from frozen, at 400°F for 
about six minutes), these Baguettes can be enjoyed in any way you would if they came from a boulangerie 
on the banks of the Seine: cut them into hunks and enjoy with a bowl of soup, tear into pieces and dip into a 
flavorful olive oil, even split them horizontally for an elegantly elevated sandwich. We're selling each 9.5-ounce 
package of six Mini French Baguettes for $3.99*, every day - which is considerably less expensive than 
airfare to Paris, last time we checked.

delicious, and Trader Joe's Tandoori Naan boasts manifold merits. We bring you this frozen rendition for 
when you want the taste of India sans leaving the house to get it.

Our hearty Tandoori Naan is hand-stretched and baked in a traditional Indian clay tandoor oven. It gets its 
satisfyingly dense doughy-ness from wheat flour. Its soft-yet-sturdy texture and distinct circular shape lend to 
multiple methods of enjoyment. Our Tandoori Naan is great served up warm with butter and is the perfect 
pair for your favorite Indian-style curries and sauces. It also makes a great match to your favorite hearty soups 
as well!  Did we mention that our versatile Tandoori Naan can also be a great substitute to your everyday wheat 
bread and can turn an ordinary sandwich into extraordinary just by layering on your favorite meats, cheese, 
or vegetables!

"055248","Greek Spanakopita","Trader Joe's has been exploring the food-riches of the Greek Isles for a while now, but only in the last year have 
we really begun to sink our teeth into their wealth of savory pies. Following in the recent footsteps of our 5 
Cheese Greek Spiral [sku 54073], and our Tomato Tiropita Triangles [sku 54481], our latest pita is a traditional 
""pie"" you may have heard of, even if you've never traveled to Greece. But, we did travel to Greece for this Spana-
kopita, where we engaged some Athenian bakers to make this authentic Greek pastry for us (and for you).

It's essentially a spinach pie... but the genius is in the details. Our Greek pie-makers start with their own filo 
dough, machine-cut to size and hand assembled into pies with a filling of three cheeses (feta, mizithra, and a 
grating cheese), spinach, onion, leek, olive oil, dill, parsley, salt and pepper. The loaded disc is then pre-cut into 
wedges that will puff up when you bake them at home. Once you do bake this pie (in the provided ovenable tray 
at 350ºF for about a half-hour), you'll have yourself a crisp, buttery pastry with a delectable filling.

Our Spanakopita makes a great snack anytime, and it can also serve as a light meal when paired with a fresh sal-
ad of tomatoes, olives, and greens, and lightly dressed with 100% Greek Olive Oil and Lemon Juice [sku 54483]).

We would still recommend you visit Greece, but if it's going to be a while, we would also suggest you visit Trader 
Joe's (much nearer) for a taste of our Greek Spanakopita to get you in the mood. The authentic, 14-ounce, fro-
zen snack is only $3.99. Find it in our freezers.

Some might be surprised by the idea of a Yam Flavored Ice Cream, but those familiar with Ube [OO-beh]-the 
name Purple Yams are known by in the Philippines-know that it's actually a very popular flavor in jams, cakes, 
candies...and Ice Cream! But what does it taste like, you ask? It's creamy. It's sweet. It's nutty. Some liken it to a 
cross between vanilla and pistachio, with hints of coconut mixed in. And unlike most ube-flavored ice creams, 
ours contains real ube purée. Trust us, you're gonna like it. Plus, you can rest easy knowing that its purple hue is 
from naturally derived ingredients like grape extract and beet juice, not artificial dyes. 

You know what else is naturally derived? The pure joy you'll experience as you sample your first scoop (or polish 
off your first pint) of Ube Ice Cream. Serve it in a bowl, flanked by TJ's Vanilla Batons [sku 63485] and sprinkled

(and for the '80s in general)
While ice cream is a year-round offering at Trader Joe's, summer's sweltering temperatures make it an even 
more in-demand dessert option in our freezers. Trader Joe's Southern Peach Crisp Ice Cream combines the 
aforementioned cool factor of ice cream with the fleeting nature of Southern summer stone fruit, creating a 
truly one-of-a-kind dessert experience. In addition to the dreamy, sweet cream ice cream base, our Georgia-

"059064","Peaches & Cream Tarte","Some folks seem to get a kick out of reminding the rest of us that ""life can't always be peaches & cream"" when 
things don't go our way. While we can appreciate a healthy dose of realism here and there, we'd like to challenge 
these Negative Nancies: why can't life always be peaches & cream, hmm? As long as you have a stack of Trader 
Joe's Peaches & Cream Tartes in your freezer, we say it can be. 

To craft our Peaches & Cream Tarte, we take a buttery, flaky crust, spread a layer of sweet cream cheese on 
top, fill it with sugared peaches, and carefully fold in its edges. This Tarte-building is all done by hand, so it's 
free-form and unrefined-just how we like it. We bake each Tarte to sunny perfection-glistening orange in the 
center; golden brown at the edges-so that by the time it makes its way to you, all you have to do is heat it up. 

Unlike some frozen, fully-baked desserts, you can warm our Peaches & Cream Tarte in the oven or the 
microwave-just follow the instructions on the package. We recommend keeping a Peaches & Cream Tarte or 
two in your freezer at all times so that you're never caught unprepared for unexpected dinner guests, impromptu 
tea parties, and/or last-minute potlucks. Serve each warm slice with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of 
TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576], and your dining companions will surely be wowed. 

A Tarte like this would easily sell for $11.99 and up in a fine pâtisserie. Lucky for you, we have such a great 
relationship with our Canadian supplier that we are able to offer each 16.9-ounce Peaches & Cream Tarte 
(that's over a pound of sweet, peachy goodness!) for $4.99. You'll find it in our freezer cases.

with rich chocolate chips. Another Hold the Cone!  hallmark are the lined cones. Here, the chocolate cones are 
lined with the same chocolatey coating that tops the ice cream - that creamy cone-lining not only tastes great, 
it also keeps the ice cream from leaking out as you enjoy your Mini Cone. Win! These treats, like their relatives

rich, creamy vanilla ice cream inside.

Enjoy a Tangerine Cream Bar on your front porch, licking a lazy summer day away. On a hot day, get creative 
and place one into a glass filled with sparkling water, then watch it melt down into a memorable mocktail, a la 
an ""ice cream soda."" (Or swap out that sparkling water for a vodka soda, if that's more your speed.) But hurry! If

"053250","Key Lime Pie","Aunt Sally sure knew how to make a pie. And that's good because she was the household cook for a Bahamian 
millionaire with a sweet tooth. The pie that she made for William Curry and his Key West estate in the late 
19th century is today an icon of Floridian food and a celebrated American classic. Trader Joe's now reveals 
our own tart and tasty version of Key Lime Pie-just in time for those hot summer evenings when you don't 
want to bake, but still want to eat like you did.

Backing up just a bit¿ it's not certain Aunt Sally invented Key Lime Pie-only that she made it famous. It is 
likely, however, that this pie populizer (whose last name we don't even know) learned the simple recipe from 
local sponge fishermen. With culinary creativity forged by extended periods at sea, these fishermen would 
have had only a short list of shelf-stable items, including eggs, indigenous citrus, and cans of sweetened, con-
densed milk (the 1856 invention of Gail Borden). Put them together and it's a recipe for pie!

The key to our pie is a smooth custard, with creaminess that conveys a bright, citrusy tartness-balanced with 
just enough sweet. We use the juice of actual Key Limes (not Persians)-call us purists. The custard is cradled 
in a traditional graham cracker-butter-sugar crust that looks and tastes homemade. The pie is ready to eat after 
just two hours thawing in the fridge, and you can enjoy it for up to two days. Gussy it up with some fresh lime 
twists and a little Trader Joe's Canned Whipped Cream [sku #22791]. Ease is the key!

Our frozen Key Lime Pie unlocks the door to dessert at a price that won't get you all keyed up. The 17-ounce 
pie (six servings) is $4.99.

mouth, nervously awaiting the shock of cold that inevitably follows. Under different circumstances, that shock 
would be enough to make you steer clear. But this is about dessert, so steering clear is not an option.

Trader Joe's Non Dairy Chocolate Fudge Oat Bars are, without a doubt, our favorite Bars on sticks in recent 
memory. Each Bar is smooth, creamy, and delicious, just like the fudgy ice cream bars you remember from 
your childhood. The difference here is they're dairy free, made with an oat base. We tell you that because we 
think you should know, but if we didn't say it, we don't think you'd ever guess these weren't made with real 
cream. They're so rich and satisfying, you probably wouldn't guess they only had 100 calories each, either. Of 
course, all of this information is readily available on the box - what you won't find on the box is just how 
sastisfyingly sweet and refreshing they can be, especially on a hot summer's day. Don't wait too long to find out 
for yourself, though: these Oat Bars are a summer-only seasonal treat, and supplies are limited!

"069558","Vegan Pasta Bolognese Bowl","We're lucky to live in a time of pronounced proliferation of plant-based proteins. Nowadays, even dishes that 
are more or less defined by their meatiness are available in vegan form, without sacrificing any of their signature 
texture or savory flavor. Take Trader Joe's Vegan Pasta Bolognese, for example. Traditionally, the heartiness 
of ragù alla bolognese comes from its base of slow-braised beef, pork, or veal, but by using a combination 
of perfectly-textured wheat protein and umami-rich mushrooms, our Vegan Pasta Bolognese evokes that 
typically non-vegan profile in a decidedly vegan way, all packaged together in one convenient, easy-to-prepare, 
frozen meal.

Each 12-ounce bowl of Trader Joe's Vegan Pasta Bolognese comes with a bed of toothsome, tube-shaped pasta 
made from red lentils, which our supplier then tops with a ragu made with tomato, carrot, onion, and garlic, 
in addition to the previously mentioned mushrooms and wheat protein. All together, they create a supremely 
satisfying pasta dish that takes only a few minutes in the microwave to heat up, and provides an impressive 30 
grams of protein per one-bowl serving. Equally suited for vegans and non-vegans, keep one in your freezer for 
an easy, last-minute dinner option, or bring it as a work lunch for meatless Mondays. Whatever your dietary 
preference, Trader Joe's Vegan Pasta Bolognese can be found in our freezers, every day of the week.

with a hot cayenne pepper sauce-to create the tender, cheesy, spicy filling. That filling is folded into layers of

home appetizer that reheats from frozen spectacularly well in your oven and ends up as flaky and satisfying as 
similar apps you'd find at your favorite local haunts.

Mexican restaurant or at a taco stand. By Joe, we've done it! 

Trader Joe's Carne Asada Burritos (there are two!) have chunks of grilled Angus beef combined with chopped 
onions and roasted poblano chiles. We've included cilantro and a zesty lemon pepper seasoning with hints of 
garlic and red pepper. 

All this is wrapped in a special soft flour tortilla. We say ""special"" because we worked with our supplier to find 
a tortilla that would maintain an appealing texture even after being microwaved. Indeed, where most tortillas 
take on a hard or even crispy texture when microwaved, after 1 to 1.5 microwave minutes, this tortilla remains 
soft, with a pleasant chew. Can you imagine it? Now you can enjoy it! You'll find this 14-ounce package of two 
seven-ounce Carne Asada Burritos in our freezers, every day.

We source our Mango & Cream Bars from Australia because we needed these down under desserts stocking 
our shelves for everyone to enjoy! Just fruit and cream are used to bring about these luscious, fresh-tasting 
treats. Wonderfully ripe mangoes are sourced from our Australian family-owned business partners, which 
yields the intense flavor of real fruit for the mango-colored half of the bar. And the familiar flavors of ice 
creamy color the other half, offering a cool balance to its mango partner. With space-age engineering, we've 
developed a fruity frozen bar that needs no little wooden stick; just push the pop right out of the wrapper and 
you'll have a treat with no stick to mess around with once you've wrapped up your snacking session.

us (and for you, really), we're often able to bring our dreams to life, and so, Trader Joe's I Dream of Chocolate 
Cake is here to make your chocolate dreams come true.

We're not exaggerating. There are two layers of very moist, very dark chocolate cake, sandwiching a layer of 
creamy chocolate (almost pudding-like) filling. On top of the cake are cubes of milk-soaked chocolate cake, 
and those cubes are covered with even more chocolate. Beautiful to behold, it's as delicious as it looks, and such 
a great value! We've seen cakes of similar makeup selling in the $20-$30 range - we're selling this Dream come

uses only the best quality ingredients. And they're fully cooked, so all you have to do is reheat & eat! While we 
find that the air fryer is the quickest method (just 5 to 6 minutes), yielding the crispest exterior, our Potato 
Pancakes are equally yummy prepared in a skillet on the stovetop, or in a conventional oven. 

Latkes are, of course, a Hanukkah tradition, but they're not just for holidays. We enjoy our kosher-certified 
Potato Pancakes at breakfast, dinner or anytime in between. Give them a try as a side with your favorite 
delicatessen delicacy, or as the foundation for a fantastic smoked salmon Benedict. Go old school and top them 
with sour cream and apple sauce, or feel free to think outside the box and melt a bit of shredded cheese over 
them as they fry.

"058674","Quiche Lorraine","The origin of the French word quiche is unknown, but it kind of sounds like ""kiss,"" as in: ""Please give me a 
quiche."" That's good enough for us. So, what would make a quiche worthy of such a comparison? In our opinion, 
the quiche would have to be so good it keeps you coming back for more. Trader Joe's Quiche Lorraine is 
exactly that good. 

While we already sell a frozen Broccoli and Cheddar Quiche, and a Spinach and Mushroom Quiche, we've yet to 
provide our customers with the classic from Lorraine, France. The reason for our delay has had to do with¿ 
ham. You see, Quiche Lorraine must not only have a perfectly flaky, savory, buttery crust-it must also have 
plenty of ham. The trouble is, most quality bakeries that can produce a high-quality pastry, are not USDA 
approved; which means, they can only include 3% ham, or less. Not good enough!

After a diligent search, our developers finally found the right supplier in San Francisco. The Quiche Lorraine 
they make for us has a superb pastry crust, and contains about 20% uncured ham. The ham is matched with 
Swiss cheese, both of which are presented in a soft egg custard made from a short list of simple ingredients. The 
Quiche is fully cooked, so you need only heat it and serve, either hot or room temperature. Serve it for breakfast 
with fresh fruit, or for lunch with fresh greens. It feeds four, unless you cut it into smaller pieces and serve it as 
an hors d'oeuvre. So versatile! So quiche-able.

If you find lips are starting to quiver, hurry to Trader Joe's. We'll gladly give you a quiche (Quiche Lorraine, 
that is), and that for only $5.49.

we told you it was possible to enjoy both ice cream and coffee without a bowl or a cup-and also with some 
brownies added into the mix? It seems like something only achievable in dreams, but Trader Joe's Brownie 
Crisp Coffee Ice Cream Sandwiches make those dreams a reality. 

We first take two TJ's Brownie Crisps [sku 55092]. Then, we take coffee ice cream-made with coffee syrup, 
Colombian coffee extract, and espresso grounds-and put a scoop between the brownies. The best part? The ice 
cream softens up the crisps just enough to give them a deliciously fudgy texture-no soggy sandwiches here. 
The chocolaty chunks in the brownie crisps and the espresso grounds in the ice cream make for some sophisti-
cated flavors you might not expect in an ice cream sandwich-but ones you'll be overjoyed to encounter. 

Though these lil' Sandwiches are bursting with coffee flavor, we don't blame you if you want to pair it with even

"067480","Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice With Kimchi","Translated directly from Korean, bulgogi is a compound word that simply means ""fire-meat."" Literal 
translations aside, bulgogi has an even greater significance as a beloved staple of Korean cuisine. Typically 
made by marinating thinly sliced beef in a mixture of soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and spices, then grilling it 
over an open flame, bulgogi is tender, filling, and above all, phenomenally flavorful. Trader Joe's Bulgogi Beef 
Fried Rice with Kimchi pays tribute to this bastion of barbecue by pairing it with chopped veggies and tangy 
kimchi, all together in a deliciously seasoned fried rice.

With minimal prep (just a combined five minutes in the microwave or a few minutes in a hot skillet will do 
the trick), our Korean-inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice becomes a delightfully savory side dish or basis for a 
wide variety of rice bowls - we like it with a few slices of avocado, ourselves. And since this is Trader Joe's, that

we rather like to think of Fiocchetti as little bundles of cheesy joy. That's certainly what you'll get with Trader 
Joe's Cheese Filled Fiocchetti with Pink Sauce, our newest all-in-one frozen pasta entreé that takes pouch-
shaped egg pasta, fills them with three kinds of Italian cheeese, then smothers it all in a luxurious cream-

Preparation couldn't be simpler: with either a microwave and a microwave safe dish, or a bit of water, olive

Warm, savory, and filled with satisfyingly silky textures, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more comforting 
comfort food than pho (pronounced fuh, for the record). Since its creation in late 19th century Vietnam, pho 
has turned into a certified foodie phenomenon, and a staple of noodle shop menus the world over. Of course, 
one doesn't always have quick access to a noodle shop, nor the time to prepare pho from scratch, which is 
why we're introducing Trader Joe's Beef Pho Soup, a traditionally-inspired, sensationally-seasoned, heat-and-
serve way to get your pho fix in a matter of minutes.

Every bowl of our Beef Pho Soup is made with tender, seasoned beef, perfectly-textured rice noodles, and a 
rich, lively broth flavored with aromatic herbs like basil and cilantro. With just six minutes in the microwave 
or ten minutes on the stovetop, this Pho is ready to serve with your choice of toppings: we like thinly sliced 
jalapeños and basil, ourselves. Its ease of preparation and homey, satisfying character make it a great candidate 
for a quick lunch at the office or home, and with a retail of $3.49* for every 13.23-ounce bowl, Trader Joe's Beef 
Pho Soup makes a great everyday value, too. Keep an eye out for it in our freezer case.

"095252","Malabari Paratha","When you read ""Authentic Indian Bread"" on the bag of Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha, it may call to mind 
that same phrase appearing on the bag of our frozen Tandoori Naan [SKU 77677]. You may be thinking: What 
makes Paratha different from Naan?

One difference is in the ingredients. Our Malabari Paratha (made in the tradition of the Malabar region of 
Southern India) includes wheat flour, cow's & buffalo's milk, and a little bit of sugar & salt. In contrast, traditional 
Naan typically incorporates yogurt and yeast in its recipe. Another difference is in the way these breads are 
formed. Our Paratha (like traditional Paratha) is formed by hand using a unique process in which thin rounds 
of dough are rolled into long ropes, which are then rolled into spirals that kind of look like cinnamon buns. 
Finally, they are pressed back into flattened rounds. (Paratha literally means ""layers of cooked flour."") More 
simply, Naan dough is flattened as it's slapped on the inside of the Tandoori oven to cook-which leads to the 
final difference: Trader Joe's Malabari Paratha is cooked on flat, griddle-like stoves.

Heat our Malabari Paratha from frozen in a lightly oiled, non-stick pan until golden, and you'll find a bite that 
is crisp on the outside and soft & moist on the inside. It's the perfect partner for our Indian Fare meals, or any 
of our frozen Indian entrees.

"059065","Mashed Cauliflower","Although mashed potatoes are considered a culinary sidekick, it's difficult to deny how crucial they are to their 
pairing partners. Where, for example, would bangers be without mash? And the Thanksgiving turkey without 
mashed potatoes? Unthinkable. If you're looking to lessen the nutritional impact that accompanies said side 
dish, however, it can be tough to find a creamy replacement that stands up to the might of the mashed potato 
on a dinner plate. Enter Trader Joe's Mashed Cauliflower.

To give this dish dimension, our supplier utilizes not one, but two different cuts of cauliflower-in fact, 
cauliflower accounts for more than 70% of the recipe! Blanched cauliflower bits are simmered with skim milk, 
half & half and butter for creaminess, and then rice flour, garlic, salt and pepper are added to create a velvety 
purée. Finally, larger chunks of cauliflower florets are added to give this Mash toothsome texture. When the 
mixture has cooled, it's punctiliously portioned into petite pucks, so you can prepare what you need when you 
need it, and save the rest for later. Mashtastic!

Serve Mashed Cauliflower alongside a hot-off-the-grill, bone-in ribeye steak. Pair it with Green Jackfruit [sku 
58772] simmered in TJ's Kansas City BBQ Sauce [sku 31314]. With just 50 calories, two grams of fat and seven 
grams of carbs per one-cup serving, it makes for a low-impact-yet flavorful-savory side dish.

"060024","Riced Cauliflower Stir Fry","While there's a certain satisfaction that comes from cooking a meal from scratch, there's equal enjoyment when 
something tastes like it was made from scratch, but cooks in a fraction of the time. The plethora of meal options 
in our freezer cases is a testament to this convergence of convenience and enjoyment-why stand over a hot 
stove or cutting board (and later, the kitchen sink) when you have tasty, pre-prepped meal components, ready 
to heat and eat at a moment's notice? 

Trader Joe's Riced Cauliflower Stir Fry is the newest addition to our user-friendly frozen lineup. A boon to 
the home cook, it starts with a base of blanched, toothsome cauliflower crumbles seasoned with savory tamari 
sauce and nutty sesame oil. Green peas, red bell peppers, grilled corn, and spring onions are added for fresh, 
vegetal flavor and vibrant color. On top of its careful composition, this veggie-party-in-a-bag offers impressive 
nutrition to boot, with just 50 calories, two grams of fat and seven grams of carbs in a one-cup serving.

Were you to create this dish from scratch, you'd be looking at close to an hour of prep & cook time. With a bag 
of this Stir Fry in hand, however, you're mere minutes away from a filling, flavorful side dish. Simply heat 2 
tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick skillet, add stir fry and cook until warmed through, 6 to 7 minutes. Top 
with the cooked protein of your choice, and that side dish becomes a hearty meal (we especially like it topped 
with a fried egg, sliced avocado and a generous squirt of Sriracha Sauce).

In Russia, these dumplings are called pelmeni (a derivative of the word pelnyan, loosely translated as ""bread 
ear"" due to the dumpling's ear-like shape). Historically, they were a convenient means of preserving meat and 
feeding a family over the course of a long winter. At Trader Joe's, they're called Chicken & Mushroom Pelmeni, 
and they're a convenient means of getting a dumpling dinner on the table in a flash.

Trader Joe's Chicken & Mushroom Pelmeni are classic dough-wrapped pockets, made in Southern California 
and assembled in Russian tradition. Stuffed with flavorful chicken thighs and earthy mushrooms, these morsels 
are further seasoned with tender onion, herbaceous dill and tangy sour cream to round out their traditional 
flavor profile-simple, savory, satisfying.

Almost as simple as the ingredient listing is their prep: boil these Pelmeni in salted water for 3 to 4 minutes 
until they float, and serve with melted butter, sour cream or your favorite sauce. Take them a step further with 
a pan fry (post-boil) for a golden, tender-crisp appetizer-not unlike pan-fried gyoza. With about 52 pieces in 
each bag, you'll have enough on hand to ascertain your preferred pelmeni preparation.

We're offering 16 ounce bags of Chicken & Mushroom Pelmeni for $3.99, everyday. You'll find them in our freezers.

"059448","Gluten Free Cheese Pizza With A Cauliflower Crust","First came the Cauliflower Pizza Crust [sku 59139]. It arrived in our freezers, and flew out so quickly that our 
Italian supplier couldn't keep up with demand. Now there's Trader Joe's Gluten Free Cheese Pizza with a 
Cauliflower Crust, a ready-to-bake pizza with a cauliflower-based crust, made for us by a U.S.-based supplier, 
and ready for you to pick up from our freezers.

The crust here uses a blend of cauliflower, mozzarella cheese, potato flour, chickpea flour, and brown rice flour 
to replace the wheat flour you'd find in an ordinary pizza crust. It cooks just as a good pizza should, with a soft 
bite in the center, and just-the-right-crisp around the edges. Topped with a traditional tomato-based sauce and 
a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheeses, this is a pizza that's perfectly at home on any table, whether you're 
a regular gluten free eater or not. Bake it in a 425ºF oven for 10-12 minutes, and enjoy the tangy, cheesy, savory 
flavors, and chewy, crisp-around-the-edges crust. Add your favorite toppings and serve with a green salad for a 
complete gluten free meal! Each 12-ounce Pizza is $4.99, every day. Look for it in our freezers.

"061231","Organic Green Vegetable Foursome","If two's company and three's a crowd, what does that make four? In the frozen case at Trader Joe's, it makes a 
party-a vegetable party, to be more precise. Introducing Trader Joe's Organic Green Vegetable Foursome, 
the newest addition to our frozen vegetable lineup.

Inside each bag of Trader Joe's Organic Green Vegetable Foursome is a verdant vegetable blend of broccoli 
florets, shelled peas, trimmed French green beans, and tender zucchini quarters. The veggies are organically 
grown in France, Italy and Spain, and then combined in France, where they are blanched & gently cooked with 
organic garlic, onions, parsley, and savory spices. This process yields tender-crisp veggies that cook up perfectly 
when you get them home, and don't require further fussing to make them taste phenomenal. What's more, you 
get all this great flavor at a good-for-you 30 calories and 90 milligrams of sodium per 2/3-cup serving!

This versatile medley of organically grown, simply seasoned vegetables is a veritable crowd-pleaser when it 
comes to prepping meals in a snap. Simply sauté and serve! Or, microwave and serve. Or, roast alongside 
salmon en papillote and serve. Or, add it to soup or pasta salad. You could even bake this flavorsome Foursome 
into a hearty frittata with shaved Grana Padano Cheese [sku 25808] for brunch. With this many options, the 
fun never ends¿

We're offering 14-ounce bags of Trader Joe's Organic Green Vegetable Foursome for $2.99 each, everyday. 
You'll find them whooping it up with the other vegetables in our freezers.

"061364","Gluten Free Mac & Cheese","Some years back, we carried a frozen Gluten Free Mac & Cheese in our stores. Made with rice flour pasta, 
white Cheddar, & Monterey Jack cheeses, it was a good, solid, gluten free alternative to standard Mac. Truly. 
But as time went by, we realized that it could be even better. So, with our classic & wildly popular Diner Mac 'n 
Cheese [sku 03655] as her inspiration, our Buyer set out to create the perfect Gluten Free Mac & Cheese once 
and for all-and the rest is history. Or, shall we say, cheesetory. 

Unlike our previous, two-cheese incarnation, Trader Joe's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese is now made with the 
exact same four-cheese blend you'll find in our beloved Diner Mac-Cheddar, Swiss, Havarti, & Gouda, all 
made with milk from cows not treated with rBST. We also add milk & a house-made, gluten free béchamel to 
this four-cheese blend, which makes for a comforting creation that's extra thick & creamy. And lest we miss the 
mac for the cheese (as they say), we've taken equally great care in selecting the perfect pasta: a corkscrew-shaped 
Rotini made with a blend of corn, rice, lentil, & quinoa flours. The end result? A toothsome, weighty Gluten 
Free Mac & Cheese that's just as delish as any of its wheat-pasta compatriots-think, ""Wow, are you sure that's 
gluten free?!"" not, ""Wow, that sure is gluten free¿""

Another Wow? The price: we're selling each 12-ounce package of Trader Joe's Gluten Free Mac & Cheese for 
$3.49, every day. You'll find it in our freezers, ready to be heated up & gobbled down.

"061524","Cauliflower Gnocchi","Calling all cauliflower lovers! If you've been enjoying our ongoing experimentations with this brassica-we've 
riced it, mashed it, grilled it, and put it into patties & pizza crusts-our latest adaptation is likely to gnoc your 
socks off¿ 

Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi (NYOK-kee) is made for us in Italy, and it's quite like those traditional Ital-
ian dumplings made of mashed potato, flour, and egg-hence, the Gnocchi designation. This version, however, 
is made with about 75% cauliflower, as well as cassava flour, potato starch, extra virgin olive oil, and sea salt. No 
wheat, dairy, or eggs are included here, and that translates to fewer carbs, with significantly less fat & calories 
than potato-based varieties. 

Our Italian supplier, who specializes in regular gnocchi, uses the cauliflower they've grown in their own fields 
to create soft-textured bites that are easy to prepare. Sauté and crisp-up in a stovetop pan-our favorite prep 
method that requires no thawing and results in crisp, never-overcooked Gnocchi. You can alternatively boil or 
microwave them for a more tender presentation. And like other gnocchi you've known, these are tasty tossed in 
butter, fresh sage, and Shaved Parmesan Reggiano [sku 83140]. Or, if you prefer, Rustico Pomodoro Pasta Sauce 
[sku 72008] and fresh basil. 

Any way is a good way to dress up our Cauliflower Gnocchi. You'll find 12-ounce bags of Trader Joe's Cauli-
flower Gnocchi in our freezers-and only our freezers-for $2.69 each.

best food and beverages, and sometimes we find them in the most unlikely places. 

So let's talk about Trader José's Chicken Burrito Bowl, shall we? It's a winner. Seasoned chicken breast, 
brown rice, red quinoa, black beans, corn, bell peppers, Cheddar cheese¿ this is a hearty bowl. Its Southwest 
style, smoky chipotle sauce marries all of those flavors and textures together and turns a bowl into a meal. 
With 22 grams of protein in every bowl, it's the real deal, satisfying and delicious. Stick a fork in it and you're 
done! Of course, you don't have to stick a fork in it. You could heat it and then load it into an actual burrito. 
Or tacos. Or you could scoop it onto a bed of greens and make a quickie southwest salad. There's no right or 
wrong way to enjoy our Chicken Burrito Bowl; there is, however, much enjoyment to be had, no matter how

"062481","Riced Cauliflower Bowl","Oh, cauliflower. Is there anything you can't do? As our love for cauliflower continues unabated, product after 
product, there seems to be no end to this veggie's veritable versatility. Recipes that were once dependent on carbs 
have been freed by this bold and brassy little brassica. Take, for example, our Trader Joe's Riced Cauliflower 
Bowl, a classic veggie treat made even veggie-er by simply going against the grain.

Inspired by the fare from some of our favorite vegan restaurants, our Riced Cauliflower Bowl is all about simple 
ingredients, big flavors, and a variety of fascinating textures. We start with a bed of riced cauliflower, topped with 
chopped sweet potatoes, red onions, & tofu. Next, we add chickpeas, which have been cooked and marinated 
in olive oil, then seasoned with chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, & cumin. And for the final, finishing 
touch, we add a little sambal oelek red chili paste, a bit of tamari soy sauce, and a cool, creamy tahini sauce to tie 
all the flavors together. The result is a journey through a plethora of tastes and textures, where each bite is a new 
adventure.

Preparation is a breeze: simply remove your Riced Cauliflower Bowl from its box, cut a one-inch slit in the film 
covering the bowl, microwave for three minutes, then remove the film, mix it together, and microwave for an 
additional two or three minutes. With this level of convenience, the Riced Cauliflower Bowl makes for an ideal 
work lunch or last-minute dinner. Dress it up even further by adding a few slices of avocado or topping it with a 
freshly fried egg for an even heartier experience.

Sure, ""caul"" us romantics if you must, but the introduction of Trader Joe's Riced Cauliflower Bowl starts a 
whole new chapter in the love story between Trader Joe's and cauliflower, and we invite you to come along with 
us. We're selling each ten-ounce bowl for the lovely price of $2.99. You'll find it in our frozen section.

"063304","Shakshuka Starter","Shakshuka has become a certified foodie phenomenon as of late, making appearances on menus of trendy joints 
and gastropubs everywhere. We're all for it: this piquant & peppery powerhouse of Middle Eastern cuisine has 
everything you could look for in a savory, satisfying stew. But sometimes you don't always want to go out to the 
trendy restaurant (or pay trendy restaurant prices) to get your shakshuka fix. And, on the other hand, sometimes 
you don't always have the time to put the ingredients together, yourself. That's why we're introducing Trader 
Joe's Shakshuka Starter: everything you need to create a steamy, slightly spicy Shakshuka in just about five 
minutes - all that's required on your end are a pair of fresh eggs and a microwave.

Starting with a base of tomatoes, bell peppers, garlic, and spices cooked together into a chunky, slightly spicy 
stew, this Shakshuka Starter is an herby, aromatic, vegetarian treat in its own right, but truly excels once it's been 
put together with a pair of poached eggs. Preparation could not be simpler: just puncture the film on your tray 
of frozen Shakshuka, microwave for three minutes, then peel back the film and crack two fresh eggs directly 
into the stew, and microwave again for another two minutes, or until your desired doneness of the eggs has been 
achieved. The eggs will poach directly in the stew, taking in the flavors and spices and adding an unbelievable 
savory element - especially when mixed together and soaked up by a hunk of crusty bread or warm lavash.

In addition to being a real time-saver, this Starter is a real wallet-saver, too: while you'd be hard-pressed to find 
shakshuka at a restaurant for less than $10, each 9-ounce box of Trader Joe's Shakshuka Starter sells for $1.99, 
every day. In other words, if you're looking for an extreme value on a quick, delicious meal, our freezers are a 
great place to start.

"097897","Chicken-less Mandarin Orange Morsels","They're back, they're back! Chicken-less Mandarin Orange Morsels are back! After a bit of a hiatus, you'll 
find this relative of our reigning Customer Choice Awards champion (commonly known as Mandarin Orange 
Chicken [sku 66563]) back in our freezer case where it belongs. Because our Orange Chicken is so wildly popu-
lar, we're happy to say our vegan customers will once again have the chance to experience the deliciousness. 

This offering, of course, involved removing ""chicken"" from the equation. And that involved some tinkering-
but we love tinkering. One of the best things about these Morsels is that if you didn't know they weren't chicken, 
you'd probably think they were chicken. But because they're not chicken, but rather a chicken-y blend of soy, 
this Asian inspired entrée is suitable-and quite delectable-for vegetarians and vegans alike. 

This Chicken-less version, of course, includes that beloved sauce that's sweet, a little spicy, and perfectly com-
plements the meaty-tasting Morsels. Cook according to the directions on the package, and then serve with 
noodles or rice and your favorite green veggies for a complete, easy, meat-free meal. (Our favorite is over Brown 
Rice [sku 93756] and sautéed Bok Choy [sku 98253], garnished with sliced Green Onions [sku 44168].) 

The best part? You can have these Morsels, once again, without spending every morsel you have. Each 9.25-ounce

and delicious. But the fact is¿ it doesn't contain any milk or cream! This Frozen Dessert has ""oat milk"" as its 
base, which is simply crushed oats and water. The base is bolstered by tapioca syrup and coconut oil. And, we've 
kept things vegan by using agave syrup as a sweetener.

This creaminess contains pieces of candied strawberries in addition to the surprise crunch of almond brittle, 
which provides a cool contrast to the smooth, frozen base. And the pretty pink color? It's naturally derived 
from beet juice and annatto-and the strawberries, of course!

The finished product is a pint of pure joy, with all the fruity, creamy flavor of strawberry ice cream-but 
delivered in a vegan Frozen Dessert. Find the 16-ounce container of Trader Joe's Strawberry Non-Dairy Oat

Alla Sorrentina [sku 31890] and TJ's Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola [sku 53022], Customers can't get enough of these tiny,

upside-down, then Trader Joe's Outside-In Stuffed Gnocchi is about to turn it positively inside-out¿

Typically, gnocchi are served with sauce and cheese. Trader Joe's Outside-In Stuffed Gnocchi, however, are stuffed 
with sauce and cheese. Made for us in Italy, the veritable birthplace of gnocchi, they're the classic little wheat-flour-
and-potato pillows that you love, filled with savory tomato sauce and plenty of mozzarella cheese. They cook up

take on the classic comfort food dish, arroz con pollo. Each Bowl is filled with a mix of bright yellow rice 
(courtesy of a hearty application of turmeric), diced red bell peppers and onions, black beans, chunks of sweet 
plantains, and cilantro, which is then topped with chopped, juicy, marinated chicken thigh and a superbly 
savory citrus-and-garlic infused mojo criollo sauce. On its own, this would be a super hearty, profoundly 
delicious treat, but the addition of the mojo (a catchall in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine to describe 
sauces made from peppers, olive oil, and citrus juice) sauce totally kicks it into another gear, with pronounced 
notes of garlic, ginger, and orange zest. ¡Que rica!

"055970","Mixed Mushroom & Spinach Quiche","The Lorraine region in northeastern France is associated with numerous notable cuisines. Potato stew, smoked 
bacon, macarons, and madeleines all have roots of origin, or development in Lorraine-but what first comes to 
mind is their most famous dish, the quiche.

While this region's namesake quiche contains bacon, we sought a meatless version-still hoping to convey the 
richness of flavor that comes with the original. To do so, we traveled to the source (of course!) and found French 
bakers with the traditional knowledge & skills needed to create Trader Joe's Mixed Mushrooms & Spinach 
Quiche.

The crust is made with wheat flour and real butter. The savory custard center consists of eggs, crème fraiche, 
and Emmental Swiss, with chopped spinach, and a blend of White Button & Oyster mushrooms. Just the right 
amount of salt, and nutmeg (that not-so-secret, secret ingredient) help delicately balance all the flavors. The 
umami of the mushrooms, combined with the rich custard makes for a wonderfully satisfying meal (no bacon 
required)-and one with 12g of protein and just 420 calories per serving. (That's the entire 6.17-ounce Quiche!)

Add a simple side salad of Champs Elysees greens [sku 26370], and a glass of Révélation Chardonnay [sku 97161], 
and you might as well be having lunch at a Metz café. It'll cost you much less, though. We're selling the 6.17-ounce 
box containing Trader Joe's Mixed Mushroom & Spinach Quiche for $2.49, everyday. Find it in our freezers.

"059894","Thai Tea Mini Mochi","In a twist on the more traditional mochi-wrapped ice cream we've been selling in our stores for many years 
(which has included such flavors as Green Tea, Chocolate, Strawberry, Pumpkin Pie, and more), Trader Joe's 
Thai Tea Mini Mochi looks like ice cream, eats like ice cream, and yet, contains no cream. Or any dairy, for that 
matter-these Mochi are totally non-dairy and totally tasty.  

Thai Tea Mini Mochi begin with a thin, tender, outer layer of mochi made with glutinous* rice flour. Inside 
that delicate wrapper is a creamy nugget of frozen, ice-cream-like dessert flavored with a strong black tea that's 
native to Northern Thailand. The unique, delicate flavor of our Thai Tea Mini Mochi is inspired by cha-yen-a 
traditional, Thai drink that's made with strongly brewed black (or Ceylon) tea, sugar, and condensed milk and 
served over ice. Except, as promised, the Thai Tea we use to flavor our Mochi doesn't contain milk; instead, it 
contains coconut milk! We've never encountered dairy-free, mochi-wrapped treats quite like these, and we've 
definitely never seen them in ""mini"" form. You likely haven't, either. And once you do, you'll be happy you did.

We're selling each 8.22-fluid ounce package of fifteen Thai Tea Mini Mochi in our freezers for $3.49. Every day.

"059976","Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice","You could say jackfruit is having a moment. And we could say, if we were prone to hyperbole and self-aggran-
dizement, that Trader Joe's has been instrumental in orchestrating that moment. What we will say, clearly, 
is that the early and exciting success of our Green Jackfruit in Brine [sku 58772] led us to the realization that 
American palates have an appetite for jackfruit. And that realization led us to the creation of Trader Joe's Yel-
low Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice.

Jackfruit grows in abundance in Thailand, which is where our supplier is located. They've sourced green 
(unripe) jackfruit here; at this stage in the ripening process, the fruit cooks to a meat-like consistency and 
mild flavor that's ready to take on the flavor of any sauce. Here, we've paired it with a creamy, coconut milk-
based yellow curry sauce, created in-house with a yellow curry paste rich in freshly ground herbs and spices 
including lemongrass, cumin, and turmeric. To release the fragrant aromatics, the curry paste is cooked over 
medium heat, then slowly simmered with coconut milk to create a rich, vibrantly flavored sauce. That sauce 
is the perfect partner to tender pieces of jackfruit and chunks of eggplant and red bell pepper. And what's a 
curry without rice? Incomplete, that's what. So we've included a sidecar of white jasmine rice; its fragrant aroma 
and slightly chewy texture make it the ideal carbohydrate companion for this easy to heat and enjoy entrée.

We're selling each 13 ounce package of Yellow Jackfruit Curry with Jasmine Rice for $2.79, a price that 
proves Trader Joe's does know jack(fruit) about value. You'll find it in our freezers.

to start from (almost) scratch, we offer ready-to-roll, fresh pizza dough in our refrigerated case. For those short 
on time, we have two frozen, top-and-bake options-one organic and one gluten-free-that will help get dinner 
on the table in minutes. We felt our collection of crusts could be even better with inclusion of a vegetable-based 
version, namely, a cauliflower crust. So, our Product Innovator traveled to Italy in search of a cauliflower crust 
worthy of the Trader Joe's name, and came back with Trader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crust.

Italian tradition meets modern nutrition in this tale of pizza crust progression. Nutty, riced cauliflower and 
corn flour form the sturdy base of this gluten free Pizza Crust. Unlike other crusts on the market that are held 
together with eggs or cheese (thus, higher in calories), it's held together with cornstarch, potato starch, olive oil 
and sea salt. This simple grouping of ingredients has a much lower nutritional impact than your standard slice-
one slice (1/6 of the Crust) has just 80 calories, 220 milligrams of sodium, and zero grams of fat. Cauliflower 
Pizza Crust, without the messy prep, and just 80 calories per gluten free slice? Sign us up! 

Prepping this veggie-centric Crust is a snap: preheat the oven to 450°F and cover the frozen crust with sauce, 
followed by cheese all the way to the edges. Add toppings and bake directly on the oven rack until cheese is 
golden on the edges, 8 to 10 minutes. For an even crisper crust, you can bake it prior to adding  the toppings. 
And for breadsticks, simply crisp the plain crust in the oven and slice into pieces for snacking or dipping.

We're upholding the appreciable Trader Joe's tradition of value by offering 10.6-ounce Cauliflower Pizza Crusts 
for $3.99 each, everyday. You can find them in our freezers.

"056309","Honey Walnut Shrimp","By combining ingredients just-so and then freezing them, we can offer meal ideas you wouldn't otherwise think 
of throwing together after a long work day. There just wouldn't be time. But when everything is measured and 
mixed and portioned ahead of time, those ""complicated"" meals suddenly become a whole lot more approach-
able. So the next time you're craving walnut shrimp, don't try to find the time to create it from scratch or call for 
takeout, check out Trader Joe's Honey Walnut Shrimp in our freezer case.

Inspired by numerous restaurant versions of this dish, we set out to create an easy-to-make iteration you could 
have on the table in less time than it would take to have it delivered. What we found with some of the restaurant 
versions was an abundance of batter, and pretty small shrimp. We're using large shrimp and a batter that lightly 
coats the shrimp, yet manages to retain its crunch even after it's been combined with the sauce. (Comparable 
restaurant versions are 40% batter; ours are 30% batter.) Speaking of the sauce, it's a sweet, creamy concoction 
that's finished with a hint of pineapple to give the flavor a bright boost. And we couldn't have Honey Walnut 
Shrimp without walnuts, right? Every package contains candied walnuts you toss with the shrimp and sauce 
before serving. All of the components are packaged separately, and the bag has detailed instructions that will 
yield delicious results. It's not at all complicated, really - sauté or bake shrimp, toss with sauce, top with walnuts. 
You can serve with rice or noodles or oodles of veggies. It's an easy dish you can put together in a snap, leaving 
you with more energy to deal with life's complications outside the kitchen.

We're selling each 12.75 ounce bag of Honey Walnut Shrimp (containing about 18-20 shrimp) for $6.99, every 
day. You'll find it in our freezers.

"061534","Mini Vegetable Samosas","We've sold a couple different versions of Vegetable Samosas over the years [skus 71098, 54731], and in our 
continuing effort to find the ""golden samosa"" (a term we made up to describe the ultimate triangular savory-
stuffed pastry), we've partnered with a Canadian supplier to refine our samosas offering once again¿

Our new Mini Vegetable Samosas are two-bite sized, three-sided pastries with a crisp exterior made from a 
special Phyllo-type dough that creates a multilayered, flaky package for the filling. Speaking of the filling, each 
triangle is packed corner-to-corner with a curry-like mixture of peas, carrots, potatoes, lentils, onions, and 
Indian spices. In fact, the filling is 50% of the recipe (versus about 35% in other brands). The vegetables are 
tender & mildly spicy, filling your mouth with warm flavors redolent of the Indian subcontinent.

Beyond their great taste, it's also worth noting that compared to our previous version (Handcrafted Vegetable 
Samosas, sku 54731] the nutritional profile of these Samosas is significantly improved. One serving (4 pieces/80g) 
has 160 calories (vs. 240 cal), 7g fat (vs. 12g), 260mg sodium (vs. 480mg), and 20g carbs (vs. 28g). Of course, 
we're not trying to take the angle that Trader Joe's Mini Vegetable Samosas are a health food-but it's good 
to know that when you're enjoying them as a snack or among a spread of appetizers, you're getting food that's 
thoughtfully made.

We also think the price is rather thoughtful (if we do say so ourselves)¿ Each 8.5-ounce box of 12 Mini 
Vegetable Samosas is $3.49. Find them in our freezers.

"060577","Gone Berry Crazy!","We are positively bananas for our Trader Joe's Gone Bananas [sku 95341], and you can bet that our customers 
are, too. In fact, those chocolate-covered banana slices are one of our best-selling frozen treats of all time, which 
got us thinking: what other frozen fruit frontiers can we explore? What other tropical treats could be lying in 
wait, yearning to be covered in candy? The answer, it turns out, took us down to the strawberry fields of North-
ern Thailand, where we found our next gastronomic goody to go ga-ga for: Trader Joe's Gone Berry Crazy 
Chocolate Covered Strawberry Slices.

Though the concept is simple, the results are decadent: juicy, delicious Thai strawberries are sliced in half and 
enrobed in luxuriously dark chocolate, then flash frozen. No preparation required - in fact, we discourage you 
from even letting them defrost too much, lest you miss out on their snappy, snackable texture. Simply open the 
box and enjoy as many slices as you care to - which, of course, may or may not end up being the whole box.

While we're sure you'll flip your lid for these strawberries on their own, they also make great company for other 
desserts. We recommend dropping a few onto a sundae, or using them as delectable decorations on top of an 
ice cream cake. And we can't overlook their appeal as a quick dessert solution for an impromptu romantic date, 
especially when paired with a glass of Cecilia Beretta Spumante Rose [sku 59097].

Just like their banana brethren, you'll find Trader Joe's Gone Berry Crazy Chocolate Covered Strawberry 
Slices in our freezers. We're selling each 5.3 oz. box for $2.29. Now that's something to go crazy for.

"065259","Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings","From the same supplier that helped us bring Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings [sku 54988] to Trader Joe's, 
we are thrilled to introduce Trader Joe's Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings. Inspired by the same 
original soup dumplings, xiao long bao, that originated in the Jiangsu province of China, this type of dumpling 
is traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, the small bamboo steaming basket from which it gets its name. In 
English-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup 
(and therefore must be eaten carefully!)  While the original at Trader Joe's is chicken-based, xiao long bao are 
traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers actually adheres closer to culinary tradition.

Where we've veered most from the traditional preparation is with the inclusion of ginger as a major flavor 
player. Our recipe includes just a bit more than five percent ginger, giving these dim sum darlings a sizeable kick 
of pungent, spicy heat. If you have a xiaolong lying around, feel free to use it to prepare these bites. Otherwise, 
you can prep them the easy way, using the microwavable tray in which they're packaged. Two minutes or less in 
your microwave oven yields soft, hot, incredibly flavorful results. We're selling Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup 
Dumplings in a six ounce package of six dumplings. You'll find them in our freezers.

"064672","Organic Açai Bowl","Trader Joe's Organic Açai Bowl was inspired by the Brazilian specialty called Açai na tigela (""acai in the bowl""). 
In addition to being found sold by beach vendors on the Brazilian coast, some versions of this refreshing, fruity 
treat have made their way into specialty smoothie shops all around the U.S.

Our Açai Bowl is composed of organic fruit, including: strawberries, blueberries, and bananas, with unsweetened 
coconut chips, unsweetened coconut beverage-and of course, açai. We've frozen these ingredients together in 
a microwave-safe bowl for quick defrosting. (If you're a planner, you can alternatively just defrost your Bowl 
in the fridge overnight.) Once it's thawed, simply stir to combine and top with the organic, gluten free, ancient 
grains granola (chia seeds, quinoa flakes, amaranth flakes) that's included in a separate packet. 

With relatively little effort, you'll have a refreshing breakfast or snack that delivers 4g protein and 9g fiber in the 
260-calorie bowl. And, with relatively little expense (compared to what you'll pay in a smoothie shop), you'll 
have discovered another big win from Trader Joe's freezers! Each 10-ounce Organic Açai Bowl is $3.99*, every 
day.
