"Flavored Sparkling Waters have truly popped off in recent years. It's not hard to see why-with their subtle, 
fruity flavors that don't overpower the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the act of everyday 
hydration. At Trader Joe's, when we choose to venture into the business of fizziness, we do so with great care...
and that's how you know our new Black Cherry Vanilla Sparkling Water is something special.

Like our other sparkling waters, Trader Joe's Black Cherry Vanilla Sparkling Water is unsweetened, yet 
thanks to an infusion of natural Black Cherry and Vanilla flavors, it still manages to offer a timeless, cherry 
cream soda-esque sipping experience. At zero calories per can, it's a great way to add some light, flavorful fizz 
to cocktails and mocktails, too. Pour a can over ice, add a splash of To The Power of Seven Red Organic Juice 
Beverage [sku 75108], garnish it with an orange slice or a strawberry, and enjoy! It's a sparkling value you'll only 
find at Trader Joe's.

"Everyone could use some extra sparkle. Even the bubbliest person benefits from excess effervescence-and 
we've got just the thing: Trader Joe's Starfruit Sparkling Water. Every can contains water purified by reverse 
osmosis, with added carbon dioxide for a bubbly, crisp mouthfeel. But it's not just the bubbles that make this 
water sparkle; it's also the natural flavors that transform your shimmering glass of Sparkling Water into a 
delicately fruity, fizzy drink.  

Our Starfruit flavor is a delightful fall fizz-sweet, yet slightly tart. It's made with natural starfruit flavor (and 
other natural flavors) that pair perfectly with sparkling water. Each serving (one 12-ounce can*) has zero 
calories, zero grams sugar, zero milligrams sodium... you get the picture!

So, if you're feeling a bit flat today, come give Trader Joe's Starfruit Sparking Water a try. You'll find it on our 
shelves with our wide variety of plain and flavored sparkling waters.

"Everyone could use some extra sparkle-even the bubbliest person benefits from excess effervescence. And 
sometimes, taking that fizz on the road is easier when the container is easier to carry. So we've taken our 1 and 
1.5-liter bottles of Sparkling Winter Sangria Mineral Water [skus 61721 & 62170] and magically transformed 
them into 12-ounce cans (okay, not magic, but the result is magical nonetheless), neatly packed into a box of 
eight.

Trader Joe's Sparkling Winter Sangria Water is a delightful fizz-sweet yet slightly tart. Natural flavors, 
reminiscent of a citrusy sangria, are combined with bubbly, sparkling water to create a delicately fruity, fizzy 
drink. When you take a sip, you'll experience a clean, crisp flavor, thanks to the absence of sugar, artificial 
sweeteners, and sodium. 

These cans of Sparkling Water are ideal for on-the-go hydration-pack them in a lunch bag or hand them out 
as you deck the halls. Create a fancy mocktail at home by pouring in a glass, over ice, embellished with fruit. 
Or add to your favorite wine-based cocktail to make a spritz!

"The quality of any coconut beverage is entirely dependent upon the quality of the coconut. Fortunately for folks 
who go nuts for the stuff (as many of you do), Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from only the finest 
of coconuts, grown on coconut farms in Brazil where the reliably warm climate lends itself to a year-round 
harvest. The coconuts are plucked and drained of their water, then the water-i.e., the Coconut Water-is 
pasteurized and blended with a bit of vitamin C to help maintain its natural color.

The whole thing is a simple process, really-so when you pluck a carton of Trader Joe's Coconut Water from 
our shelves and crack it open, it's easy to picture yourself sipping the stuff straight from the source. Its potassium 
content (about 980mg, or 20% of the recommended daily value, per carton) and convenient, grab-and-go-
format make it an excellent option for post-workout rehydration. It also adds some subtle, coconutty flavor 
to smoothies and mixed drinks. And here's a #ProTip: no matter how you choose to enjoy it, we recommend 
chilling our shelf-stable-until-open Coconut Water in the fridge and shaking it well before serving. Cheers!

"Wild coconuts (which are not really ""nuts,"" but drupes or ""stone fruit"") have three distinct, physical layers. 
However, when you pick up a coconut in most stores, you're probably just looking at the hard, brown, inner 
layer (the ""pit,"" if you will) called the endocarp. When coconuts are young and green, their endocarp is filled 
with endosperm, which consists of white flesh and a watery liquid that serves as nutrition for the growing 
coconut seed. In the language of alternative beverages, we call this liquid, ""coconut water.""

Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from coconuts that are grown on a massive coconut plantation in 
Brazil. Our supplier is situated in a region of Latin America where the climate is ideal for growing coconuts-
and this means they get to harvest them year-round. Within a few days of being plucked, the coconuts are 
drained of their ""water,"" which is then pasteurized and packaged with less than 1% fructose and ascorbic acid. 
Fructose is a natural fruit sugar already in coconut. Adding a little more helps balance the brix count (and 
therefore the flavor), which can vary seasonally. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) helps to maintain the water's original 
color. So... when you pluck this shelf-stable box from our grocery shelves and crack it open, you'll discover 99% 
juice, with a refreshing and authentic taste!

Chill it and shake it well before enjoying a glass, straight up. You might also try blending it into homemade 
soups, or fruit smoothies when you want to add real, coconut flavor. Each 33.8 fluid ounce (one liter) Tetra Pak® 
of Trader Joe's Coconut Water is a value at $2.99. Find it in our grocery section, along with our other shelf-
stable beverages.

"Secluded away in the northern end of Italy's Central Appenine mountain range, the tiny commune of Apecchio 
is home to just shy of 2,000 people and one very important mineral spring: Val di Meti. Known the world over 
for its naturally rich mineral content and crisp, satsifying taste, Val di Meti's crystal clear water has served as 
the source for many a prestigious bottled water brand in its time. And now, it can be enjoyed in every bottle of 
Trader Joe's Italian Sparkling Mineral Water.

Our supplier collects, carbonates, and bottles this Mineral Water directly at the source, so that every sip tastes 
like you're drinking directly from the spring-with a little extra bit of effervescence, of course. With its brisk, 
bubbly, and crisp profile, Trader Joe's Italian Sparkling Mineral Water is both easy-drinking and remarkably 
refreshing, making it an excellent choice in practically any context. Split a chilled bottle amongst friends with 
while enjoying a fancy al fresco dinner in your back yard-add slices of lemon or lime for an extra kick of flavor. 
Pour in a glass with ice alongside your morning shot of our Shade Grown Espresso [sku 97761]. Or simply pull 
a bottle out of the fridge and enjoy whenever you happen to be in need of hydration. Aaahh...

"We find that one of the quickest (and certainly one of the most cost-effective) ways to add some sparkle to

"Flavored Sparkling Waters have truly popped off in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. These ebulliently 
bright & bubbly beverages are an easy antidote to a hot summer's day, and with their subtle, fruity flavors that don't 
overpower (or over-sweeten) the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the everyday act of hydration. 
So whenever we choose to venture into business of fizziness, we do so with great care.To reach a new caliber of 
carbonation, all varieties of our Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural Flavors eschew sweeteneers and 
artificual flavor agents. Instead, we use three simple ingredients: water, CO2, and-you guessed it-natural flavors. 

For our latest seasonal sparkler, those natural flavors are a blend of naturally sweet Blueberry flavor & tart, tangy 
Lemonade flavor-a combination that really sets the new standard for seasonal effervescent excellence. Each can 
of Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural Blueberry Lemonade Flavor contains zero calories, zero grams 
of sugar, and zero miligrams of sodium, so while you'll love it chilled & served on its own (it's the perfect non-
alcoholic BBQ or day-at-the-beach beverage), you can also afford to mix it with a splash of spirits. Or, better yet, 
with a scoop of TJ's Premium Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576] for a summery ice cream soda. 

Join the carbonated craze with our elevated, crisp, & refreshing Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural 
Blueberry Lemonade Flavor today! We're selling eight-packs of 12-fluid ounce cans for $3.29-a value that's 
sure to make a splash!

"What, exactly, is it about Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Water that makes it so remarkably refreshing? The 
answer, as it turns out, is hidden in the question. Within hours of harvesting the coconuts-which, by the way, 
all happen to be of the Namhom variety, grown in Thailand's Ratchaburi Province-our supplier pasteurizes the 
coconut water using a high temperature, short duration method that ensures a safe product, while still retaining 
the vibrancy of the coconut flavor. Then it's bottled, sealed, and kept cold all the way to your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's store, so... What makes this Coconut Water so remarkably refreshing? Keeping it fresh!

With its crisp, slightly sweet profile, rejuvenating hydration potential, and delightful pink-ish hue (a natural 
product of enzymes that are particularly present in Namhom coconuts), Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Water 
ranks among the freshest of our Fresh Beverages. And among other coconut waters, it ranks remarkably high 
in value: each 10 fl. ounce bottle selles for $1.99*, every day.

with the lightly sweet taste of lemon juice and unmistakeable flavor of ginger. The blend of ginger and lemon 
creates a delightfully aromatic, but never overpowering, drinking experience that's truly invigorating. Striking 
a sensational balance between fullness of flavor and easy-going drinkability, it makes for a great companion for 
mid-morning hikes or outdoor summer concerts.

No doubt, one of the best aspects of flavored seltzer is its anytime versatility. Thirsty after a long day of work? 
Make like the hip kids and crack open a can, right out of the refrigerator. Need a non-alcoholic, but still-fancy-
feeling drink to serve at a gathering? You're all set with this snappy lemon-ginger spritzer. A-OK with alcohol? 
Try adding a bit of TJ's Art of the Still Organic Vodka [sku 57854] for a quick-and-easy all-organic cocktail.
