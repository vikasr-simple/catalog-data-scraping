"Much like in the world of plant-derived meat alternatives or gluten free bread, it would be difficult to overstate 
the number of advances made in the field of non-dairy beverages recently. Even in just the past few years, we've 
seen tremendous strides in improved flavors, smoother textures, and more mixable consistencies. There's truly 
never been a better time to be a fan of non-dairy beverages, which is why we surmised it was high time to 
refresh some of our standby dairy alternatives-because whether you're lactose intolerant, vegan, or just prefer 
the taste of non-dairy beverages, we want to be sure you have the tastiest and most versatile options available 
to you. To that end, please welcome to our shelves Trader Joe's Organic Non-Dairy Unsweetened Coconut 
Beverage!

Made via a process of grating the white inner flesh of a coconut to a pulp, then combining it with hot water 
and straining it, this Organic Unsweetened Coconut Beverage offers a superlatively smooth consistency and 
naturally sweet, slightly nutty flavor, but contains no lactose, soy, gluten, or animal products of any kind. And 
to make it an even more apt alternative to milk, our supplier enriches each batch with calcium and vitamins 
A, D, and B12. We recommend using it in any (and we mean any!) context that calls for milk: baking, pouring 
over cereal, mixing coffee drinks or smoothies, making savory sauces, or, of course, simply drinking chilled.

"Hunting for a lactose and dairy-free source of essential vitamins? Looking for a smooth and mild Non-Dairy 
Beverage with a little extra kick of plant-based protein (nine grams per serving, to be precise)? Behold! Trader 
Joe's Organic Unsweetened Soy Beverage is your Non-Dairy dream come true.

Originally discovered in Japan as a by-product of tofu manufacturing, soy beverage-a.k.a. soy ""milk""-first 
rose to stateside prominance in the 1930s, and by the mid-1990s, it had made its way into the hearts and carts 
of dairy-dodgers everywhere. To this day, our Organic Unsweetened Soy Beverage remains one of the most 
beloved Beverages in our stores, thanks to its mild flavor and textural similarity to cow's milk. Add it to your 
morning cup of coffee or tea. Use it to top off a morning bowl of TJ's Joe's O's [sku 36592] or TJ's Organic Instant 
Oatmeal with Oats & Flax [sku 89693]. Or enjoy a tall, cold glass alongside a (vegan) TJ's Speculoos Cookie [sku

"We live in an age when dairy substitutes have become so tasty, you don't have to be sad about missing milk! 
Case in point: Trader Joe's Non-Dairy Chocolate Oat Beverage. Inspired, of course, by the success of our 
original Trader Joe's Non-Dairy Oat Beverages [skus 65148 & 65333], it's a milk-like drink that's made from 
water and hydrolyzed, whole, rolled oats. (Hydrolysis is the breaking down of the oats' starches and conversion 
into proteins & sugars.) 

For this Chocolate version of our oat-ally awesome classic Oat Beverage, we also add cocoa & cane sugar, a 
pinch of salt, a few natural flavors, and a bit of gellan gum to further flavor & thicken the beverage-naturally. 
The end result is a chocolatey-brown beverage that's smooth & creamy in texture, and sweet to the taste. Not 
only is it good to drink (or to enjoy in coffee, protein shakes, or even cereal), it's also gluten free, lactose 
free, kosher (pareve), and vegan! We're selling each 32 fluid-ounce, shelf-stable container of TJ's Non-Dairy 
Chocolate Oat Beverage for $2.49*. Find it in our grocery aisle among our other shelf-stable beverages.

"With their mild flavor and creamy consistency, oat-based beverages continue to be among our most popular 
plant-based potables. So much so, in fact, that we decided the time was right to expand on the smooth, easy-
going flavor of our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage [sku 65333] with a vanilla-tinged variant. Made for us by the 
same supplier as our original version, Trader Joe's Unsweetened Vanilla Non-Dairy Oat Beverage differs 
from its predecessor in two crucial ways: first, of course, is the light touch of vanilla that's present in every sip. 
Second, instead of fully hydrolyzing the starches in the oats into sugar, our supplier only lets them break down 
partially, resulting in a drink that's not only free of added sugar, but in fact contains a total zero grams of sugar 
per serving. Oat-standing!

Ideal for mixing into smoothies, pouring over breakfast cereals, or creating a super oat-powered batch of 
overnight oats, our vegan, gluten free Unsweetened Vanilla Non-Dairy Oat Beverage's silky texture and 
delicate vanilla notes are especially suited for sweeter endeavors. We recommend adding a splash to your 
morning coffee, tea, or cold brew for a little extra body. And if you're simply looking for something smooth 
and satisfying, but never overly sweet, a tall glass of ice-cold Unsweetend Vanilla Oat Beverage is always a 
great idea.

forbearer, with a fall-inspired twist. It's gluten free, dairy free, lactose free, and vegan. That rich, maple flavor

"Ah, egg nog. This classically creamy beverage first started as a holiday tradition in North America all the way 
back into the 17th century, if you can believe it. Ever since, it's been celebrated for how spectacularly suited it 
is to turn any cold winter night into a cozy, comforting, mini retreat. Its iconic status has afforded it a festively 
fervent fanbase - especially among our customers. That's one reason why we've so keen to kick things up a 
nog with Trader Joe's O' Nog, a very merry non-dairy nog that calls on the power of oats to deliver the same 
creamy, satisfying, nutmeg-and-ginger profile as its classic counterparts, but with all vegan ingredients. 

Whether you'd prefer to sip a glass during the presents-unwrapping frenzy, or just enjoy a tumbler-full with a 
splash of rum in front of the fireplace, our sweet, creamy, and lightly spiced O' Nog is more than up to the task. 
In fact, it makes a great ingredient in situations other than just seasonal sipping, too: try pouring a bit in your 
morning oatmeal, using it to make a super luxurious bread pudding, or even just mixing a bit in your coffee to 
give it a bit of extra holiday cheer. Just be sure to grab a carton before too long, because supplies are limited!

"We already sell a couple of oat-based beverages, and let's just say that our customers who avoid dairy have 
been eating - or rather, drinking - them right up! (Many of our dairy-drinking customers are also known to 
imbibe...) So it only made sense, during this season, to add a little pumpkin to the mix. Literally.

Like its non-pumpkin predecessors, Trader Joe's Non-Dairy Pumpkin Oat Beverage gets its creamy, milk-
like texture and flavor from a simple base of hydrolyzed oats and water. Then, for a fall makeover to remember, 
we add the seasonal stuff: pumpkin purée, natural pumpkin-spice flavor, cane sugar, and a little sea salt for 
balance. While no one is stopping you from drinking your Pumpkin Oat Beverage straight from the source, 
there are so many more ways you can enjoy it. Make it the base of a seasonal smoothie. Pour it in a bowl with 
TJ's Maple Pecan Clusters Cereal [sku 40501]. Or, go all out and add a splash to your morning TJ's Pumpkin 
Spice Coffee [sku 97234]! 

You'll find 32-fluid-ounce cartons of vegan, gluten free, kosher-certified Non-Dairy Pumpkin Oat Beverage 
on the shelf with our other non-dairy beverage options... while supplies last.

"Who knew oats and water combined could be mildly milky-sweet? Instead of adding cane sugar to our new 
Non-Dairy Oat Beverage (which you'll find in many store-brand oat ""milk"" beverages), we unearthed its 
natural, balanced sweetness by breaking down the starches present in the oats to create sugar. What you get 
is a slightly sweet, delightfully smooth, and criminally ""creamy"" vegan Oat Beverage that's perfect for cereal, 
smoothies, lattes, & more. Or just pour a glass and enjoy it on its own, at any time of the day.

"Why have one nut when you can have three? This question, posed by one of our intrepid Product Developers, 
was the driving force that spurred her to seek out a nut-based beverage for the ages-one that would rise above 
the rest, the creamiest, dreamiest, nut-based beverage on the market. (It may sound dramatic, but we're serious 
about nut beverages around here.) Thankfully, her tireless tasting efforts paid off, in the form of Trader Joe's 
Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia Nut Beverage.

Our supplier has packed not one, but three different types of Nuts into this Beverage: fragrant Almond, buttery 
Cashew, and creamy Macadamia. A touch of sea salt is added to enhance these inherently nutty flavors. Free 
of dairy, gluten, lactose, and soy, this vegan, kosher-certified Beverage also happens to be incredibly tasty. And 
each one-cup serving clocks in at just 30 calories and 120 milligrams of sodium!

To experience the best this Nut Beverage has to offer, we recommend chilling it, and giving the container a 
good shake before serving. Come to think of it, it would be delicious in a shake, with TJ's Chocolate Ice Cream 
[sku 78572]. Or use it in place of water when whipping up a batch of Toasted Coconut Pancakes [sku 53170]. 
The usual suspects (cereal, oatmeal, baked goods, et al.) would get a beneficial, non-dairy boost from the nutty 
flavors of this Beverage, no doubt.

What's almost as nutty as Trader Joe's Unsweetened Almond, Cashew & Macadamia Nut Beverage? The 
price. We're selling 32-fluid ounce containers for the WOW value of $2.29, everyday. You'll find it with our 
other shelf-stable beverages.

"Called ""haldi doodh"" in India and ""golden milk"" in most western countries, the combination of milk and 
turmeric has been used in Ayurvedic practices for centuries. This prized, bright golden-yellow drink can be 
made with virtually any liquid, but we've opted for a smooth, non-dairy, coconut beverage base in our version-
which we're calling, fittingly, Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage.

Crafted with honey, turmeric powder, ginger juice, cinnamon, & black pepper, Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger 
Coconut Beverage is a subtly sweet take on a satisfying, spiced classic. It's simultaneously refreshing and 
comforting and can be enjoyed hot or cold. In most settings, golden milk is enjoyed as a beverage all on its own, 
but it's beyond lovely in a latte-just use it as a milk substitute. 

Trader Joe's Turmeric Ginger Coconut Beverage also makes the perfect base for a chia seed pudding. You can 
play-up the pudding as you please, but our go-to recipe is as follows: combine 1 cup Turmeric Ginger Coconut 
Beverage, ¿ cup TJ's Organic Chia Seeds [sku 54256], and 2 tsp. TJ's Honey [any sku] in a large bowl; stir the 
ingredients thoroughly, until all clumps are eliminated; cover the bowl with a TJ's Waxed Cotton Food Wrap [sku 
62528]; place it in the fridge & leave it to thicken overnight; then serve the pudding chilled, with an optional 
sprinkle of TJ's Turmeric [51744].

We're selling each 32-fluid-ounce, shelf-stable carton of gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, lactose-free, kosher-

"Yes, hemp is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant, but its usefulness extends far beyond therapeutic drugs. 
Hemp has been used for centuries to make clothing, rope, and paper-and the seeds of the plant have been 
used in baking and even to make beverages, as in Trader Joe's Unsweetened Non-Dairy Hemp Beverage.

Our Beverage is very simply a base of shelled hemp seeds that have been crushed and blended with water. 
(Think almond ""milk,"" but with hemp seeds instead of almonds.) Added to that is a little sea salt for balanced 
flavor and some emulsifiers to provide a silky-smooth texture. The aroma and taste is slightly nutty; even beany, 
if you will. In fact, it's surprisingly refreshing! And if you're looking for a plant-based alternative to dairy, this 
Hemp Beverage works on all the same eating occasions as milk: in cereal, coffee, tea, smoothies, or just chilled 
in a frosty mug.

"We live in an age when dairy substitutes have become so tasty, you don't have to be sad about missing milk! 
Case in point: Trader Joe's Non-Dairy Oat Beverage.

This is a milk-like drink that's made solely from water and hydrolyzed, whole, rolled oats. Hydrolysis is the 
breaking down of the starches in the oats into proteins and sugars. This simple process results in an off-white 
beverage that is smooth & creamy in texture, and slightly sweet to the taste-without the addition of cane 
sugar.  Not only is it good to drink (or to enjoy in coffee, tea, cereal, smoothies¿), it is also gluten free, lactose 
free, kosher (pareve), and vegan!

We're selling each 32 fluid-ounce, shelf-stable container of Non-Dairy Oat Beverage for $2.29*. Find it in our
