"Our selection of Trader Joe's Whole Turkeys [skus 90351, 57035, 95290] is ideal when you're planning a larger 
gathering. But if you're dining with just a few friends, we recommend Trader Joe's Herb Seasoned Brined 
Bone In Half Turkey. We've split a no-antibiotics-ever, Bone In Turkey right down the middle and Brined 
one Half with a rub of traditional poultry spices. Before we vacuum seal it for freshness, we top it with a disk 
of compound butter and a sprig of fresh rosemary. 

At home, you simply open the package, place the Half Turkey and contents on a baking sheet, tuck the butter 
disk between the skin and breast, and then roast it in your oven. Because it sits flat on the tray, the bird cooks 
evenly, and the skin easily crisps to a golden brown. Perhaps best of all, our Half Turkey takes an estimated 65 
to 86 minutes to reach its finished temperature of 165°F. That's less than Half the time it typically takes to cook 
a full size bird. This approach is so simple, and the result is so beautiful and delicious, you just may choose to 
cook two or three Halves and invite more guests!

You'll find Trader Joe's Herb Seasoned Brined Bone In Half Turkeys in our refrigerators for Turkey season.

"Trader Joe's Fully Cooked Uncured Bacon is one the handiest products to keep in your fridge. Sometimes you 
want bacon, but you don't really want to cook bacon, with the time that can entail. If a package of Fully Cooked 
Uncured Bacon is there waiting for you, you can have your bacon and eat it, too. Far from the ""bacon"" bits of 
old, this is apple wood smoked bacon that's fully cooked, packaged and refrigerated, so it's ready to heat (very 
quickly) and eat. As if bacon really needed to be more appealing¿ yet this really does make it more appealing! 
Just think of the possibilities¿ BLT's, bacon cheeseburgers, bacon & eggs, crumbled bacon on your salad or 
baked potato, and of course, pizza¿ all without the mess that comes from cooking the bacon. Genius!

Each 3.25 ounce package of Fully Cooked Uncured Bacon contains 15 cooked slices of bacon - the equivalent 
of about 12 ounces of uncooked bacon. And ours is a thicker cut than most, which results in rich, full flavor 
in every slice.

"While most folks would probably peg the hamburger as the most representative American food, we'd have to 
throw our support behind the humble hot dog. Aside from its close association with baseball (the American 
national pastime) and summertime (arguably the most American season, though that's another topic 
altogether), only pizza comes close to the hot dog in its proliferation of regional variation throughout these 
United States. Practically every major American state and city has their own specific spin on hot dogs, from the 
vibrantly vegetal Chicago dog, to the chili-and-onion-smothered dogs of Coney Island, to the bacon-wrapped 
hot dogs of Los Angeles. And so, to help celebrate the holistically American hot dog, we proudly offer Trader 
Joe's Uncured Beef Hot Dogs, to be enjoyed in whatever preparation you prefer-from sea to shining sea.

Our all-Beef, Uncured Hot Dogs contain no added nitrates or nitrates (except those that occur naturally in sea 
salt and cultured celery powder), and cook up wonderfully well on the grill, in the frying pan, or immersed in 
boiling water (or beer, we should add!). Once heated through, they have a fantastically snappy texture to their 
bite, and take well to all kinds of condiments and fixings. No matter which regional variation you subscribe to, 
or even if you just enjoy it with a simple drizzle of ketchup and/or mustard, our Hot Dog Buns [sku 98214], and 
Brioche Hot Dog Buns [sku 66433] will make an invaluable vehicle for them.

"One of the great joys of the warmer months is grilling your own burgers at home. Trader Joe's has always been 
an enthusiastic supporter of home-grillers, with our top-quality ground beef options, such as 85/15 Organic 
Grass Fed Ground Beef [sku 92558], and 80/20 Ground Beef Patties [sku 55923]. For those looking for a ready-
for-the-grill burger with a uniquely flavorful twist, you'll want to try Trader Joe's Angus C.B.P. Ground Beef 
1/3 lb. Patties.

This is a Ground blend of three different whole-muscle cuts of Angus beef. Angus refers to the more muscular 
Aberdeen Angus cattle breed, which yields meat with plenty of fat marbling. This marbling translates into juicy, 
tender meat. More specifically, this C.B.P. blend incorporates Angus cuts from the shoulder (Chuck), chest 
(Brisket), and rump (Picanha). The Brisket (20% of the blend) and Picanha (5%) each contribute amazingly 
rich flavor, with their slightly fattier composition, while the leaner and more conventional ground Chuck 
(75%) brings additional 'beefiness' and balance.

All of this amounts to a Ground Beef blend that is about 75% lean/25% fat-ideal for quick, hot grilling. And 
the substantial size of these pre-portioned 1/3 lb. Patties allows them to remain tender & juicy, even when 
cooked over the flames. The resulting bigger burgers will also easily fill TJ's Brioche Buns [sku 61752] to satisfy 
even the hungriest BBQ-goers-but only for a limited time. Find 21.3-ounce (1 lb. 5.3 oz.) packages of four

"When you read the words ""juicy burger,"" turkey is not likely the first meat that comes to mind-but what if it 
was? Our product developer set out to answer this very question while working to create summertime stars 
for grilling season (May to September, to be precise), and much to our tasting panel's delight, he emerged 
victorious from the test kitchen with Trader Joe's Caramelized Onion & Bell Pepper Turkey Patties.

Made with 100% thigh meat, these grill-ready Turkey Patties are unbelievably-dare we say impossibly-juicy. 
The Caramelized Onion brings plenty of umami to the table, while the vegetal sweetness of the Bell Pepper 
deftly complements the savory Turkey in each tender bite. Thanks to their fuss-free prep and quick-cooking 
nature, you'll have more time to ponder your preferred burger accoutrements (Brioche Bun [sku 61752]? Sliced 
Swiss Cheese [sku 73333]? Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce [sku 27677]? Yes, yes, and oh, yes!), as well as more time 
to bask in the glow of a relaxing summer's evening. For a limited time, you'll find this incredibly priced, grilling 
season must-have in the refrigerators at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"Though we're very proud of what we offer in our stores, we believe there's always room to improve. We listen 
to customer feedback and spend lots of time assessing (and re-assessing!) the quality of our products through 
regular tastings. And even when there's no beef about it, it's not rare for us to designate an item for further 
development. 

Speaking of rare beefs, we've taken a recent opportunity to improve some of the Steaks we stock in our fresh 
meat case. Our 100% Angus Rib Eye Steak, New York Strip Steak [sku 56224], and Filet Mignon Steak [sku 
56226] are now all sourced specifically from Argentina-considered by many to be the best country for 
Angus beef in the world-to ensure consistent quality across the whole line. Our supplier's cows are pasture-
raised in the idyllic plains of the Argentine Pampas, fed an all-vegetarian diet, and finished on corn for at 
least 150 days, all of which which results in full flavor, even marbling, and a delightfully tender texture. 

In butcher's terms, a Rib Eye is a rib steak with the bone removed. From the rib cage area, it's a muscle that's 
only lightly worked, making it one of the more tender steaks available. And as the ""eye"" (center), it's also the 
most flavorful part of the rib steak. In addition to making a great protein for soups, pastas, and salads when 
sliced thin, Rib Eye typically takes well to fast-and-hot methods of preparation, and ours are no exception: we 
recommend giving it a quick grill or pan-sear, and finishing with a pat of butter.

"Who doesn't love the meaty bite, savorily seasoned character, and ease of preparation that characterize 
the hot dog-especially when backyard chefs begin firing up the grill. And when it comes to Trader Joe's 
Organic Uncured Grass Fed Beef Hot Dogs, that love even extends to what goes into making this beloved 
tubular meat.

Generally speaking, hot dogs are notorious for containing questionable ingredients, but ours have an incredibly 
attractive and uncomplicated list of ingredients. The very first ingredient is USDA certified Organic Beef 
that comes from Grass Fed cows, yielding delicious flavor. You'll also find sea salt and celery powder in the 
ingredients. These serve not so much as flavoring, but to effectively ""cure"" our Uncured Dogs, allowing us to 
leave out unwanted preservatives, such as nitrates & nitrites. What else goes into our Organic Uncured Grass 
Fed Beef Hot Dogs? The rest of the ingredients are all organic seasonings, things like garlic puree, minced 
onion, paprika, and red pepper flakes. No fillers. No kidding.

"Whether you're making a quick weeknight dinner, putting together a weekend lunch, or meal-prepping for the 
week ahead, it's always a good idea to have some pre-cooked chicken breast on hand. In addition to it being 
a positive powerhouse of protein, chicken breast is also incredibly good at holding on to all kinds of flavors, 
making it a potential powerhouse of flavor, too. Both of these aspects are particularly present in Trader Joe's 
Grilled Chili Lime Chicken Breast, a longtime favorite of our Midwest stores, and that can now be found in 
our East Coast stores, too!

Made with a blend of seasonings that includes chili powder, paprika, dried garlic, cumin, as well as a touch of 
lime juice concentrate, each bite of this pre-cooked, pre-sliced, and ready-to-eat Chicken Breast is bursting 
with savory and citric notes. It can be enjoyed as a topper for a salad, rice bowl, or pasta, as a filling for a 
sandwich, burrito, or omelet, and even heated up with sautéed onions and peppers for a super easy fajita meal. 
And for those watching your macros, here's another reason to be excited: each serving contains a whopping 
24g of protein!

"Believe it or not, Trader Joe's Organic High Protein Super Firm Tofu has been a favorite in our refrigerators 
for 12 years and counting. What makes it so super? It starts with sprouted soybeans that have been triple-
washed, soaked, and ground; after this mixture is heated, the soy curds are compressed to remove even more 
liquid than you would when making extra firm tofu-hence its Super Firm status. And while extra firm tofu 
offers nine grams of protein in a three-ounce serving, this Super Firm Tofu boasts an impressive 14 grams of 
protein for the same serving size-Super, indeed!

With its pleasantly mild flavor and dense (dare we say meat-like) texture that holds up beautifully when sliced, 
sautéed, grilled, or fried, this hearty Tofu is a proverbial blank slate for dips, sauces, and dressings of all kinds.

"If you make homemade pizza using Trader Joe's Deli ingredients, such as TJ's Pizza Dough [sku 92334], and 
TJ's Pizza Sauce [sku 54874], you're probably also familiar with the non-TJ's pepperoni brand we've sold for 
many, many years. (By the way, if you don't make homemade pizza using Trader Joe's Deli ingredients, you're 
missing out!) Obviously, we've always liked the pepperoni we've carried, but now... you can get Trader Joe's 
Sliced Uncured Pepperoni in our Deli selection!

Trader Joe's Pepperoni is made with Uncured pork, which means that it has no added nitrates or nitrites, 
except those naturally occurring in sea salt and celery powder. This classic pepperoni is Sliced thin (but not 
too thin), with a savory & robust flavor profile that's been specifically crafted to be enjoyable cold or hot. This 
matters because we know pizza isn't the only thing on your pepperoni menu. TJ's Pepperoni tastes as good 
baked on a TJ's Pizza Crust [sku 54225], as it does in a charcuterie spread with other TJ's cold cuts, like our 
Uncured Salame Di Parma Mild Salami [sku 58940], and our Sliced Prosciutto [sku 98861].

So, put some pep in your pie (or on your cheeseboard) with the addition of Trader Joe's Sliced Uncured 
Pepperoni, and rest in the confidence that this traditional topping now has TJ's official stamp of approval, just 
like the other everyday TJ's pizza ingredients in our Deli section.

"Cod is one veritably versatile fish. Firm, yet remarkably flaky in texture, with a mild, delicately sweet flavor 
profile, it's equally delicious whether its baked, blackened, steamed, or sautéed. In other words, it's precisely the 
kind of fish you want to have on hand during the spring, when fish fries and seafood boils are just beginning 
to warm up. That's why, for the season, we're carrying Trader Joe's Cod Fillets, a delicious, all-purpose, wild-
caught whitefish option for everything from tangy fish tacos, to creamy seafood chowders, and classic fish 
and chips.

Our Cod Fillets are caught in the wild using longline fishing to help minimize bycatch, and arrive in the 
package boneless and skinless for ease of cooking. They can be prepared in all kinds of dishes with all levels 
of complexity, from the sublimely simple (baked with a bit of butter, lemon juice, and crushed Golden Rounds 
[sku 94889]) to the delightfully complex (glazed in miso paste and broiled until crisp). We particularly like 
them breaded or beer battered, then fried to a golden brown for an unbeatable fried fish sandwich.

"Salmon is far and away the most popular fresh seafood that we carry at Trader Joe's, and it's easy to see why. 
Nutritious, versatile, and remarkably easy to work with, salmon typically only needs a bit of seasoning before 
it's ready to be cooked. Over the years, we've received many requests from our customers for pre-seasoned 
salmon, to make it even easier to go from the fridge to the dinner table. That's precisely why we're introducing 
Trader Joe's Blackened Salmon to our fresh meat and seafood section. 

These boneless, skin-on fillets come prepped and ready with a mélange of savory (and slightly spicy) seasonings, 
including garlic, onion, smoked paprika, chipotle peppers, and demerara sugar on its surface. As it cooks in the 
pan, oven, broiler, or especially the air fryer, this layer of seasonings creates a flavorful and texturally satifying 
Blackened outer crust. A sublimely simple entrée option for everything from busy weeknight dinners to meal-
prepped work lunches, and beyond, we recommend pairing Trader Joe's Blackened Salmon with a bed of 
fluffy white rice, a few spears of steamed asparagus, and an oaky, buttery Chardonnay, like our very own Big 
Churn [sku 56083].

simply looking to incrementally reduce your meat consumption (flexitarian pizza party, anyone?), our Vegan

"Meatballs are so much more than just a topping for spaghetti. In fact, they may be one of the more versatile 
forms of protein around. As Trader Joe's Chicken Meatballs demonstrate (to a decidedly delicious degree, we 
might add) a good meatball delivers tender texture, deeply savory flavor, and affords the opportunity for all 
kinds of rich, aromatic seasonings. True to form, Trader Joe's Chicken Meatballs can be enjoyed in all kinds 
of culinary situations, be it in a stir-fry, sandwich, or soup, or even simply enjoyed on their own, accompanied 
by your favorite dipping sauce, as a quick and easy appetizer.

They're made especially for us by a supplier who uses all natural, ground chicken breast and thigh meat, 
seasons it with oregano, basil, and black pepper, and hand-crafts it into ideal, one-or-two-bite sized Meatballs 
before fully cooking them. That means, once they reach your home, all you need to worry about is reheating 
them, which can be done on your stovetop, or in the microwave, oven, or air fryer in a matter of minutes. Easy, 
versatile, and delicious? We suppose it's no wonder that these Chicken Meatballs are so well-rounded.

"When you think of steak, you more likely than not think of a thick, juicy filet mignon, or ribeye, or strip steak 
served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables. You wouldn't be wrong, because that is steak. But it's not 
exactly the kind of steak we're talking about when we talk about the newly introduced Trader Joe's Shaved Beef 
Steak. This is quite the opposite of a thick cut (but no less tasty)¿

Shaved steak normally comes form the round, which is tougher, but our Shaved Beef Steak comes from the 
cap of the rib eye, making it especially tender and flavorful. In addition to the quality cut, the beef is all natural, 
meaning it comes from cows never treated with antibiotics, ever. 

Because the slices are so thin, pieces of this Shaved Steak cook up very quickly-no need to worry about un-
der- or overcooking! And its easy preparation might only be matched by its versatility. In the mood for stir 
fry? Shaved Steak makes the perfect protein addition. Fajitas? No problem. Beef soup on a cold day? Sure. Or

"Sockeye salmon do not have distinctive eyes. They do, however, have distinctive, red-orange colored flesh. In 
fact, ""sockeye"" is an Anglicized version of suk-kegh (""red fish"") from the language of one of the indigenous 
peoples of British Columbia.

Indeed, our Sockeye Salmon presents this peppy hue. It's wild-caught in the icy waters of the major Northeast 
Pacific fishing area located west of Canada and south of Alaska. Our supplier dry cures the Wild Sockeye 
then smokes it very slowly over applewood (from Washington state apple trees) at a relatively low temperature 
(below 85°F) to yield firm-textured fish with rich salmon flavor, and hints of smoke & salt.

The finished fish is already trimmed and boned, ready to top a bagel. Add it to eggs or pasta. Or, mix some with 
Whipped Cream Cheese [sku 12498] for a swift and superb salmon spread.

"The Italian Minister of Food has selected porchetta as one of Italy's most important and culturally relevant foods. 
Trader Joe's supports this decision. We'd like to show our support by introducing our Uncured Bacon Wrapped 
Porchetta Pork Roast. 

We've taken tender pork loin, rubbed it in herbs (sage, rosemary, and oregano), and wrapped it in Uncured 
Applewood Smoked Bacon. (Uncured, meaning we didn't add any nitrites or nitrates, except those found natu-
rally in celery powder and sea salt.) If it sounds indulgent, it is-after all, this is a holiday item. 'Tis the Season! 

Aside from the recipe, what makes our Porchetta Roast so spectacular is the fact that we've already assembled it 
for you. You simply take the three pound roast (weight varies from 2.75 lbs. to 3.25 lbs.) and roast it in the oven. 
Meticulous directions-including resting times, variable oven temperatures, and cook times-are included on 
the label, so don't discard it right away. We do recommend you use a meat thermometer for best results. When 
you do, you'll end up with a deep, golden-brown roast that carries the intoxicating aromas of sage, garlic, bacon, 
and pork. The crisp, bacon crust on the outside gives way to succulent, tender pork-each bite also conveying 
notes of smoke, and earthy herbs. 

Trader Joe's Uncured Bacon Wrapped Porchetta Pork Roast is a seasonal item that we're only selling for the 
holidays. Each three pound (approximately) Roast is $6.99 per pound. Find it in our refrigerated case with our 
other prepared roasts and fine fresh meats.

"We may be known for our Thanksgiving turkeys, but we're not afraid to ham it up from time to time-especially 
when the Hams we happen to be hawking are so darn delicious! Moist, tender, and full of flavor, Trader 
Joe's Spiral Sliced Uncured Hams come from pigs raised without the use of antibiotics, added hormones, or 
gestation crates. What's more, they contain no added nitrates or nitrites-except what's naturally present in 
celery powder and sea salt. 

Our Hams come conveniently Spiral Sliced, allowing the meat to stay connected to the bone until gently 
removed with the twist of a fork. They also come fully cooked, so all you have to do is warm it in a 275ºF oven, 
for 12 to 15 minutes per pound. (This translates to around 2 hours, since we're selling these Hams by the half-
about 8 to 9 pounds each). Heck, we even include a packet of sweet glaze-simply baste it over your heated 
ham, and you'll have a bonified holiday hit on your hands!

"If you're looking to up your charcuterie game as you head into head into the holiday season, look no further than 
Trader Joe's Finocchiona Uncured Salami. Our Chicago-based salumist starts with heritage-breed, crate-free 
pork (which means the animals were not restrained in gestation or farrowing crates), raised without the use 
of added hormones or antibiotics. They combine this flavorful, high-quality pork with Lambrusco red wine, 
Sicilian sea salt, piquant black pepper, and toasted, ground fennel seeds to create the fragrant Finocchiona 
profile, commonly found in salumerias throughout the Italian region of Tuscany. What's more, this Salami 
is Uncured, containing no added nitrates or nitrites, except what's naturally present in celery and sea salt. 
Benissimo! 

To serve this Finocchiona Uncured Salami, slit the inedible casing with a knife along the base, then lengthwise, 
and peel the casing to expose only the portion you'd like to eat. For the ultimate Tuscan countryside experience, 
we recommend slicing it on the bias and presenting it on a board with thinly sliced TJ's Pecorino Romano [sku 
18326] and fresh Fennel [sku 95748], and a glass of fruit-forward red wine, like Ruggero Di Bardo Susumaniello

"If you're looking to up your charcuterie game, especially heading into the holidays, Trader Joe's Spanish Style 
Uncured Chorizo can help. Unlike Mexican style chorizo, which is typically raw and needs to be cooked before 
eating (like TJ's Soy Chorizo [sku 92463]), Spanish Style Chorizo is more like a typical salami, ready to eat 
right out of the package. 

To make this Spanish Style Chorizo, our Chicago supplier starts with heritage-breed pork, with no added 
hormones, and no antibiotics, ever. It's also crate-free pork, which means the animals were not restrained 
in gestation and farrowing crates. The recipe-which includes red wine, sea salt, black pepper, and smoked 
paprika-provides an eating experience beyond typical salami. In particular, the richness of the red wine, and 
the hint of smoke from the paprika give this Chorizo a one-of-a-kind profile.

We suggest thinly slicing Trader Joe's Spanish Style Uncured Chorizo on the bias, and presenting on a board 
with the likes of Trader Joe's Spanish Cheese Tapas Sampler [sku 97350], slices of TJ's Olive Fougasse [sku 75006],

"Prepped and ready to cook right away, TJ's BBQ Seasoned Spatchcocked Chicken comes pre-spatchcocked 
(that is to say, butterflied and flattened) and marinated in a mix of apple juice, maple syrup, honey, mustard 
and coffee, along with a tasty blend of peppery BBQ seasonings. Since the Chicken is flattened, and thus has 
more surface area, it will both cook more quickly, and retain more moisture through the cooking process than 
your everyday, non-butterflied bird. In other words, this chicken may be flat, but its flavors are anything but.

To prepare, simply remove the BBQ Seasoned Spatchocked Chicken from the bag and place it skin-side up 
on a pre-heated grill until well-browned and its internal temperature reaches 165°F on a meat thermometer. 
Or, lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking dish and cook at 375oF for about an hour. (Cooking time varies 
according to the size of your bird.) That's it! Serve with some TJ's Old Fashioned Potato Salad [sku 32174], whip 
up a TJ's Organic Coleslaw Kit [sku 63491] and heat up some Organic Baked Beans [sku 37690], and you've got

"One of the many reasons we love the pre-marinated options in our fresh meat section is their utter simplicity 
of preparation. With all the chopping, slicing, and seasoning done for you, all that separates you from a juicy, 
flavorful, center-of-the-plate protein is a few minutes of grilling, roasting, or sautéeing. Take Trader Joe's Sun-
Dried Tomato & Basil Chicken Tenders, which are making their grand comeback to our refrigerators, for 
instance. Made with a base of boneless, skinless Chicken Breast tenders and a creamy, savory, Mediterranean-
style marinade, prepping this dish from scratch would normally be a labor-intensive endeavor. But since all the 
work is done for you, you're free to focus on the finer details, like what kind of side to serve alongside them-or 
what kind of wine...

Speaking of which, we find the tart and tangy notes of the Sun-Dried Tomato, along with the bright aromatics 
of the Basil, garlic, and onion make this is an ideal protein to pair with pasta, roasted veggies, and a dry, yet  
fruity, red wine. We find something like our Fior di Vino Chianti Classico [sku 62763] or our Rosa dell'Olmo 
Barbera d'Asti [sku 98304] make great companions. For something a little different, try pan-frying these 
Tenders and placing them in a sandwich with Pesto [sku 75825] and slices of Fresh Mozzarella [sku 77726].

"Among the common cuts of meat, chicken thighs might just make the most compelling canvas for seasonings, 
sauces, and marinades. Since chicken thighs have a relatively higher fat content, they're typically more juicy 
and flavorful from the start, which tends to create all the more exciting interactions with other flavors. Case in 
point: Trader Joe's Savory Herbed Chicken Thighs. Each package contains boneless, skinless cuts of Chicken 
Thigh that have been seasoned with a sublimely savory marinade that's made with aromatic herbs like basil, 
cilantro, and mint, along with garlic, shredded lemon peel, crushed chili peppers, and even a bit of fish sauce 
for an extra umami kick. 

This mix of bold herbs, seasonings, and aromatics, combined with the natural juiciness and richness of the 
Chicken Thighs, creates a uniquely delicious flavor profile once they're fully cooked. Speaking of which, since 
they're pre-marinated and ready to go, cooking is a breeze: simply grill, roast, or pan-fry until a thermometer 
in their internal temperature reads 165°F on a meat thermometer. After that, it's simply a matter of picking a 
side to serve them with: we like them with a bit of Organic Cauliflower Rice [sku 54241], some steamed veggies, 
or a fully-loaded baked potato, ourselves.

"Trader Joe's Brined Bone-In Chicken Breast is about three things: high-quality poultry, convenience, and 
great flavor!

First, the Chicken Breast in this package is All Natural-which officially means, it's minimally processed, with 
no artificial ingredients. And the chickens were raised on all-vegetarian feed, with no antibiotics ever, and no 
added hormones.

Second, we've gone ahead and Brined the Breast for you, with a seasoning mix that includes salt, sugar, white 
pepper, and garlic & onion powders. This step minimizes the prep work you need to do, while maximizing 
flavor potential. And speaking of flavor, with the Bone still intact, this Chicken Breast cooks up extra tender 
and juicy, complementing all the taste-benefits the brining brings. 

So, fire up your grill or oven and get ready for some of the best Chicken you've ever had. Just do it before 
summer runs out and this temporary item disappears until next year!

"We sell quite a lot of chicken. And the variety we offer abounds, from whole chickens to chicken wings, organic 
chicken to Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667], and organic chicken tenders to Pollo Asado [sku 81293]. 
And now, returning to fill out our assortment is Trader Joe's All Natural Cubed All White Meat Chicken.

Cubed Chicken, you ask? Yes, Cubed Chicken! While whole chicken breasts are great for a classic dish like 
Chicken Parmesan, these pieces of Chicken breast are pre-cut and ready to go for those meals where a whole 
breast isn't ideal. The cubes are small-about the size typically found in stir-fry or tossed in pasta. Our Cubed 
Chicken is boneless, skinless, all natural, and 100% antibiotic free (ABF).

One of the most exciting parts about our Cubed All White Meat Chicken is that it's out-of-the-package-ready 
for stir-frying, simmering, and sautéing. Simmer the pieces to perfection in Tikka Masala Curry Sauce [sku 
73062]. Marinate in Soyaki Sauce [sku 78555], sauté, and toss in a stir-fry. Or, sprinkle them with Cuban Style 
Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend [sku 65967] before cooking, then add to a homemade burrito bowl.

"Likely derived from a combination of the 16th century Irish term ""spitchcock"" (the practice of splitting an eel 
down the middle before roasting or frying it) and a punny reference to ""dispatching the cock"" (i.e., cooking 
a chicken rather quickly), we find that saying the word ""spatchcock"" is a lot more fun than the actual act of 
spatchcocking a chicken, itself. Which is precisely we we're such fans of our pre-marinaded, pre-butterflied, 
rarin'-and-ready-to-cook chicken, like our newest variation, Trader Joe's Spatchcocked Sweet & Savory 
Chicken. Made with an autumnally-inspired mix of sweet maple syrup and tangy Dijon mustard, our supplier 
has taken all the prep work out of this poultry, leaving you with just two simple tasks: Cook, and enjoy.

And since each Chicken comes pre-Spatchcocked (which is to say, split open at the breastbone and flattened), 
even the cooking process is much simpler, too. Just place it skin side up in a shallow baking pan and roast at 
350°F for 45-50 minutes for a perfectly evenly cooked, beautifully browned bird. Once cooked, the sweet and 
savory seasoning will caramelize wonderfully, making it a phenomenally flavorful center-of-the-plate option. 
Grab a few sides, like our Sweet Kale & Broccoli Slaw [sku 55386] and Country Potatoes with Haricots Verts & 
Mushrooms [sku 93984], and just like that, dinner is ready.

"Somewhere between ready-made meals and from-scratch feasts, there lies a middle ground. This space is for 
the busy person who doesn't have time to do all the prep work, but who doesn't want to relinquish the cooking

Breast and sliced it scallopini style, then submerged it in a traditional Pesto made with basil, Parmesan, pine 
nuts, parsley, pepper, garlic, and extra virgin olive oil. This gloriously green marinade not only infuses the 
Chicken with irresistibly herby flavor; it helps tenderize it, too.

Your part, should you choose to accept it: open the package and cook the contents. That's it. Pair the Pesto 
Chicken with a salad and some quinoa, rice, or Organic Striped Farfalline [sku 74547], and you've got dinner! 
Follow this simple plan, and despite your crazy schedule, you'll be crushing it-with just a little help from

Nutritionally appealing, yet still satisfyingly rich and beefy, it's especially ideal for forming lightly marbled 
patties for the grill. In the summer, try tossing in a lil' rosemary, salt, and pepper, or any of our savory seasoning 
blends for a wonderfully rich, yet nutritionally lean backyard-bash-of-a-burger. Once winter hits, Trader Joe's 
Extra Lean Ground Beef becomes the foundation for stews, chilies, or even a large pan of lasagna with a meat-
packed red sauce.

"Burger-meisters say that if you want to make a great burger, you should start with 80/20 ground beef. Of 
course, we recommend this one-pound package of Trader Joe's 80% lean, 20% fat Ground Beef from our 
refrigerators...

While you can surely find ground beef with different lean/fat ratios (we also sell 90/10 and 85/15), experts 
claim that 20% is just the right amount of fat for a moist, juicy burger. The fat renders (or melts down) as the 
burger cooks on your hot grill or in your skillet, ensuring you don't end up with a dry puck of a patty!

Our Ground Beef is sourced from a number of countries renowned for their excellent beef production, 
including Australia, New Zealand, and the United States-and it's processed and inspected in the U.S. to ensure 
only the best quality.

"When it comes to our customers' favorite recurring flavors, we're pleased to say that pickle remains a top pick. 
We proudly share this penchant for the pickle profile's alluringly herby aromatics and refreshing, briny tartness, 
so whenever the opportunity to bring in more pickle-powered products pops up, we pursue it. Our latest entry 
into the pickle pantheon, for instance, is Trader Joe's Dill-icious Seasoned Cold-Smoked Salmon. Taking a 
cue from the Scandinavian dish gravlax, this pleasantly-pickle-y Smoked Salmon is seasoned with our very 
own, decidedly dill-forward Seasoning in Pickle Seasoning Blend [sku 72778], giving every bite the tantalizingly 
tangy tinge of a classic, deli counter pickle. 

Delightfully tender in texture, and touched with a delicate smokiness that serves to complement the herbaceous 
quality of its Seasoning, our Dill-icious Smoked Salmon is an excellent choice for inclusion in tons of breakfast 
or brunch-adjacent dishes. Try it on a bagel with cream cheese (always a classic!), layered into a luxurious eggs 
Benedict, or diced and mixed into an egg scramble with plenty of chopped chives. And for later-in-the-day 
dining, we especially like it as the central protein in a pickle-y rice bowl for lunch, a beautifully briny smoked 
salmon dip as an hors d'eouvre, or the star of a delectably dill-y smoked salmon chowder for dinner.

"Often compared to cod and haddock, Hake is a flaky, mild-flavored white fish that can be found in all corners 
of the earth, with fisheries ranging from Uruguay, to Portugal, South Africa, and New Zealand. Trader Joe's 
Hake Fillets are wild caught for us in Chile's chilly Patagonia region, and arrive at our stores frozen and 
conveniently cut into boneless, skin-on fillets for ease of preparation. And since we've worked directly with our 
suppliers to secure the best price possible on this limited buy, that sense of ease is also extended to your wallet, 
too-at $4.99 per pound, these Fillets cost about half what you'd pay for comparable fish, anywhere else.

How best to prepare your Hake, you ask? By and large, any way you'd cook a piece of cod will work just as 
well for Hake. We recommend trying it baked with cherry tomatoes and Mediterranean veggies, grilled with 
a squeeze of lemon and dusting of Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend [sku 65967], or pan-fried with a 
crispy coating of well-seasoned Panko Breadcrumbs [sku 81614], for starters. Once prepared, we also heartily 
recommend pairing it with a chilled glass of something bright and refreshing, like our Belles Vignes Sauv Blanc 
[sku 58360].

"Trader Joe's All Natural Heirloom Whole Chicken is a very special chicken. First, it comes from a recognized 
breed with a genetic line that traces back multiple generations. And unlike so many other chickens raised very 
quickly on processed meal and antibiotics, these Heirloom Chickens are slow-growth, pasture-raised birds. 
This means they are allowed to mature at a natural rate and forage for food in a natural environment. They also 
have never been given antibiotics.

What's more, instead of using the common methods of water or ice chilling (which lead to water retention and 
muted flavor), our supplier air chills each Chicken, allowing them to retain their full flavor. The combination 
of all these positive attributes adds up to an extraordinarily delicious All Natural Whole Chicken, ideal for 
seasoning, brining, or stuffing, and roasting. In fact, we recommend roasting it with some potatoes, onions, 
and other veggies surrounding the Chicken, so that they get a chance to absorb some of those flavors via the 
pan drippings. Mmm!

our Heirlooms are slow-growth, pasture-raised birds, which means they are allowed to mature at a natural rate 
and forage for food in a natural environment. Additionally, instead of being water- or ice-chilled, (which can lead 
to water retention and muted flavor) our Heirloom Chickens are air-chilled. 

So, what do all these carefully complied-to practices and attributes add up to? Chicken Thighs that taste like 
chicken-the way chicken was always meant to taste, you might say. They're ideal for inclusion in all kinds of 
recipes. Try them sprinkled with Ranch Seasoning Blend [sku 72929], baked, and served over orzo pasta; dredged 
in flour, fried to a delectable golden brown, and drizzled with Organic Spicy Honey Sauce [sku 69094]; or roughly 
chopped and stir-fried with your favorite veggies, and simmered in Thai Yellow Curry Sauce [sku 78557].

"While we're always reluctant to elevate one species above any others, facts are facts: salmon seems to be our 
customers' favorite fish. And why shouldn't it be? It's rich, ""meaty,"" and generally mild; even non-fish-eaters

Now packaged in aseptic, vacuum-sealed packaging, Trader Joe's Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets are from 
salmon that have been carefully raised in some of the world's most pristine salmon farms, at the foot of the 
Atlantic Ocean in northern Norway. The salmon are raised with care by experienced fish farmers and never 
given antibiotics in their feed, which you'll find at some fish farms. Norway's frigid waters make for tender, 
buttery, and well-marbled salmon.

With bones and skin removed, Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets are especially ideal for non-grilling preparations, 
like roasting, baking, or poaching. They're great to have on hand for protein-and-omega-rich dinners in a 
hurry. Simply brush the fish with a bit of olive oil or butter, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, and cook as desired. 
Depending on how fancy you want to get here, dinner can be ready in as little as 15 minutes.

"Trader Joe's is committed to developing products with the very best attributes to satisfy all the desires of our 
Customers. Of course, this commitment includes our fresh meat selection! We now have several fresh sausage 
offerings that not only cook up juicy and full of flavor, but that also possess some very attractive characteristics 
when it comes to how the meat is raised and processed.

In the case of Trader Joe's Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage, for instance, our U.S. supplier uses chicken raised 
on all vegetarian feed, which have never been given antibiotics-ever. Aside from those estimable attributes, 
of course, they're also quite delicious: they're made in the style of a classic, Sweet Italian Sausage. Each link 
is seasoned with aromatic spices like mild anise and fennel seed, and contained in a natural pork casing to 
ensure a satisfyingly snappy texture once cooked through. They can be enjoyed simply on their own, as part of 
a delectably elevated hot dog, or incorporated into pasta dishes, sauces, soups, or even hearty breakfast hashes.  
For a true treat, try crumbling the contents of a Sausage or two into a pan and sautéeing before using as a prime 
pizza topping.

"A household name to some, but a peculiar protein replacement to many, tofu is a traditional piece of the 
culinary puzzle to many East Asian and Southeast Asian dishes. Tofu production was first recorded in China 
over two millennia ago and while we've only had our doors open since 1958, we like to think the Trader Joe's 
Organic Firm Tofu we produce has the quality of a tofu that's been being perfected over the last 2,000 years.  

Made from allowing soy milk to curdle, tofu can be packaged in a variety of softness: silken, soft, firm, and 
extra firm. Firm Tofu is most similar to the texture of all the raw meat and seafood we stock on our shelves, 
making it a popular meat alternative. Nutritionally, it has all nine essential amino acids, adding to that high 
profile meat alternative status Firm Tofu holds. Entirely plant-based, gluten free, high in protein while low in 
fat makes for a great addition to many dishes as the main protein component. Trader Joe's Organic Firm Tofu 
soaks up the flavor of any dish or sauce it gets tossed into, making for a flavorful and versatile plant-based star 
of many meals.

oven or battered and deep-fried. Best of all, we sell these Drumsticks in packages of about five, weighing 
somewhere in the neighborhood of a pound and a half, so you can get what you need for today, at a fantastic 
price, without being stuck with enough to feed the whole neighborhood.  And if you do want enough to feed 
the neighborhood?  We'll be happy to help you carry it all out to your car.

"We like to think of prosciutto as ham that's had time to luxuriate in a spa for a year. If you can imagine how 
much better you'd be after a year in a spa, you can begin to imagine how delightful prosciutto can be. Trader 
Joe's Sliced Prosciutto lives up to this promise.

Our Sliced Prosciutto is crafted for us by a well-known, award-winning Italian salumeri here in the U.S. They 
begin with full hams that are cured in the traditional Italian style, then allowed to age slowly for 10-12 months. 
As the hams age, their flavor intensifies and their character builds, resulting in richly-flavored Prosciutto that's 
outstanding on Panini with arugula & Asiago, a natural with melon for brunch or hors d'oeuvres and super on 
a pizza - try it with pesto or a cream-based sauce and inch-long cuts of asparagus. 

We're selling each four ounce package of Trader Joe's Sliced Prosciutto for $3.99, considerably less than you'll 
pay for comparable Prosciutto elsewhere.

"Yes, shawarma is typically cooked on a vertical spit (those rotisserie-like skewers that hold impressive amounts 
of meat). But the especially important part of shawarma is the delicious, savory spice blend that's used on meats 
cooked in this way. It's this crucial component that makes our new Trader Joe's Shawarma Chicken Thighs so 
wondrously good. 

Boneless, skinless chicken thighs are seasoned with a shawarma spice marinade made of onion, garlic, sea salt, 
cumin, cinnamon, coriander, paprika, turmeric, and parsley. Yes, we used almost the entire spice rack, but each 
one is vitally important, adding just the right amount of flavor to create glorious Shawarma Chicken Thighs.

Though it'd be handy, you do not need to have a vertical spit installed in your home to cook this Shawarma 
Chicken; a grill or an oven will do just fine. More than fine, actually. Grilling leaves you with perfectly charred 
chicken thighs, while baking results in tender, moist meat. Slice thin and serve with any number of Middle 
Eastern-inspired products: pita, hummus, Tzatziki [sku 20405], Tahini [sku 54978], Grecian Style Eggplant [sku 
53896], tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, olives, feta¿

Chicken Shawarma is, in its own right, fantastic, but it's even better when it's also a value. Each random weight 
package (1.5 pound average) of Trader Joe's Shawarma Chicken Thighs is $4.49 per pound, every day.

"""¿to sleep, perchance to dream - ay, there's the rub¿""-Hamlet

The ""rub"" to which Hamlet was referring didn't exactly involve bacon-but if it did, we think his dreams would 
have been the better for it. The truth is, there are plenty of delicious dishes out there that are made better with 
bacon. To put it simply, we're big fans of the stuff. So you can imagine our delight when our Buyer dreamed up 
a dry rubbed version to delight bacon enthusiasts everywhere.

Trader Joe's Uncured Sliced Bacon is Dry Rubbed by hand with spices, sea salt, raw sugar & celery powder, 
and slowly smoked for several hours over natural hardwoods, for deep, smoky flavor. It's made with pork raised 
on all-vegetarian feed, and no antibiotics ever, and there are no artificial ingredients, nitrates or nitrites added.

The proprietary Dry Rub process accomplishes two things that make this Bacon even more excellent than 
most, if we do say so ourselves: 1) the spiced rub imbues the bacon with a mouthwatering, smoky sweetness, 
and 2) because the rub does not contain added water (hence, ""dry""), it boasts less shrink and splatter during the 
cooking process-which ultimately means more bacon for you to enjoy. And enjoy it you will, with pancakes & 
eggs for breakfast, in BLTs for lunch, crumbled into cornbread with dinner¿

"Plant-based protein is all about having options: the option to make a dish that will satisfy meat-eaters and non 
meat-eaters alike, the option to engage in the occasional meatless Monday, the option to enjoy a juicy burger, 
regardless of protein preference-we really could go on. So we think it's only fitting that the scope of plant-
based protein itself should be brimming with options, too. In this spirit of plant-based pluralism, we're proud to 
introduce Trader Joe's Turkeyless Ground, a superbly savory protein that evokes the flavor, texture, and with 
21 grams per serving, protein content of ground turkey to seriously delicious degree.

Made from a meticulously measured blend of pea protein and textured wheat protein, our Turkeyless Ground 
is relatively light, lean, and holds onto spices, seasonings, and sauces with aplomb-just like regular ground 
turkey. That means it's a particularly smart choice for making dishes like tacos, chili, shepherd's pie, or spaghetti 
Bolognese. Since it cooks just like ground turkey, it can be used just like you would ground turkey, in stir fries, 
lasagnas, stuffed peppers, or hearty soups. And, of course, it also makes a spectacularly juicy burger, especially 
when seasoned with a bit of Mushroom & Company Umami Seasoning Blend [sku 63084].

"After 10 years as one of the MVPs of the TJ's cheese case, one might think that our Unexpected Cheddar's  [sku 
96923] ability to surprise would have waned, somewhat. Then Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar Chicken 
Sausage came along. Which isn't to say that it's necessarily shocking that cheese and chicken go well together, 
of course, but the degree to which this Parmesan-like Cheddar pairs with the flavor of savory-seasoned, lightly 
smoked chicken, sweet bits of caramelized onions and red pepper, and the satisfying snap of a natural pork 
casing? That's nothing short of astonishing.

Fully cooked and ready to reheat, Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar Chicken Sausages can be grilled, steamed, 
or pan-fried, and serve beautifully on a toasty, buttery bun-especially when adorned with Whole Grain Dijon 
Mustard [sku 99343] or Organic Sweet Pickle Relish [sku 69361]. They're also delicious when sliced into rounds, 
sautéed, and mixed into hearty soups, breakfast hashes, and creamy pastas dishes. And if you're feeling really 
spontaneous, or extra cheesy (or both), it's especially tasty when served hot with a sprinkling of melty Shredded 
Unexpected Cheddar [sku 65191] on top.

"Sure, chicken nuggets are often relegated to the ""kids menu."" But take another look, and you'll notice they're 
listed right alongside what are arguably some of the greatest culinary triumphs of the millenium, like mac n' 
cheese, hot dogs, and hamburgers, to name a few. So, bearing this in mind, allow Trader Joe's Organic Chicken 
Nuggets to offer an alternative approach: nuggets aren't just for kids... they're for the kid in all of us! Here, here.

We already offer some nice, nifty nuggets in our freezers, but when presented with an opportunity to carry 
them in this organic, fully-cooked, fresh-foods format, we leapt at the chance. Lightly breaded and made with 
organic chicken breast & rib meat, our Organic Chicken Nuggets crisp up beautifully in the oven or air-fryer, 
and if you find yourself the victim of a sudden snack attack, you can also microwave them on high and have hot 
Nuggets in under a minute! (You know what they say-a Nugget a day keeps your hunger at bay¿)

Our Organic Chicken Nuggets are, of course, great on their own, but to maximize your young-at-heart, nugget-
eating experience, we suggest serving them with a flight of your favorite dipping sauces, like TJ's Incredisauce 
[sku 73468], TJ's Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce [sku 27677], TJ's Organic Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce, TJ's 
Organic Ranch Dressing [56051], or TJ's Organic Ketchup [55860]. Here's looking at you, kid!

"While we hate to elevate one species above any others, facts are facts: salmon seems to be our customers' favorite 
fish. And why shouldn't it be? It's rich, ""meaty,"" and generally mild; even non-fish-eaters will sometimes make 
exceptions for salmon. Which we're, of course, thrilled about, because we love salmon, too. In fact, we love it so 
much, that we recently redesigned the packaging on several of our salmon SKUs so that the fish is that much 
fresher when it reaches your table.

Now packaged in aseptic, vacuum-sealed packaging, Trader Joe's BBQ Cut Fresh Atlantic Salmon fillets are 
from salmon that have been carefully raised in some of the world's most pristine salmon farms, at the foot of 
the Atlantic Ocean in northern Norway. The salmon are raised with care by experienced fish farmers and never 
given antibiotics in their feed, which you'll find at some fish farms. Norway's frigid waters make for tender, 
buttery, and well-marbled salmon-after all, fish need fat to keep warm!

Thanks to their extra thick, skin-on ""BBQ Cut,"" these Fresh Atlantic Salmon fillets can really take the heat 
and are ideal for grilling, pan-searing, roasting, baking, or poaching. They're great to have on hand for protein-
and-omega-rich dinners in a hurry. Simply brush the fish with a bit of olive oil or butter, sprinkle it with salt 
and pepper (or our Salmon Rub Seasoning Blend [sku 75289]) and cook as desired. Depending on how fancy 
you want to get here, dinner can be ready in as little as 15 minutes.

"Is Pork Belly the next bacon? Trick question. Pork Belly is basically bacon. It comes from the same part of the 
animal - the underside (belly) of a hog, after the loin and spareribs have been removed. Unlike bacon, though, 
the Pork Belly cut is considered fresh in that it is not smoked or cured. This variant makes a big culinary 
difference. Typically, raw Pork Belly requires hours and hours and hours of slow cooking. Who has the time, 
right? Not many, and that's why Bacon has been the talk of the belly, until¿ 

In recent years, Pork Belly has become ubiquitous on restaurant menus.  Exuding rich texture and taste, it 
stars in everything from salads and soups to buns and tacos. Working our way through many a popular Pork 
Belly serving, we pondered the possibility of making the preparation more manageable to the everyday chef. 
We started by looking at just how the restaurants were able to plate it with such ease. As it turns out, for the 
many restaurants, they purchase Pork Belly that is pre-cooked.  Well, hey - we can do that! We started by 
identifying a great supplier in the Midwest, the heart of the U.S. pork industry, with the capabilities to both 
cook and package the prime belly cut.  They take the ""chunks"" of Pork Belly, lightly season it with salt and 
braise it low-and-slow for 12 hours. Each piece is then cryovaced, so the succulent meat stays fresh and ready 
to get cooking. Then we bring you 12 ounce packages of quality Fully Cooked Pork Belly for the exceptional 
trading price of $4.99.

"Sometimes, you just want a hamburger. Fast-food is the quickest, easiest solution, but most people want more than just a 
good-tasting burger; they also want to know exactly what's in the meat (besides meat), and under what conditions it was 
prepared. Both of these questions aren't easily answered by just cruising through the drive-thru. As is so often the case, 
Trader Joe's offers a better solution for the quick-burger-fix: 80% Lean/20% Fat - Ground Beef Patties.

Though it doesn't take a star-studded Michelin chef to form ground beef into patties, it's definitely a time-saver to open up 
a fresh package of our all-Beef Patties and slap them directly on your grill or fry-pan. As for what goes in them, it's simple: 
100% Ground Beef that is 80% Lean and 20% Fat. We've discovered this is just the right ratio to produce a juicy, flavorful 
burger.

Each package is approximately one pound and contains four pre-formed Beef Patties (about four ounces each). Warm up 
a cast-iron frying pan over medium heat with a pad of butter in the center. When the butter melts, briefly toast four TJ's 
Honey Wheat Hamburger Buns [sku 30321] and set aside. Add more butter, and sprinkle your Patties with salt and pepper 
before placing in the hot pan-if there's no sizzle, turn up the heat! About three minutes per side should get you to about 
medium-rare. That's six minutes per burger, and about ten minutes total for a super-fast, family meal!

We've been selling Trader Joe's 80% Lean/20% Fat - Ground Beef Patties since the fall on the Coasts. Now, we're going 
national, making them available to the rest of the country for the same economical price of $4.99 per pound.

"Jalapeño. Sausage. Chicken. Spicy. Rearrange those words, put them together, and you get Trader Joe's Spicy 
Jalapeño Chicken Sausage, a singular sausage with the fiery bite of jalapeño peppers in every mouthful.  

We know that spicy sausages are nothing new. What you'd find in most stores, when looking for spicy sausages, 
are spicy Italian sausages. We have those, too. But look closely at our sausage section (we have such a thing), 
though, and you'll find an array of spicy choices that go beyond the usual suspects. Choices like TJ's Spicy Ja-
lapeño Chicken Sausage, which employ medium-hot jalapeño peppers, rather than the typical Italian season-
ings, to produce the heat. They're lower in fat and calories than traditional pork sausage-each link has a mere 
100 calories with only six grams of fat! They're produced without the use of added nitrites, nitrates or MSG; and 
they're fully cooked, so all you need to do is heat 'em and eat 'em-on the grill or stovetop, under the broiler, 
or even in the microwave. Try one on a bun, the traditional way, or slice them into chunks and add them to 
enchiladas or even omelets. 

Trader Joe's Spicy Jalapeño Chicken Sausage is $3.99 for each 12-ounce package of five sausages-that's about 
80¢ a link, a great deal for this spicy, juicy treat. And remember, this is no sale price. This has been our price

"Want a hot tip? Or rather, hot Tips? Here's what you do: Go to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and pick up a 
package of Balsamic Rosemary Beef Steak Tips. Heat your grill to medium-high, then open the package and 
empty the chunks of choice beef (cut from the upper two-thirds portion of the bottom sirloin) onto a large 
plate or tray and lightly spray the meat with Avocado Oil Spray [sku 70738]. Then, simply grill the meat 7 to 8 
minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F. Pull it off the grill and let it rest it for a few minutes 
before serving.

The tasty result is tender, sweet and savory Steak Tips, owing their flavor to the Balsamic vinegar and Rosemary 
marinade with which they were prepared-ahead of time, by us! Here's another tip: if you'd rather not use the 
barbecue, these Beef Steak Tips are just as sweet and savory (and simple) when cooked in a stovetop skillet, 
or broiled in your oven.

"We've been looking to develop some convenient seafood meal solutions to add to our freezers. Knowing how 
much our customers love Trader Joe's Wild Uncooked Argentinian Red Shrimp [sku 71696], we decided to start 
there, then spice it up-quite literally! These Red Shrimp are wild caught in the icy cold waters off the coast of 
Argentina. This variety is red even before it's cooked and known for its lobster-like qualities-such as a sweet-
sea taste, and a meaty texture.

We add ginger-garlic butter that has a hint of honey, along with some spiciness from chili flakes and cayenne. 
Then we bump the heat up another notch with a Togarashi Style Seasoning. In Japanese, Togarashi literally 
refers to the genus Capsicum, including bell peppers, jalapenos, etc. Our particular blend has a chili powder 
base with orange peel, black & white sesame seeds, poppy seeds, szechuan pepper, and nori seaweed. Zesty!

After thawing in the refrigerator, these flavorful Argentinian Red Shrimp cook in minutes on the stovetop or 
in a conventional oven. Make it a full meal with a side of Vegetable Fried Rice [sku 52148] and dinner is done!

"Are you a seeking the secret to sensationally moist and juicy Chicken? Search no further, your quest is 
complete-it's Buttermilk! This cultured dairy product makes a magnificent marinade, as the acidity in the 
Buttermilk will tenderize the chicken, allowing it to retain more of its juices when cooking. But this marinade's 
magic isn't instantaneous-it's best to let the Chicken marinate for an extended period of time to thoroughly 
season the chicken outside-in. 

What about dinner tonight, you ask? Perhaps, your taste buds have been tantalized by the sound of such 
terrifically tender Chicken that your mouth is watering now. Well, you're in luck-the wizards behind Trader 
Joe's Buttermilk Brined Half Chicken make that dinner-tonight dream a reality. This Chicken comes already 
marinated in a brine of Buttermilk, salt, vinegar powder, and rosemary extract and is ready to be cooked 
straight from the package. Terrific for serving two people, this Half Chicken is our first offering of this size-
try roasting in the oven with potatoes, or on the grill, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Serve 
alongside our Broccoli & Kale Slaw [sku 55386] with a glass of Organic Tea & Lemonade [sku 86923] for your

"While we thoroughly enjoy a gyro out, there are definitely times we just want to gyro in-cozying up with the 
richly seasoned strips of beef or lamb, enfolded in a flatbread with tomatoes, red onions, and a seductive dollop 
of creamy, cucumber-y tzatziki-mmm. Our obstacle: cooking gyro (say: ""YEE-ro"") meat is no joke.  

Just consider the presumed roots of this dish, back to the time of Alexander the Great, when soldiers used their 
long swords to skewer meat, which they arduously rotated over open fires. Cooking methods may have modern-
ized (a bit), but bottom line-it's an intense process. Luckily, we are in the business of banishing barriers to truly 
tender, savory meat. Enter: Trader Joe's Gyro Slices. 

Traveling to Chicago-a hotbed of gyro production-we sought out masters of this Mediterranean-style meat. 
The midwest meat mavins we found, expertly season their fusion of ground beef, breadcrumbs, and lamb, with 
garlic, oregano, and lemon. Then, they rotate and roast it until it yields. Lastly, they slice it thin, as though on a 
swords edge, so the meat remains supple, with edges that crisp when heated. 

Our Fully Cooked Gyro Slices come ready to heat and dish. While the flatbread wrap is a natural fit (traditional

"Trader Joe's Organic 3 Grain Tempeh is not only the best value in town (at $1.99* for each half-pound 
package, how couldn't it be?), but it's some of the best tasting tempeh you're going to find! While you're probably 
familiar with tofu and its plant-based benefits, its time to honor their lesser known sibling, tempeh, and all of 
its nutritional and flavorful benefits.

Long before plant-based burgers and pastas, the original meat alternatives were primarily comprised of 
soybeans. Made from soybeans, brown rice, barley, and millet, our Organic 3 Grain Tempeh is a nutritional 
powerhouse full of fibrous grains and plant-based protein. Basically, we take the aforementioned ingredients, 
partially cook them, then inoculate the mixture with a culture that ferments the blend. This fermenting process 
is what both gives the tempeh its firm, cake-like appearance and its umami, meaty flavors. Following this, the 
live cultures are cooked off resulting in the fully cooked block of Organic 3 Grain Tempeh you find in our 
stores!

"Bratwurst is enjoyed, especially, during Oktoberfest-a German celebration that begins in September. That's why 
we're introducing Trader Joe's Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst in August. Makes total sense!

Such premature fanfare does have a pivotal purpose; and that's to make sure you are well aware of this new 
sensational sausage before the kick-off of Oktoberfest (and whichever other fall fests you plan to commemorate 
with sausages).

Our Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst is modeled after the most traditional sausages served at the Oktoberfest in 
Munich. In fact, it's made for us in Germany of pork sausage, well-seasoned with spices like marjoram, black 
pepper, nutmeg, mace, ginger, coriander, and pimento. Like the best of the sausages served at such German 
celebrations, ours is made without added nitrates or nitrites. This means it won't last for months in your fridge, 
but these fully-cooked links will taste incredibly fresh when you serve them. 

If you want to go full-on traditional, serve these sausages with mashed potatoes or sauerkraut, or both! And yes, 
a stein of your favorite beer-Märzen is the most common, but any lager will complement these Brats. We're 
selling each 12 ounce package of four links for $3.99. You'll find them in our refrigerated case.

"Ground beef is so passé. Okay, maybe not so passé-cheeseburgers will never go out of style. But ground beef 
isn't the only player now, at least on the shelves of Trader Joe's. We also sell Ground Turkey [sku 16574], and now 
we're adding yet another choice to our offering: All Natural Ground Chicken.

Our All Natural Ground Chicken offers an excellent and exciting new option when shopping for ground 
meat-yes, we think Ground Chicken is exciting. Especially ours, which is gluten free, antibiotic free, and from 
chickens fed all-vegetarian diets. The meat, a blend of white and dark meat, is 92% lean and 8% fat, giving it a 
mild flavor and moist profile. 

Another hallmark of our All Natural Ground Chicken? Its versatility is unmatched. Form it into patties and 
serve with all the classic burger fixings. Cook up a pot of chicken chili. Use it as the key ingredient for casseroles, 
pot pies, meatballs, meatloaf, lettuce wraps, tacos, pasta sauces, chicken stuffed peppers¿ Okay, you get the 
idea. When we say versatile, we do mean versatile. 

We're selling each one-pound package of Trader Joe's All Natural Ground Chicken for just $3.49. We love you, 
cheeseburgers, but we also love choices. Like ground chicken.

"So many meat preparations major on the savory-salty side. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that! However, 
there are times when something a little sweeter hits the meat spot. Trader Joe's Sesame Teriyaki Beef Skirt 
Steak delivers, when that's what you're craving.

Inside the package is a cut of USDA Choice Angus beef that becomes very tender when cooked. It's marinating 
in a Sesame Teriyaki sauce, which includes soy sauce, honey, and sesame seeds. The flavor will appeal to those 
who love the sweet, soy & sesame flavor of classic teriyaki. 

Grill it over high heat to create a coveted char. Or slice it thinly and stir fry on the stovetop with your favorite 
veggies. Either way, Trader Joe's Sesame Teriyaki Beef Skirt Steak will become a new favorite, not only for its 
flavor profile, but also for its ease of preparation.

"Trader Joe's Uncured Apple Smoked Bacon is made without added sodium nitrite or sodium nitrate, two 
ingredients commonly used in the curing of bacon. This means that our Uncured Apple Smoked Bacon is 
technically ""uncured."" Rather than use chemical curing agents, ours is smoked over real applewood, giving it 
a distinctive, delicious, downright decadent flavor. However, our recipe includes sea salt and celery powder, 
which contain naturally occurring nitrites. 

This is thickly sliced bacon that's appropriate with eggs for breakfast, with lettuce and tomatoes for a BLT, 
in wraps, on salads... You can cook it as you'd cook any bacon, though our current favorite cooking method 
involves cooking on a foil-lined baking sheet in a 400° oven for about 15 minutes - this nets the most delicious 
result. (We suggest you place it in a cold oven and let it cook while the oven heats; exact timing will vary, so 
stay close in the final few minutes to avoid burning.)

"Trader Joe's Organic 85/15 Ground Beef comes from organically raised cattle that are never given antibiotics 
or artificial growth hormones. The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures-their diet of 
natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that's rich in healthful Omega-3 
fatty acids. 

Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional 
methods. If you've ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is 
why-it requires more space, more time, and more labor. At Trader Joe's, we work diligently to ensure that 
though the price may be higher, it represents excellent value. With that in mind, our Organic Grass Fed 
Ground Beef is $6.99 for a one pound package, which is a terrific value for organic, grass fed ground beef, a 
price that's 50¢-a-pound less than our price last year.

85/15 refers to the ratio of lean to fat, meaning that this Organic Ground Beef is 85% lean. We've found that 
this ratio makes brilliant burgers; so when the urge strikes to fire up that grill, make this your go-to Ground 
Beef.

"When it comes to value, we don't mess around here at Trader Joe's. So, when we get the opportunity to offer 
an even better value on items we've carried for awhile, we jump on it. Though Trader Joe's Organic Chicken 
Breasts aren't new to our shelves, the price is-and it'll impress.

Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Breasts come from chickens raised specifically for us primarily on family farms, 
under the strict USDA guidelines for Organic Certification. In accordance with these guidelines, the chickens 
are fed a vegetarian diet of only a certified organic corn and organic soybean meal, and they are never given 
antibiotics or fed animal fats or by-products.

Because these Breasts are boneless and skinless, they're low in fat, super convenient, and very versatile. Grill 
or pan-fry them to use in salads. Dust them with seasoned flour and ""oven fry"" for a quick & healthier take 
on fried chicken. Include them in soups and stir-frys, make Chicken Parmesan, use them in casseroles, make 
tacos, cook up some chicken chili or skewer some kebabs. Talk about adaptable!

"Whether or not you believe that ""breakfast is the most important meal of the day,"" at least we can all agree that 
the traditional morning mix of savory (eggs, bacon, buttered toast), and sweet (pastries, jams, fruit) makes 
breakfast the best meal of the day. And, who hasn't sneakily inched their breakfast sausages nearer to the pancake 
stack, anticipating that unorthodox-yet technically non-taboo-taste of sausage, doused in syrup? Being big 
fans of breakfast (and of such classically contrasting flavors) ourselves, we're adding Maple Chicken Breakfast 
Sausages to our list of cockcrow offerings-an irresistible item that delivers savory and sweet in every single 
bite. 

These all-natural, minimally processed sausages have no casings, and no hormones or antibiotics added. 
They come fully cooked and ready to heat. A quick pan-fry or broil brings to life savory tastes (salt, paprika, 
spices), and sweet flavors (maple syrup, brown sugar, caramelized sugar). It's a profile that pairs well with 
eggs of any style. Halved and layered on an English Muffin [sku 90558] with cheddar and eggs, these Maple 
Chicken Sausages make for a delectible breakfast sandwich. Diced and combined in a flour tortilla with eggs, 
Black Beans [09636], and cheese, these dulcet sausages call for a dose of your favorite piquant sauce [like, TJ's 
Double-Roasted Salsa, sku 57059].

However they're prepared, Trader Joe's Maple Chicken Sausages provide an excellent excuse to serve 
breakfast at any hour of the day! Our twelve-ounce package of 12 links is $4.49, and can be found in our 
refrigerated deli section.

"It may seem far outside the ordinary, implausible, even, but plant-based burgers have become one of the most 
popular food trends of the past few years, and there's no sign of slowing down. Folks are increasingly going 
for meatless burgers for all kinds of reasons, but we like to think that one reason in particular is primarily 
responsible: plant-based burgers have gotten really, really good recently. That's why we decided to bring in our 
very own Trader Joe's Protein Patties, a pair of pea protein-based, quarter-pound burger Patties that offer 
the flavor and texture of a traditional beef hamburger, but with none of the meat - or any other animal-based 
ingredients, for that matter.

Throw these Protein Patties on the grill or in a hot skillet, and they'll sizzle and brown, just like a traditional 
burger. Serve them warm on a toasty bun and take a bite, and you'll experience their satisfyingly savory flavor 
and marvellously meaty texture, just like in a traditional burger. Why, thanks to the crafty inclusion of beets 
in the ingredient deck, they'll even stay soft and pink in the middle - just like a traditional burger. Unlike 
a traditional burger, though, Trader Joe's Protein Patties are totally vegan - but that doesn't stop them from 
supplying a whopping 18 grams of protein per patty. Implausible as they may seem, Trader Joe's Protein 
Patties  are here, and our veggie burger game will never be the same. Keep an eye out for each eight-ounce 
package in our refrigerators.

"Wild caught in the icy cold waters off the southern coast of Argentina, in a region known as Patagonia, our 
Wild Caught Uncooked Argentinian Red Shrimp are, well - quite the catch.  They are well known for their 
red hue (when raw and cooked), their quick cooking (nearly half the time as other shrimp), and their lobster-
like qualities (sweet-sea taste, and meaty texture). 

Already peeled and deveined, these Uncooked Argentinian Red Shrimp are ready to get cooking.  They are 
great to create a classic scampi, stir fry, jambalaya, lettuce wrap, enchilada, citrus & avocado salad... In other 
words, our Wild Caught Uncooked Argentinian Red Shrimp are a home freezer mainstay. Find them in our 
freezers.

"There's just something about perfectly-seasoned, tender, smoked salmon that always keeps us coming back for 
more. Don't get us wrong, we love smoked salmon of all kinds, but every now and then, specially-seasoned 
sensations like our Pastrami Style Smoked Atlantic Salmon [sku 53848] or our gravlax-inspired holiday sets just 
give us something extra. That's why, when we decided to bring in another smoked salmon, we knew we didn't 
want to season it with just anything. Instead, we chose to use everything - but the bagel, that is. Say hello to a 
little something we call Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon!

Made using the same mix of spices as our best-selling Everything But The Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 
59137], Everything But the Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon takes the classic combination of smoked salmon 
and a fully-loaded ""everything"" bagel, and rolls it into one delicious, brunch-ready treat - minus the actual 
bagel, of course. Each slice of delicately smoked Atlantic salmon is given a generous dusting of crunchy dried 
garlic and onion, flavorful poppy seeds, and a mix of delightfully nutty black and white sesame seeds. This 
combo of savory & smoky, soft & crunchy makes it an elevated alternative for any typical smoked salmon 
application, be it in hors d'oeuvres, eggs benedict, salads, or your standard brunch spread. Why, you can even 
top a freshly toasted, cream cheese-covered ""everything"" bagel with a slice or two - because who doesn't want 
a little more of everything?

We're selling each 4-ounce package of Everything But The Bagel Seasoned Smoked Salmon for $5.49 - in the 
world of smoked salmon, that's nothing short of a spectacular value. You'll find them in our deli case.

"The holidays present a great excuse to splurge on special foods that may not show up on your typical weekly 
menu. Our Porcini Boneless Beef Loin Roast is one of those products that definitely provides special holiday 
vibes. This Beef Roast is a cut from the short loin, the same part of the cow that provides premium cuts like 
T-bones and porterhouse steaks. And it's USDA Choice Angus Beef-the same quality grade you'll find in our 
Trader Joe's Premium Angus Steak program. 

Generally speaking, this extrordinarily tender cut is best presented with a bit of a seasoning boost, the way filet 
mignon is often complemented by a rich sauce. Here, our Boneless Roast has been rubbed with a seasoning 
blend that includes Porcini mushrooms, salt, minced garlic, onion powder, red bell peppers, parsley flakes, and 
chili peppers.

All this prep (which we've happily done for you!) complements the Beef Loin's tenderness with a deep, nutty 
flavor that makes putting this Roast on the table a special event, indeed. You need only pop it in a 375°F oven 
for about an hour, then let it rest about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

"We may be known for our All Natural, Brined, Fresh Young Turkeys [skus 90351, 98489, & 95290], but we're 
not afraid to ham it up from time to time. Case in point: Have you tried Trader Joe's Spiral Sliced, Uncured 
Hams? They're an excellent alternative to turkey or beef, whether its the Easter season or the winter holidays. 

Our hams are 100% antibiotic-free, and come only from vegetarian-fed pigs that have never received 
hormones. What's more, our uncured hams have no added nitrates or nitrites-except what's naturally present 
in celery and sea salt. Our own preparation process (a ""curing"" of sorts) yields a more artisanal product that 
boasts exceptional flavor. 

When it comes to serving it up, each of our hams is conveniently spiral-sliced. This allows the meat to stay 
connected to the bone until it's gently removed with the twist of a fork. Each ham comes fully cooked, and 
requires only a gentle warming at 275ºF for 12 to 15 minutes per pound. This translates to just over one hour 
for our quarter hams (4 to 4.5 pounds each) and around 2 hours for our half hams (8 to 9 pounds each). 

And, don't forget the finishing touch! Our molasses-based glaze comes in a packet, ready to be dissolved over 
medium heat in a small saucepan with one-eighth cup of water. Baste the cooled glaze on your heated ham, 
and you'll have a holiday hit on your hands! Trader Joe's Spiral Sliced, Uncured Hams are a true value at 
$4.99 per pound. They are seasonally available, March through April and November through December.

"""At the time I write, the glory of the truffle has now reached its culmination...In fine, the truffle is the very diamond of 
gastronomy.""  -Jean Antheleme Brillat-Savarin, The Physiology of Taste (1825)

It would seam that Brillat-Savarin spoke too soon. It's 2014 and ""the very diamond of gastronomy"" is still 
top-of-palate. The prevailing allure of truffles inspired us to put forth this heady wonder-Trader Joe's Truffle 
Salami-exclusively for the holiday season. 

It all starts in the beautiful Italian region of Umbria, where truffle hunters roam the hills with their trained 
dogs, who sniff out these lumpy mushrooms when they're ripe, one at a time, as they have for centuries. The 
black summer truffles (or tartufi in Italian) are harvested May through September. 

Working with one of Italy's oldest family-owned salumeria, who now has manufacturing capabilities in both 
Italy and California; we marry these gastronomic gems with all pork salami.  Overseen by an esteemed salumi-
ere from Como, Italy, the pork is seasoned simply with salt, pepper and garlic, and then infused with the black 
summer truffles. Stuffed into casing, the Truffle Salami is air dried in a delicate process that takes 3-4 weeks.  
The result is firm, deep ruby-hued salami with an unforgettable bite: it's rich and salty, a tiny bit sweet, with 
earthy notes of garlic and chocolate, imparted by the truffles. Some might audibly groan. Some might do a 
little dance. Others might relish in silence. It's glorious.

Slice thin on the bias and paired with your favorite cheese and glass of  TJ's Grand Reserve Rutherford Caber-
net. It's also amazing chopped or slivered and added to a favorite pasta or risotto dish. Many a mouth will wa-

"""Dispatch the cock!"" One might alternatively say, ""Expedite the chicken!"" The theory goes that some hungry 
Irishman came up with this poultry preparation method that involves the splitting and flattening of a chicken, 
thus accelerating the rate of cooking, since more of surface area is in touch with the grill or other cooking sur-
face. In short, cooking time is shortened, and the done bird is moister (breasts don't overcook while the rest of 
the bird finishes), with lots of nice, evenly crisp skin.

While Spatchcocking isn't necessarily brain surgery, it does take some extra work in the kitchen, which some 
feel negates the time you save actually cooking the bird. Trader Joe's negates this negation by providing a fully 
Spatchcocked Chicken, ready to grill or roast. Not only is it already 'butterflied' for you, it is also pre-seasoned; 
soaked in a brine with orange and lime juices, and marinated in extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, garlic, rosemary, 
parsley, and lemon slices.

Remove Trader Joe's Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken from its package (leave the lemon slices in 
tact and don't rinse it), and put it on a pre-heated grill skin-side down until it's well-browned and its internal 
temperature reaches 165ºF on a meat thermometer. Alternately, you can lay it skin-side up in a shallow baking 
pan and cook at 375ºF in your oven for about an hour. (Cooking time varies according to the size of your bird.)

We've enthusiastically dispatched two-and-a-half to three-pound Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chickens 
to all our Trader Joe's locations, where you can snatch your own for $3.99 per pound. (That puts a three pound, 
ready-to-cook Chicken at under $12.00.) Only at Joe's.

"It's party time! Of course, we have desserts more than covered when it comes to your fall & winter get-togethers-
but what about what comes before dessert? Trader Joe's Spicy Uncured Charcuterie Selection makes an ideal 
centerpiece for that special sandwich station, and can make your antipasto platter into something spectacular.

The Charcuterie Selection includes three, traditional Italian meats-all with a spicy profile. First, there's the 
Spicy Coppa, consisting of pork shoulder that is fermented & dried 90 days and seasoned with sea salt, sugar, 
red pepper, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg & cloves. Second, there's the Spicy Sopressa. It's premium 
pork butt (thicker part of the pork shoulder), fermented & dried 60 days and seasoned with sea salt, sugar, red 
pepper, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper & white pepper. Third is the Spicy Cooked Capocolla, which is 
cooked, then fermented & dried 15 days. It also has a ""hot"" profile, with seasonings that include sea salt, sugar, 
paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, nutmeg & cloves.

All three of these high-quality cuts are Uncured, meaning that no nitrates or nitrites have been added, except 
those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt. Create an irresistible spread with your own artful 
arrangement of these meats, complimented by a couple milder cuts, like Trader Joe's The Original Mortadella 
[SKU 53521], and our Uncured Salame di Parma [SKU 58940].

We're selling the 9-ounce package of Trader Joe's Spicy Uncured Charcuterie Selection for $7.99. Find it in 
our refrigerators, but only for the fall/winter season.

"Drumrolls announce exciting events or occurrences, and drumsticks are used to create this commotion. Trader 
Joe's Organic Chicken Drumsticks are not the type of drumsticks you use for a drumroll, but thanks to their 
many attributes and excellent value, they are worthy of one.

Our Organic Drumsticks come from chickens raised specifically for us in the United States, under the strict 
USDA guidelines for Organic Certification. In accordance with these guidelines, the chickens are fed a vegetar-
ian diet, and they are never given hormones or antibiotics-ever. 

These Drumsticks contain both bones and skin, and the dark meat, when cooked, is juicy and flavorful. They're 
also incredibly easy to prepare: choose your favorite sauce, your preferred cooking method, and have at it. Pair 
with Organic Sriracha and Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce [sku 53799], General Tsao Sauce [sku 57473], or Soyaki 
Sauce [sku 78555]. Then grill, bake, or fry. The options are nearly endless, but there's no wrong way to go. 

We're selling Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Drumsticks for $1.99 per pound, every single day. That's an excel-

"Though we're very proud of what we offer in our stores, we believe there's always room to improve. We listen 
to customer feedback and spend lots of time assessing (and re-assessing!) the quality of our products through 
regular tastings. And even when there's no beef about it, it's not rare for us to designate an item for further de-
velopment. 

Speaking of rare beefs, we've taken a recent opportunity to improve all of the Steak we stock in our fresh meat 
case. With our focus on taste, quality, and consistency-we've updated the variety of grades and specific cuts we 
offer. We now provide nine Steaks (reduced from thirteen), presented in three tiers: Ungraded Steaks, Choice 
Grade Steaks, and All Natural No Antibiotics Ever Choice Grade Steaks. 

Trader Joe's Choice Premium Angus Beef Flank Steak is one of four cuts we offer on the Choice Grade tier-
the grade just below USDA Prime (usually found only in fine restaurants). Flank Steak comes from the well-
exercised abdominal part of the hindquarter. That means this longer, thinner cut has a fair amount of connective 
tissue, which makes it perfect for London Broil, where marinating contributes to a more tender Steak. This cut 
is also very popular for fajitas and for Asian stir-fry dishes. 

However you choose to enjoy it, we know you'll find the quality of Trader Joe's Choice Premium Angus Beef 
Flank Steak hard to beat-especially at our price of $10.99 per pound ($9.99 in Texas).

"While most often associated with the Cajun cuisine of Louisiana, Andouille sausage is said to have originated 
in France or Germany - the name is definitely of French origin, but the traditional recipe is quite similar to 
other longstanding German sausage varieties. Whatever its origins, though, Andouille sausage is always made 
with pork. Well, okay, maybe not always.

Trader Joe's All Natural Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage is, as its name suggests, made with chicken. 
Skinless fresh (never frozen) chicken. The chicken is chopped and seasoned with flavorful additions like 
crushed red pepper, black pepper, paprika, and garlic, then stuffed into natural pork casings and smoked to 
achieve the ideal balance of spicy and savory. Most sausages you'll find elsewhere are preserved with added 
nitrites or nitrates. Not Trader Joe's All Natural Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausages. These have no artificial 
preservatives, no MSG, and they're gluten free. What do they have? Big, bold, fresh flavors, the convenience of 
being fully cooked, and the versatility to be at home anywhere, from Jambalaya to a toasted bun.

You'll find All Natural Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausages in 12.8 ounce packages of four in the refrigerated 
cases at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"Sometimes, to get the best results, you've got do something by hand - even, perhaps especially, in cases where 
you might not expect it. To fill each bag of Trader Joe's Peruvian Bay Scallops, for example, our supplier 
employs the use of divers, who delve into the clear blue waters of Peru's coastal bays to hand collect scallops 
from the ocean floor. This approach not only prevents by-catch and perpetuates a more sustainable method of 
harvest, but ensures that only the highest-quality Scallops are selected, and ultimately, reach your plate.

It's a difference that you can taste immediately: these Peruvian Bay Scallops have a mild, elegantly buttery 
flavor and, when cooked to the right doneness, have a firm, springy texture that plays particuarly well against 
pastas and citrusy sauces. Smaller in size than a standard sea scallop, Bay Scallops take only a few minutes 
to cook and are a natural fit for including in stews, topping salads, or even giving a light dredging in flour 
and sauteeing until just crispy. Overall, they're a remarkably handy seafood option to keep in your freezer - 
perhaps it's not so surprising they were collected by hand, after all.

"Branzino (aka European Sea Bass) is a popular fish in Italy and other Mediterranean countries, in part, because 
it is so plentiful in the Mediterranean Sea. But its popularity may be due, even more so, to its character as a 
light, flaky, and sweet, white fish.

Trader Joe's Branzino Fillets make European Sea Bass easily accessible. Our Fillets are farm-raised in 
Turkey-a method that helps prevent over-fishing of this popular progeny of Poseidon. Our one-pound freezer 
pack contains four fillets that have been deboned-a convenient format you're not likely to find elsewhere. The 
skin, however, is left on because this fish is traditionally prepared whole. With the application of olive oil and 
proper cooking, the delicate skin becomes pleasantly crisp; a nice contrast to the flaky fish.

Speaking of prep, you can either thaw these Branzino Fillets overnight in the fridge, or more quickly in a 
sealed bag placed in a bowl of cold water on the counter for 30 minutes. Once thawed, you have numerous 
cooking options, including: baking, broiling, grilling (wrapped in foil), or pan frying. Detailed directions are 
on the package.

"Trader Joe's Organic 85/15 Ground Beef Patties come from organically raised cattle that are never given 
antibiotics or artificial growth hormones. The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures - their 
diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that's rich in healthful 
Omega-3 fatty acids. 

Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional 
methods. If you've ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is 
why - it requires more space, more time, and more labor. At Trader Joe's, we work diligently to ensure that 
though the price may be higher, it still represents excellent value. With that in mind, our Organic Grass Fed 
Ground Beef Patties are $6.99 for a one pound package of four pre-portioned Patties - if you've shopped for 
similar products elsewhere, you'll know this is a stellar value. 

85/15 refers to the ratio of lean-to-fat, meaning that this Organic Ground Beef is 85% lean. 85% lean and 15% 
fat means brilliant, juicy burgers, every time. So when the urge strikes to fire up that grill, make these Organic 
Patties your go-to ground beef option.",81946,,1 Lb,,Organic Ground Beef Patties 85/15,8.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-ground-beef-patties-85/15-081946,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Organic Ground Beef Patties 85/15"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":8,""name"":""Food"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":122,""name"":""Meat, Seafood & Plant-based"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":125,""name"":""Beef, Pork & Lamb"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Organic Ground Beef Patties 85/15\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20801/81946.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":1,""sales_uom_description"":""Lb"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":8.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Fire Up The Grill""],""item_characteristics"":[""Antibiotic Free"",""Grass Fed"",""Organic""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"Ahhh, summer. The days are long, the sun is out, the grill is fired up¿and now you'll have Trader Joe's All 
Natural Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs to throw onto that fired-up grill!

Our new Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs just might be the ultimate choice for summertime cooking. 
Sourced from family-owned farms where the chickens are fed a 100% vegetarian diet and never given antibiot-
ics or growth hormones, these Thighs are all but ready to throw on the grill. Thigh meat is incredibly flavorful, 
and it's even more so when the bone and skin are left intact. 

A little seasoning (salt & pepper, TJ's Seasoning Salt [sku 59138], maybe a shake of 21 Seasoning Salute [sku 
07344]?), a marinade like our Soyaki [sku 78555], or a basting of Organic Sriracha & Roasted Garlic Barbecue 
Sauce [sku 53799] will go a long way with this particular piece of chicken. Once you've done your desired prep, 
those Thighs are ready for the grill! You can also bake 'em in the oven for an equally juicy, flavorful entrée. (You 
can even crisp the skin on the stove top for about 10 minutes before baking-and you will want to do this.)

We're selling each random-weight package of All Natural Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs for $1.99 per 
pound. That's an outstanding value for this summer-friendly product that you'll surely want to become friendly 
with this summer. You'll find it in our fresh meat case, but only during these summer months.

"At Trader Joe's, we're somewhat known for our diverse, flavorful assortment of fully-cooked sausages. From 
Chicken Jalapeño [sku 28285] to Bavarian Bratwurst [sku 57632], we've got quite the assortment, but we did 
notice an area of oversight: Organic. Trader Joe's Organic Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage is here to fill that 
void with flavor and style.  

These Sausages are made with ground chicken, sweet Italian seasoning, basil, garlic, and celery powder. The 
mixture is stuffed by hand into natural casing and hung on racks, where it cooks at a low temperature for a long 
period of time. After cooking to perfection, the casing is removed and the sweet-smoky sausages are ready to 
enjoy.

With its fairly versatile profile, our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage is prepared to complement any and every 
meal you have in mind-all you'll have to do is heat and serve. Add it to Spinach Tortellini [sku 95231] and 
Marinara Sauce [sku 01628] for a quick yet impressive Italian meal. Grill and serve on a bun with your favorite 
condiments, use to stuff squash or mushrooms, or slice and cook in a skillet with potatoes, peppers, and onions.

Despite its ""organic"" attribute, you'll still find Trader Joe's Organic Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage at a Trader 
Joe's value. We're selling each 12-ounce package of five sausages for $5.99, every day.

"We love deli meat. Whether we're putting it between bread and calling it a sandwich, pairing it with sliced 
cheeses on a platter, or simply enjoying a slice as a lean-protein-laden snack, it brings smiles to our faces.  For 
even happier faces, we choose deli meats without added preservatives like nitrites or nitrates.  And for the 
happiest faces of all, we look for organic deli meats made from turkeys that haven't been treated with hormones 
(per federal regulations) or antibiotics - ever.  Trader Joe's Organic Oven Roasted Turkey Breast fits into all 
these categories, so please forgive us if we can't seem to wipe the smiles from our faces.

Trader Joe's Organic Oven Roasted Turkey Breast is sliced and ""shingled"" in an easy-to-open-and-reseal 
package, so they're a snap to use/eat. These thin, lightly salted, oven-roasted slices come from turkeys raised on 
an all-vegetarian diet in a free range environment. While we can't prove it, we'd like to postulate that happier 
turkeys lead to tastier deli meat. But don't take our word for it  - pay a visit to our refrigerated cases and put

"You may not be a meat eater, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the spiciness of authentic chorizo sausage.  
Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo is our vegetarian-friendly version of this traditionally Spanish sausage. It's made just 
for us by a small company that specializes in chorizo - they really do spend all their time focusing on chorizo, 
and we're pretty sure that's why this meat-free version is so authentically flavored.

The authenticity comes from the spices - the same spices that have made traditional pork chorizo so famous.  
We toss in a blend of paprika, sea salt, vinegar, red pepper, and garlic powder to hit you with just the right 
amount of bold flavors. Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo has all of these tasty seasonings, but also with the healthy 
attributes come from the soy protein. Our Soy Chorizo has no cholesterol and 60% less fat than traditional 
chorizo. Add it to scrambled eggs and make a quick breakfast burrito. Or sauté it with oven roasted potato 
wedges for an intriguing brunch time side dish that will have your guests raving.

"Our smoldering affection for smoked salmon and smoked trout is no secret - nor is it the end of the story, as 
far as our love for smoked fish is concerned. On a recent visit with a smoked fish supplier, we had the chance to 
try their sashimi-grade Sesame Crusted Smoked Ahi (also known as yellowfin) Tuna, which they were proud 
to inform us was sustainably sourced and wild caught off the coasts of Indonesia. One taste and we were (if 
you'll pardon the piscine pun) hooked. And thus, our appreciation for smoked fish extends and expands with 
Trader Joe's Sesame Crusted Hardwood Smoked Ahi Tuna.

With the texture of smoked salmon, the meaty flavor of high-quality fresh tuna, the crunch of sesame and just 
a touch of mild smokiness, this Smoked Ahi Tuna is a uniquely delicious addition to our deli section. You can 
use it as you would lox or any other smoked fish, on bagels, in quiches, or even eggs benedict, but that's just 
the beginning. Try it on top of rice bowls with a fresh, ginger-y salad, place it on pizza, or simply serve it as an 
appetizer with a little soy sauce for dipping. Normally, tuna of this quality would command a rather steep price. 
Fortunately, we're selling four-ounce packages of kosher, wild-caught Trader Joe's Sesame Crusted Hardwood 
Smoked Ahi Tuna for $5.99*, every day. You can find them in our refrigerators, with our other smoked fish.

"There are some places that are just known for what they do, more so than any other geographical location. For 
example, Nashville is known for country music. For Scotland, it's whisky. And for salami, Parma is where it's 
at-especially when ""it"" is Trader Joe's Uncured Salame di Parma Mild Salami.

Imported from Parma, Italy, this Uncured Salame is sliced and packaged in the U.S.A. to ensure the freshest 
product possible. But before it makes its way across the Atlantic, the pork is slowly aged in the air of the Italian 
Apennine Mountains, which creates an ideal climate for drying and aging meat. This results in a well-balanced, 
mild Salame, with subtle notes of spice and a clean, satisfyingly meaty flavor. And there are no nitrates or 
nitrites added, except for those naturally occurring in celery juice and sea salt.

For an Italian snack trifecta, pair this Salame with a few other things Italy is known for: freshly sliced Parmigiano 
Reggiano [sku 46837] and a bottle of Chianti [sku 79457]. Its mild flavor makes it a must-have when putting 
together a cheese plate. Roll up a slice and slide it on a toothpick with Giardiniera Pickled Vegetables [sku 60532] 
for an easy, party-worthy appetizer. Because it's packed in an easy open tray and thinly sliced, this Salame must 
remain refrigerated until you're ready to enjoy.

What are we known for here at Trader Joe's? Value. Which is why we're offering 4-ounce trays of Trader Joe's 
Uncured Salame di Parma Mild Salami for $4.99, a whole dollar less than you'll find elsewhere. You'll find 
them in our refrigerated case.
