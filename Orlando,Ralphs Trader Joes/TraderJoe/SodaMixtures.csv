"If you visit your neighborhood Trader Joe's, you'll really find a plethora of fruit-forward sparkling drinks from 
which to choose. Sometimes you need the tropical taste of Sparkling Pineapple Juice Beverage [sku 74009], or 
the sweetness of Sparkling Strawberry Juice Beverage [sku 67582]. When you're in the mood for something a bit 
more sophisticated, Organic Sparkling Rosé Tea Beverage is here for you.

This singular sipper starts with a blend of four Teas: delicate white, rich black, grassy sencha, and earthy pu-
erh. White grape juice from concentrate lends crisp fruitiness that complements the Tea blend's balanced 
profile, while hibiscus flowers, orange peel, and rose hips infuse floral, citrusy notes. With no added sugar, this 
refined, Tea-forward beverage sparkles like a flute of sparkling Rosé, sans the alcohol content. 

Crack open a chilled can and enjoy as a refreshing pick me up on a hot summer day. Or, pour a can into a glass, 
garnish with dried rose petals, and serve as a luxe mocktail at your next party or Sunday brunch.

"In these slow-going, sometimes sweltering, late days of summer, it's always a good idea to keep something cool 
and refreshing at the ready in your refrigerator. And for those times when you're looking for something sweet, 
something fruity, something fizzy... may we suggest Something Spritzy? Our new, summer-y variant of last 
year's winter-seasonal Something Spritzy with Grapefruit [sku 76687], Trader Joe's Something Spritzy with 
Pineapple and Orange is a truly tropical treat.

Equally delicious when enjoyed as an able accompaniment to a work lunch, a totable potable for a picnic, 
or a marvelous mocktail at a get-together, every sip of our Something Spritzy has a cool combo of Orange 
and Pineapple, plus a touch of ginger spice and botanical bitters to bring it all together. Bring a can or two 
along for your next barbecue, camping trip, or afternoon spent by the pool. Pair it with savory cheeses, spicy 
tacos, or pizza. Just be sure to pick it up soon, because, like the fading summer before us, Something Spritzy 
with Pineapple and Orange won't be around forever... While supplies last, you can find it with our sodas and 
sparkling waters.

"In France, lemonade takes on a different meaning. As long as it's carbonated and lemon-flavored, it qualifies 
as lemonade. We found a supplier in France that makes one of the best French lemonades, who now makes  
Trader Joe's Sparkling Lemonade for us, right from the French Market. Everything about this French drink 
will have you do a double take - from the fancy curves of the bottle, to the light blush colored drink, to the 
elegant labeling - you won't be able to resist picking up a bottle or two (or more, we won't judge).

We'll say though, this version of lemonade is different than the classic, fresh squeezed lemonade we're used 
to, it's less citrusy than you would expect and it's bubbly. You'll have to try for yourself - it's just simply good, 
delicious, and a great value for just $2.99* a bottle. See that guy holding up that glass of lemonade? That'll 
be you, toasting to the folks surrounding your dinner table, thankful to have such a fine glass of Trader Joe's

"Sometimes you're in the mood for a festive beverage-you know, the spritzy, sparkling kind-but you're not 
in the mood for wine or other spirits. And you don't quite want a soda, either. Well, we had you and your 
mocktail moods in mind when we created Trader Joe's Something Spritzy, our sensational new Sparkling 
Festive Beverage!

It's made with grapefruit, cranberry, and orange juices from concentrate. Of course, if it was just fruit juices 
with bubbles, then it would simply be sparkling juice. But with a stimulating, spirit-free sip in mind, we've 
added some aromatic bitter flavors and a touch of cane sugar. The contrast of the sweet and tart fruit juices 
with the herbal bitter flavors, all buoyed by tiny bubbles, creates a profile complex enough to convince your 
palate it's 'not just juice,' yet refreshing enough to beckon, sip, after sip, after sip... What's more, at 17 grams 
of sugar per can, it's a welcome change of pace from the saccharine soda options you might encounter at a

"As easy as it would be to refer to this Rosé Sparkling Tea as an excellent non-alcoholic alternative to Brut Rosé 
or other sparkling blushes, that's really only telling half of the story. While this bright, bubbly, and charmingly 
floral Tea is, indeed, a great non-alcoholic option for all kinds of occasions, it's also simply a fantastic drink in 
its own right. It's made for us by a supplier in Germany who takes a curated selection of premium black, green, 
white, and oolong tea leaves, slowly steeps them in cold water, then adds in a bit of grape must for a touch of 
sweetness. The resulting tea is easy-drinking, refined, and subtly complex in a way that's reminiscent of, but 
delightfully distinct from, a sparkling wine, with notes of red berries, peaches, and hibiscus flower.

Best served nice and chilled, and, for full effect of flavor and aroma, in a Champagne flute or wine glass, enjoy 
this Rosé Sparkling Tea at any event, big or small, that calls for celebration. Use it to toast the occasion at a 
holiday feast with extended family, serve it during a nice weekend dinner with just those closest to you, or even 
just sip it slowly as a flavorful, post-work pick-me-up. As for food pairing, think much in the same way you 
would a dry Prosecco: roast turkey, grilled seafood, spicy stir-fries, fluffy frittatas, and fruity desserts.

"Ginger is a real winner with our customers; one need look no further than the fervent fanbase for our holiday-
seasonal Triple Ginger Brew [sku 51857] for proof. For the past few years, we proudly carried a Brewed Ginger 
Beer [sku 54205] to ensure that this perennially popular potable is available year-round. Taking a cue from 
another of our ginger-y holiday favorites, the Sparkling Cranberry & Ginger Beverage [sku 69074], we felt like 
our Ginger Beer could use a bit of a packaging upgrade. Made for us by the same supplier using the same recipe 
as our bottled version, please allow us to (re-)introduce Trader Joe's Brewed Ginger Beer, now in a convenient 
4-pack of 12 fluid-ounce cans!

Just like its bottled predecessor, this non-alcoholic beverage is made from ingredients that include: water, 
sugar, ginger juice, lime and lemon juices from concentrate, and ginger extract. It has a refreshing, gingery bite, 
and mild carbonation. The addition of lemon and lime juices adds a zesty, citrus zing, and also helps establish 
the right acidic balance. After canning, our Brewed Ginger Beer is pasteurized, which gives it shelf stability. 

We think our Ginger Beer makes the perfect refresher, all by itself-chilled, or over ice. But, there's also no 
denying it enhances the character of spirits. Enjoy a Bermudan classic, the Dark & Stormy, made with dark 
rum and Ginger Beer. Or, imbibe a customized Mule cocktail: in a copper mug (if you've got it), mix our 
Brewed Ginger Beer with lime juice and your favorite vodka, tequila, whiskey, or gin.

"Question: Why should drinkers have all the fizzy, festive fun? Answer: They shouldn't-and we're bringing back 
Trader Joe's Sparkling White Chardonnay Grape Juice to prove it!

This Sparkling Grape Juice is a non-drinker's holiday dream come true. It's a simple blend, really, and the 
secret's in the grapes. Instead of any old grape juice, we use white grape juice made exclusively from Spanish-
grown Chardonnay grapes! (Yes, those Chardonnay grapes-our supplier just juices them before they're given 
a chance to ferment into wine.) We infuse said Grape Juice with plenty of bubbles, plus a bit of citric acid and 
vitamin C to acidify and (naturally) preserve, and the result is a clean, crisp, sweet sparkler with a nice, non-
alcoholic bite. 

Pop a fancy, foiled 750-mL bottle of Trader Joe's Sparkling White Chardonnay Grape Juice at your next 
holiday soirée, then raise a glass to grapes!

"We're big fans of ginger here at Trader Joe's. Be it in the form of candies, snaps, breads, or muffins, ginger offers the 
kind of sweet, spicy, and invigorating sensation that always leaves us wanting more. Luckily, ""more"" is precisely 
what you'll get with Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Brew-a TJ's holiday favorite for nearly ten years running.

When we originally set out to create our Triple Ginger Brew, we kept finding that most of what was out on the 
market was a little, er, lacking in the ginger department. We tasted sample after sample, until we finally found 
what we were looking for: a bold Brew with big bite, courtesy of the substantial amount of fresh ginger added 
during the brewing process. It really does offer that one-two-three ginger punch-perfect for ginger devotees 
like us.

While supplies last, you can find our refreshing, non-alcoholic Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Brew in its signature 
emerald-green, 750mL bottle (the old-fashioned, swing-top closure is a fall fan favorite) in the sodas and

"Did you ever wonder what the visions of sugar plums looked like dancing overhead in that famous Christmas 
poem? Maybe you envision whole, purple plums, like bouncing fruit above sleeping children. Actually, when 
that poem was written, sugar plums were not plums, at all! They were comfit, or little candy confections of 
dried fruits or nuts coated with a sugary layer. 

If this bursts your bubble, we've got something bubbly to make up for it: Trader Joe's Sugar Plum Sparkling 
Beverage. No, this is a not a beverage made of melted candies. We took liberties with the sugar plum concept 
(as many others have done in modern times), and created a drink that is literally plum-based. Carbonated 
water is combined with plum juice and white grape juice concentrates. This 50% juice/50% sparkling water 
beverage makes for the ideal seasonal swill that is lower in sugar than 100% juice would be. And, it's a festive, 
light-red color that tastes exactly like what you (incorrectly) imagined those dancing sugar plums would have 
tasted like in liquid form.

"There's a certain romance in the idea of drinking cranberry juice at Thanksgiving. But the reality is, pure 
cranberry juice is powerfully pucker-provoking; it can be too much tart for many people to enjoy. That's why 
we created Trader Joe's Sparkling Cranberry Flavored Juice Blend. 

This beverage maintains the cranberry mystique, but in a perfectly sweet-tart alternative. It begins with 
sparkling water, just enough to bring to life cranberry juice and white grape concentrates. The addition of 
cranberry purée ups the cranberry ante, while a little lemon juice rounds out the brightness. (Don't worry, 
we didn't lose that zing!) Our Sparkling Cranberry Flavored Juice Blend is fizzy, deep red, with a tart-sweet 
flavor that is eminently drinkable. And since this bubbly is not boozy, you can keep the refills coming! Only 
available during the holiday season.

This Cranberry Ginger Beverage is 100% alcohol free. The main ingredients are ginger juice and concentrated

"If you've ever had cold brew coffee, you're probably aware of how smooth and mellow it is, especially compared 
to hot brewed coffee. There's some science behind that difference: when coffee grounds are mixed with hot 
water, they tend to release the coffee's tannins, the chemicals that give coffee its natural, bitter edge (they're 
also what gives red wine its ""dry"" flavor). With cold water, however, the tannins typically stay in the grounds, 
leaving a smoother, easier-drinking beverage. The same principle applies to tea: the colder and longer the 
steeping time, the mellower and rounder-flavored the tea. Need proof? Look no further than Trader Joe's 
Raspberry & Black Currant Organic Cold Brew Black Tea.

Made especially for us by an expert tea supplier in Thailand, this Organic Cold Brew Black Tea is sweetened 
with a bit of cane sugar and flavored with bright, tangy raspberry and rich, earthy black currant. Every sip is mild, 
sweet, and delectably fruity, and since it's cold brewed, conspicuously absent of the astringent notes you'd find in 
hot brewed teas. Altogether, it makes for an extra refreshing drink, especially when served ice cold on a scorching 
hot day. We think its price is pretty refreshing, too: we're selling 16.9-ounce bottles of Raspberry & Black Currant 
Organic Cold Brew Black Tea for $1.29, every day. Look for them with our other shelf stable beverages.

"In the last decade, the coconut has experienced quite the renaissance. At Trader Joe's alone, one can find a host 
of coconut-based products-from coconut oil, to coconut sugar, to coconut cream, to coconut water. Ah, yes, 
coconut water. Light, mild, and exceptionally hydrating, coconut water is easily the most refreshing of all the 
coconut products we carry. But if you think regular coconut water is refreshing, wait until you try Sparkling 
Coconut Water. And if you think Sparkling Coconut Water sounds refreshing on its own, well, wait until you 
try Trader Joe's Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. That's right; infused with real yuzu puree, it's anything 
but the yuzu-al¿

Cultivated primarily in East Asia, yuzu is a round, yellowish citrus fruit whose fragrant, flavorful flesh is prized 
the world over. Sweeter than a lemon yet livelier than an orange, yuzu is tangy, bright, and delicate (almost floral, 
some say), making it a welcome addition to summery sauces, dressings, and-yes-beverages. Like our light, 
crisp, and refreshing Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu. And speaking of something refreshing, we don't 
add any sugar whatsoever to this fizzy delight (we let the coconut and the yuzu do the sweetening), so each can 
contains just 10 grams of naturally-occurring sugars and 60 calories! 

Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu is slightly tropical, subtly sweet, and best enjoyed chilled over ice, or in 
a tropical cocktail. And even if you're three sheets to the wind thanks to said tropical cocktail, we'll wager that 
you'll always remember this key equation: Coconut Water + Yuzu puree + CO2 = pure, fizzy refreshment. We're 
selling each 4-pack of 8.45-fluid ounce cans for $3.99-you'll find them in our shelf-stable beverage aisle.
