"Towering over Nicaragua's border with Honduras, Cerro Mogotón is an awe-inspiring sight, covered in lush 
mountain forests and winding hiking trails. It's also known for producing some of Nicaragua's finest coffees-
like Trader Joe's Cerro Mogotón Small Lot Coffee. It comes to us from a single family farm situated a little 
more than halfway up the mountain, where the impressive elevation results in full-flavored beans with notes 
of nutty caramel and sweet baked apples. A light roast brew with mild acidity, it makes for an easy-drinking, 
well-rounded cup.

Cerro Mogotón brews beautifully in a drip coffee maker, Chemex, French press, or Moka pot, with a ratio of 
two tablespoons of coffee for each six fluid ounces of water. Enjoy it as a light and flavorful morning cup of 
joe, with or without a warm Apple Cinnamon Bun [sku 77107] or slice of Cinnamon Coffee Cake [sku 94235]. 
If dessert's on your mind, Teeny Tiny Pecan Pies [sku 79121] will accentuate the coffee's toasty caramel notes.

Cerro Mogotón Small Lot Coffee may be big on flavor, but its availability is truly small. Pick up a bag from 
your neighborhood store while supplies last!

"For the newest addition to our Small Lot Coffee program, we're making a triumphant return to Chiapas, 
the same state in southern Mexico from which our Organic Chiapas Mexico Small Lot Coffee [sku 65505] 
originated. This time, however, we've sourced our coffee from a group of growers within the La Concordia 
region of Chiapas, where the high elevation and oceanic microclimate create optimum conditions for growing 
rich, chocolatey, full-flavored coffees. True to form, each sip of Trader Joe's La Concordia Mexico Small Lot 
Coffee is indeed remarkably rich, deliciously chocolatey, and fabulously full-flavored, with notes of sticky 
caramel and fresh berries throughout.

Much of that is owed to La Concordia's unique environment: once the hand-picked beans are washed and laid 
out to dry in the sun, the humidity makes it necessary for them to dry for a considerably longer time than is 
typical for other coffee-growing regions. This increased contact between the beans and their husks allows the 
flavors within the husks to infuse into the bean, resulting in a fruit-forward cup of Coffee. We recommend 
serving La Concordia with all kinds of breakfast fare: everything from a hearty omelette, to simple eggs and 
toast, to a superbly saucy plate of chilaquiles.

"If you peruse the coffee beverage offerings at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, you'll see that we're big fans of 
cold brew. From bold Black Cold Brew Coffee [sku 56952] to festive Pumpkin Spice Flavored Cold Brew Coffee 
Concentrate [sku 79207], we strive to concoct cold brews that satsify all tastes. If sweet and aromatic is your 
flavor profile jam, you'll become fast friends with Vanilla Cardamom Flavored Cold Brew Coffee.

They say that good things come to those who wait, and this Cold Brew's slow brewing process certainly proves 
the adage to be true. We start with 100% Arabica Coffee beans that are steeped for 12 hours in cold water-this 
extracts the Coffee's flavor without making it bitter. It's then flavored with Vanilla and Cardamom, lending 
sweet, floral, and herbal notes that complement the Coffee's robust profile. Smooth with mild acidity, the final 
product makes for easy drinking-even straight out of the bottle, if you're so inclined. 

Serve it black over ice, or add a splash of milk (or non-dairy beverage) and a bit of sugar to let the flavors really 
sing. By the way-did we mention this Cold Brew comes in a generous 32-fluid-ounce bottle, for about the 
same price as a single serving of comparable drinks at chain Coffee shops? Such a steal won't last long, so grab 
yours while supplies last!

"One of the more interesting aspects of coffee is how much its level of roast can affect its flavor. Whereas lighter 
roast coffees tend to have a brighter, crisper, more delicately acidic character to them, dark roasts are bigger, 
bolder, and often quite chocolatey. But did you know that going through a roasting process can also have a 
similar affect on herbal teas? Take Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Herbal Tea, for instance. Made with a blend 
of rich, roasted carob, barley, and chicory, along with a bit of dried fig and date to add a dark, fruity undertone, 
this terrifically toasty and full-flavored tea has a remarkable depth of flavor. So much so, in fact, that it almost 
feels more like a coffee on the palate than an everyday herbal tea, while still remaining naturally caffeine-free.

An excellent choice for anyone who loves the taste of coffee but prefers to avoid caffeine, anyone who likes their 
tea extra strong, or indeed anyone who enjoys unique and full-flavored beverages of all kinds, our Organic 
Roasted Herbal Tea can be served in any situation where coffee would be called for. Sip it slow with a nice 
sweet pastry. Ice it and mix with milk or your favorite non-dairy alternative. Or pair it with any of your favorite 
breakfast options for a long, luxurious, weekend brunch.

"Situated in the lush, green highlands of West Java, the region of Parahyangan gets its name from an old 
Sundanese word for ""the abode of the gods."" Here, sheltered by the shade of the Perhutani forest, several 
smallholding coffee farmers cultivate some of the richest, most flavorful coffee beans that Indonesia has to 
offer. Our latest limited-release, small lot coffee, Trader Joe's Java of the Gods, comes to us from a collection 
of these farmers, and easily lives up to Parahyangan's name-each strong, full-bodied sip is practically divine.

Semi-sweet, toasty, and marked with notes of cacao, our Java of the Gods has a substantial mouthfeel and 
dark, chocolatey profile that's ideal for serving with decadent desserts and all sorts of breakfast dishes, savory 
and sweet. When paired with a stack of syrupy Belgian Waffles [sku 96967] or toasted, buttered Pancake Bread 
[sku 63303], for instance, its relatively low acidity and semi-bitter edges (resulting from this Java's deep, dark 
roast) will cut through the sweetness, providing a captivating complement. When served alongside a savory 
omelette, breakfast sandwich, or plate of spicy chilaquiles, however, those same qualities will allow the stronger 
flavors from both the coffee and the food to intermingle and reinforce one another. However you pair this Java 
of the Gods, or even if you just plan to sip it solo, be sure to pick up a bag before too long, because supplies are 
decidedly limited.

"It turns out that a long drive, a closed truck, and hot weather are the perfect combination for a truly special 
brew. Enter Trader Joe's Tropical Bahia Brazil Small Lot Coffee!

After harvesting, coffee beans need hot, arid weather to thoroughly dry before roasting. The high growing 
regions of Bahia, Brazil aren't blessed with such conditions, so growers send their beans away to sunnier 
regions-this journey is where the Tropical Bahia Brazil magic happens.

Ripe Arabica coffee beans spend the long drive in a hot, closed truck. These conditions set off a fermentation 
process that, unlike the controlled and monitored process for most coffee, happens naturally and with minimal 
interference. Such spontaneity gives Tropical Bahia Brazil  its unique character. A medium roast results in a 
balanced coffee that boasts layered flavors, notes of sweet fruits, and a touch of acidity.  

Once in our hands, the beans are packed in bags with one-way valves that keep oxygen out-this helps to 
preserve their singular flavor. Brew hot for an interesting morning cup, pair with fruit pastries like Raspberry 
Croissant Carré [sku 77043] and Strawberry & Rhubarb Hand Pies [sku 74290], or enjoy over ice with a splash 
of milk (or a non-dairy alternative) for an afternoon pick-me-up.

Tropical Bahia Brazil is part of our Small Lot Coffee program, which means quantities are truly small. Pick up 
a bag and brew a cup while it's on our shelves!

"Much like a wine or cheese, the quality of any given tea is highly dependent on where it was harvested. For 
certain teas, however, when it was harvested is just as, if not more, important. For example, during the first 
few weeks of spring, as assamica tea plants in northwestern India begin to mature, their first flush of leaf buds 
end in a distinct, golden tip. These golden-tipped leaves are prized for being richer, sweeter, and even slightly 
higher in caffeine than standard Assam leaves (which are already quite excellent)-and they're exactly what 
you'll find in every box of Trader Joe's Organic Assam Golden Black Tea.

Bold and malty, with a faintly fruity profile, this full-flavored Assam Golden Black Tea is cultivated for us 
using organic practices in India's bountiful Brahmaputra valley, nestled in the state of Assam (from which 
this tea gets its name, in fact). It serves just as well hot or iced, as-is or with a splash of milk or your favorite 
non-dairy creamer. We find that its strong character and notes of toasted rice make it a lovely pairing option 
for breakfast pastries, fresh fruit, or a nice, sharp Cheddar cheese. And just as timing is important to this tea's 
harvest, it's also paramount if you want to pick up a box at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, because supplies of 
this Organic Assam Golden Black Tea are decidedly limited.

"As one of the leading cultivators of some of the finest coffees in the world, the country of Kenya has a unique 
system of rating its coffee beans at point of harvest. At the top of this scale is the treasured ""AA"" grade, denoting 
beans with the largest size and most consistent shape of the entire crop. AA-rated coffee beans are renowned 
for their rich flavor profiles and dazzlingly deep aromas, and the newest addition to our Small Lot Coffee series 
is no exception. It's brought to us by a collective of small farmers in Karatu, Kenya, who plant, harvest, and 
process these AA-rated beans entirely by hand, to ensure that every sip is superlatively smooth and satisfying.

Once ground and brewed to your personal preferences, Trader Joe's Kenya AA Karatu Small Lot Coffee 
makes a complex, yet balanced cup, with a bold, full body that's complemented by a pleasantly citric acid 
structure. While it's an excellent (albeit elevated) everyday kind of coffee, we find it serves especially well as 
part of a big breakfast or brunch: its bright notes of black currant and cacao make it a great pairing option with 
a flaky chocolate croissant, an auspicious eggs Benedict, or a tall stack of pancakes covered in fresh berries.

"Grown under the forest canopies of Guji, near the southern end of Ethiopia's Oromia region, Trader Joe's 
Organic Ethiopia Guji Small Lot Coffee exhibits all the very best qualities of its prestigious provenance. These 
heirloom, organically grown, 100% Arabica beans are handpicked on local farms, carefully dried under the sun 
on raised beds, then roasted to a balanced light-medium roast. 

Once brewed, each cup of our Organic Ethiopia Guji Small Lot Coffee is redolent with notes of fresh berries, 
dried fruit, and warm spices, finishing with just a touch of uplifting acidity. It makes for an excellent anytime 
cuppa Joe, and we especially enjoy sipping it alongside a TJ's Salted Caramel Danish [sku 77105] or a spinach

"The simple act of brewing a cup of morning coffee can provide a moment of culinary Zen-a quiet and creative 
start to one's day, before the flurry of mundane and required tasks kick in. But for those in a rush, this kind of 
ceremonial coffee prep at daybreak is pure fantasy. 

While Trader Joe's may not be able to guarantee daily moments of peaceful meditation around the coffee pot, we 
are doing our part to simplify your coffee making process¿ Our whole bean, Joe's Dark Coffee [sku 93936] has 
been a customer favorite since it first arrived, and now, for those seeking to minimize their morning rush, we're 
introducing Joe's Dark Ground Coffee.

Joe's Dark is a no frills, rich, full-bodied, cup of joe. We heat a blend of 100% Arabica beans from South Amer-
ica to a dark-roast profile-that place where drinkability, smoothness, and enjoyability meet. Then, we grind 
the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness canister. This 
means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No 
noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we still recommend ap-
proximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water.

If you already enjoy the whole bean version, and are looking for new ways to simplify your morning routine, 
switching to Joe's Dark Ground Coffee is an easy step in the right direction. And, it's easy on your budget, too, 
since it comes in the same size canister as the whole bean-version, for exactly the same price. That's $4.99 for 
13 ounces.

"Located in the northeastern corner of India, Darjeeling is known for its beautiful Buddhist and Hindu temples, 
dramatic mountain vistas, and, of course, its tea. Blessed with a mild, subtropical climate, and dizzying 4,000-
foot elevation, Darjeeling has some of the best conditions on the planet for growing tea leaves, producing 
blends marked with an elegantly delicate sweetness and herby, refreshing aroma. We're big Darjeeling devotees 
here at Trader Joe's, and as such, we're especially excited to bring this elegant and easy-drinking Trader Joe's 
Organic Darjeeling White Tea to our shelves for a limited time.

Made with only the youngest buds of Darjeeling tea shoots, then minimally processed and sun-dried to 
preserve its delicately floral flavor, this Organic White Tea brews to an exquisitely subtle flavor profile. Each 
sip is superlatively smooth, with bright and ever-so-slightly sweet notes of green grapes and citrus leaves, 
supported by a soft and silky mouth feel. As a breakfast tea, it sets your day off on a remarkably refined note, 
especially when served with similarly subtle flavors: try it with a mild fruit salad, a scone with clotted cream, 
or an egg white omelette with spinach and goat cheese.

"Sometimes you want a big, bold, brash cup of coffee. We have you covered. There are also times when you want 
a cup of coffee that's a little more on the mellow side, with strong coffee flavor but without the intensity you get 
from some brews. Trader Joe's Organic Breakfast Blend is the coffee for those occasions.

You may have noticed a new look for our Organic Breakfast Blend-rather than a canister, it now comes in a 
valved bag. In addition to being a more efficient form of packaging, the bag also helps protect your coffee, too: 
when coffee beans are roasted, they emit a small amount of CO2, and can continue to do so even after being 
sealed in packaging. This valve lets that CO2 escape, without letting any oxygen in, ensuring that your coffee 
stays fresh and that the bag doesn't inflate. Ingenious!

Other than its new packaging, it's still the same great coffee, still sourced for us from a series of small coffee 
cooperatives across Latin America, including Southern Mexico, Guatemala, and the Peruvian Andes. Organic, 
kosher, and fair trade certified, it's a beautifully balanced Blend that's been toasted to a medium roast to create 
a smooth, mellow, super-drinkable flavor profile. We find that makes it the ideal brew with which to start your 
day-which is why we call it Breakfast Blend. Try it with your favorite traditional breakfast fare, served black, 
or, if you'd like an even smoother sip, with a spoonful or two of our Coconut Creamer [sku 52909].

"Trader Joe's Fair Trade Organic Bolivian Blend Coffee has been a customer favorite since it first appeared 
on our shelves in 2008. The 100% Arabica beans are cultivated by small family farms between the Andes 
mountains and the Amazon river basin. Governed by sustainable Fair Trade practices, these Bolivian farmers 
are able to make a living wage as they grow, harvest, and process this premier Coffee. And their Organic 
farming approach ensures that synthetic fertilizers & other synthetic processing chemicals are left out, which 
helps protect the environment, while also guarding the natural flavors imparted by this unique soil & climate.

And speaking of flavor, such admirable attributes as Fair Trade and Organic wouldn't matter much if the 
coffee didn't also taste good. In fact, Trader Joe's Organic Bolivian Blend is a truly delicious and supremely 
balanced brew! The medium-dark roast presents a smooth-textured body, delicate acidity, and sweet notes that 
are characteristic of caramel. Yum!

To get this Coffee into our customers hands (and mugs), we've worked hard to secure a price that is a real value. 
Though the market retail for fair trade, organic beans is generally higher, by purchasing large amounts-and 
by switching to a more cost-efficient bag-we've been able to keep our price in a range that makes Trader Joe's 
Fair Trade Organic Bolivian Blend what we consider to be a fair trade for our customers, too!

"Those rumors brewing across the land are true: Trader Joe's French Roast has got a brand new bag! Brought to 
us by a new supplier, whose increased efficiencies (including the change to a bag, rather than a canister) allow 
us to offer this rich, super dark-roasted whole bean coffee for a signifcantly lower retail, our new French Roast 
is nothing if not buzz-worthy. It's made with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Peru and Brazil, which, when 
made into drip, pour-over, or even cold brew coffee, creates a rich, robust cup with notes of cacao, baking spice, 
and toasted pecans.

So, what precisely makes a coffee blend with Peruvian and Brazilian beans a French Roast? The ""French"" 
actually refers to the level of roast, rather than its geographical provenance. While food historians aren't entirely 
certain when and where the term originated, it's very likely a reference to the fact that, in the 19th century, 
super dark-roasted coffee was all the rage in French cafés. One sip of our French Roast, and it's easy to see 
why: in addition to imparting a deep, dark hue to the beans, the extra roasting time also intensifies its sweet, 
chocolatey aromatics, and heightens the nuttiness and spice on the palate.

"Sourced from Guatemala, Indonesia, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru, Trader Joe's Fairtrade Organic Five 
Country Blend is a global coffee bean tour in a bag. Each country contributes something unique to this bold, 
well-balanced, whole bean Blend: the Guatemalan beans offer notes of toasted almonds and chocolate; the 
Indonesian beans add earthiness and spiciness; the Honduran beans bring depth and body; the Mexican beans 
supply subtle, fruity undertones; and the Peruvian beans lend a lively, medium acidity. As one of our darkest, 
richest roasts, it's excellent for making everything from espresso, to pour-over, to French press.

Long-time Five Country fans may recall the previous canister of Five Country Espresso Blend [sku 55790] 
offered on shelves-it had an admittedly limiting moniker, as ""Espresso"" referenced a single coffee preparation 
instead of the numerous ways a dark roast coffee can be ground, brewed and enjoyed. Our new Five Country 
Blend maintains the beloved flavor profile and bean origins of its predecessor, is still Organic and kosher 
(pareve)-certified, and holds Fairtrade certification, guaranteeing small-scale growers are given a fair price for 
their harvest. And speaking of a fair price, great news: increased efficiencies with our new supplier (along with 
the new packaging) mean we get to pass significant savings along to you!

"Hailing from the Yirgacheffe region of Ethiopia, Trader Joe's FTO Shade Grown Ethiopian Coffee is a medium 
dark roast blend straight out of this birthplace of coffee.  It is within the forests of the Kaffa region that arabica 
coffee was first found growing wild. 

This coffee has got it all - it's USDA organic, shade grown, and fair trade certified which supports fair sale prices 
given to farmers for the 100% arabica green beans they grow so well. And grown under a canopy of trees, our 
FTO Shade Grown Ethiopian Coffee is grown nestling itself amongst a diverse habitat in its natural setting 
as opposed to many modern, sun-tolerant coffee plants that are grown in direct sunlight. All of this comes 
together in harmony to receive its medium dark roasting to give a rich tasting, medium bodied coffee that 
takes on a slightly acidic tartness and floral aroma. The beans are then packaged immediately and the canister 
nitrogen flushed to help ensure the freshest beans are what you smell when you get home and peel back the 
freshness seal.

"Given that people have been growing, brewing, and enjoying coffee for over five hundred years, one might 
expect that we've already learned everything there is to know about the coffee bean. Well, the newest entry into 
our Small Lot Coffee series proves that simply isn't so. Hailing from Brazil's Vale da Grama (literally ""Valley of 
Grass""), a coffee region renowned for its well-balanced and citric coffees, Trader Joe's Cachoeira da Grama 
Small Lot Coffee (so named for an iconic waterfall, or cachoeira, near our supplier) is the product of pure 
innovation. To make each batch, our supplier employs an ingenious double-fermentation process, where beans 
are first fermented in open air tanks, then again in airtight barrels to create lush, vibrant, and superlatively 
smooth flavor profile.

It's a difference you can taste in every cup of Cachoeira da Grama: each sip starts with aromas of citrus leaves 
and ripe fruit, which leads into balanced flavors of dried plum and orange zest, and eventually into a long, lazy 
finish. An excellent candidate for preparing via French press or enjoyed as pour over, Cachoeira da Grama 
mixes marvelously well with milk or your favorite non-dairy creamer, and pairs especially well with breakfast 
pastries, brunch fare, and toffee-like candies, like our Pecan Pralines [sku 28077]. Supplies are limited, so be 
sure to grab this double-fermented Small Lot Coffee on the double!

"Located in the northeastern corner of India, Darjeeling is known for its beautiful Buddhist and Hindu temples, 
dramatic mountain vistas, and, of course, its tea. Blessed with a mild, subtropical climate, and dizzying 4,000-
foot elevation, Darjeeling has some of the best conditions on the planet for growing tea leaves, producing 
blends marked with an elegantly delicate sweetness and herby, refreshing aroma. In fact, Darjeeling is often 
called ""the Champagne of teas,"" which is certainly an apt comparison point for our fine, bright, and lightly 
fruity Trader Joe's Organic Darjeeling Green Tea. (Except for the bubbles, of course.)

Naturally sweet and rich in antioxidants, our Organic Darjeeling Green Tea serves just as well as a special 
occasion kind of tea, with cucumber sandwiches and Macarons [sku 51604], as it does your everyday cuppa. 
We're particularly fond of enjoying it as a morning or afternoon pickmeup, especially when paired with pastries, 
fruits, or mild and tangy fare: think fresh cut melon, a slice of French Apple Tart [sku 57284], or slices of apple 
spread with a bit of Fine Herbs Chevre [sku 88544].

"One typically hears the term ""terroir"" used exclusively in relation to wine-and yet, this concept of climate and 
terrain being indicative of flavor is just as applicable to coffee. The beans in each bag of our limited-edition 
Trader Joe's Guatemala La Morena Peaberry Small Lot Coffee, for example, hail from the women-owned La 
Morena collective of farms, situated near the city of Huehuetenango in western Guatemala. Here, the region's 
warm, humid, subtropical climate and lush, limestone soils make ideal growing conditions for crafting this 
rich, chocolatey, and superlatively smooth coffee-the kind that conjures the character of its terroir with every 
satisfying sip.

In addition to its impressive provenance, the makers of this Small Lot Coffee have also ensured that each bag 
contains only the very best of the very best coffee beans from their harvest. While there are usually two beans 
in each coffee cherry, approximately 5% of coffee crops yield Peaberry beans, which are smaller and prized for 
their concentrated flavors. In these Peaberry beans, those flavors express themselves as dark chocolate, ripe 
blackberry, and a sweet, cozy finishing note of brown sugar. We recommend enjoying each cup in a context 
where you can slowly savor every sip, like paired with a flaky pastry, avocado toast, or a few squares of our Dark 
Chocolate Bar with Almonds [sku 90725].

"We're big fans of hot chocolate. But this isn't hot chocolate. It's better! Big claim, we know, but Trader Joe's 
Sipping Chocolate really puts the ""chocolate"" in sipping chocolate.

¿ is rich, deep, dark chocolate was inspired by memories of relaxing in an outdoor European café, sipping 
velvety-smooth warm chocolate from a demitasse. Trader Joe's Sipping Chocolate was created with sipping 
in mind (in case you were wondering). Its chocolate ¿ avors are so deep and rich that it really does invite you

creamiest texture and greatest chocolate depths. It's the holidays, so indulge a little.

natural ¿ avor (from soy), and a bit of salt. Simple, yet decadent. Flavorful, yet re¿ ned. ¿ is is grown-up hot

Indulge in a cup any time you need an excuse to relax, or enjoy it with a Chocolate Danish or Petit Fours. Share 
a cup or gi¿  the entire tin as an expression of friendship and fondness-it's really lovely, really rich, wondrous

"What's the ideal companion to a stack of TJ's Pumpkin Pancakes [sku 93044] with TJ's Organic Bourbon Barrel 
Aged Maple Syrup [sku 63562]? Why, a cup of Trader Joe's Autumn Maple Coffee, of course. This caffeinated 
creation is a captivating encapsulation of carefully curated coffee -100% Arabica beans from Central America, 
Colombia, and Brazil - and the well-balanced addition of natural maple flavor made with real Vermont maple 
syrup. 

Every cup delivers subtly sweet maple flavor that complements that stack of pancakes, a plate of eggs, or a 
ramekin of yogurt. If you're the type of coffee drinker who adds milk and sugar to your brew, you'll benefit 
from a more robust maple presence - we've found that augmenting flavored coffees this way results in enhanced 
flavor manifestation, sip after sip.

We've ordered a limited amount of Autumn Maple Coffee, so if it sounds pleasing to your palate, plan a trip to 
Trader Joe's soon so you don't miss out! We're selling each 14 ounce bag for $7.99.

"If you're a fan of flavored coffee, you know that not all flavored coffees are created equal. Thankfully, the only 
flavored coffees you'll find at your neighborhood Trader Joe's are those that have been evaluated to meet our 
exacting standards for a cup of joe-flavored or not-and then naturally flavored in a way that highlights 
the carefully selected base blend of beans. It's with this in mind that we're thrilled to introduce Trader Joe's 
Chocolate Hazelnut Ground Coffee to our everyday coffee offerings.

Our supplier sources 100% Arabica beans from Cerrado de Minas, one of the most renowned coffee growing 
regions in Brazil. The small bean size from this region produces a full-bodied, mildly flavored brew with a 
creamy mouthfeel; once the beans are given a light roast and ground, they provide the ideal backdrop for 
the infusion of a natural flavor oil imbued with fragrant notes of rich Chocolate and toasted Hazelnut. The 
result is a delightfully smooth sipping experience with every cup, whether you're in the mood for a welcoming 
wakeup or warming treat on a chilly afternoon. Sip it straight to let the flavors shine, or add a splash of creamer 
to further enhance the Coffee's inherent sweetness and velvety mouthfeel.

"Jarabacoa, located in the central region of the Dominican Republic, is home to third-generation coffee farmers 
who are dedicated to the cultivation of high-quality coffee beans. For this small-lot selection, these farmers 
harvest 100% Arabica coffee cherries, then refine their skins and pulp. Normally, the sticky-sweet outer layer 
of the coffee fruit is washed off, but these beans are ""honey processed,"" so that layer is left intact. Because they 
spend less time in water, the sun-dried beans ferment less and retain more natural sweetness.

Trader Joe's Dominican Republic Jarabacoa Small Lot Coffee wears its honey process on its sip. Immediately, 
a taster can detect a subtle sweetness, accompanied by notes of chocolate and hints of blackberry. The honeyed 
profile pairs wonderfully with sweet breakfast pastries, like Trader Joe's Pumpkin Ginger Scones [sku 76650]. Sip 
it in the afternoon with a dunk of an Apple Cider Donut [sku 64320], or enjoy it after dinner, affogato style, with 
a scoop of Trader Joe's Salted Maple Ice Cream [sku 74637].

"The coffee beans inside each bag of Trader Joe's Nicaragua La Bastilla Estate Small Lot Coffee have been 
dubbed ""blueberry candy"" by farmers for their unique sweetness and subtle blueberry aroma. These 100% 
Arabica beans (of the Red Catuai variety)  are grown on the La Bastilla Estate, which sits 4,300 feet above sea 
level in Nicaragua's mountainous Jinotega region. The Estate's high altitude and rich, volcanic soils produce 
coffee with distinctive character and complexity. The beans are carefully hand-picked at peak ripeness, sun-
dried on raised beds, then treated to a medium roast-ultimately producing a cup of coffee with layered notes 
of cocoa, pineapple, cherry, and, of course, blueberry. 

Brew a cup or a pot with your French press or automatic coffee maker and sip alongside some sweet breakfast 
treats, like a Blueberry Muffin [sku 64741], a Cheese Pastry Roll [sku 73475], fresh from the oven, or a toasted 
Whole Wheat English Muffin [sku 14627]. We're selling each 12-ounce bag of whole-bean Nicaragua La Bastilla 
Estate Small Lot Coffee for a limited time. You'll find it in our coffee and tea section.

"Grown at a high elevation in its namesake Nilgiris district in southern India, Trader Joe's Organic Nilgiri 
Black Tea has a highly complex, beautifully balanced flavor profile. Each smooth, satisfying sip starts with 
notes of stonefruit and honey, then takes on more floral qualities, until it eventually reveals the vibrant tones 
of a newly bloomed orchid. A truly versatile tea, our Organic Nilgiri can be enjoyed hot or iced, entirely on its 
own, or paired with all kinds of foods and flavors.

In fact, we encourage you to get a little adventurous with it: try it alongside a crostini with Unexpected Cheddar 
Spread [sku 74802], with a rice bowl of saucy Shrimp Boom Bah [sku 73707], or even with a sweet Snacky 
Cluster [sku 74539], straight from the bag. It's special enough to make a great gift for the tea connoisseurs in 
your life, yet easy-drinking enough to be appreciated by casual tea drinkers, too. Just be sure to pick up a box of 
Trader Joe's Organic Nilgiri Black Tea while you can, because supplies are decidedly limited. While inventory 
lasts, you'll find them with our other boxed teas.

"Much like wine or cheese, the quality of any given tea is highly dependent on its origins. Trader Joe's Organic 
Assam Black Tea, for example, is grown for us in the state of Assam in northeastern India, where the assamica 
variety of the tea plant has grown for thousands of years, and which is now the most productive tea-growing 
region on the globe. Here, the hot, humid climate, relatively flat topography, and proximity to the Brahmaputra 
river create ideal growing conditions for this Organic  Assam Black Tea, resulting in its uniquely rich, robust, 
and slightly malty flavor profile.

Exceptionally delicious when enjoyed as your first morning cup, our Organic Assam Black Tea brews to a 
dark, golden red and emanates an earthy, spicy aroma that truly invigorates the senses. We find that its full-
bodied profile befits pairing with similarly full-flavored fare, like savory breakfast sausage, an omelette with 
Crunchy Chili Onion [sku 62480], or a plate of chicken and waffles. During the warmer months of the year, this 
Organic Assam makes an excellent iced tea, too, especially when garnished with a wedge of lemon or lime.

"Hot tea-in all its varieties-brings warmth, health, and a sense of friendly hospitality to the table. Hav-
ing known this for centuries, the Japanese developed a ritual called Chado-literally ""the Way of Tea""-to 
celebrate the art of this ancient beverage. Central to this ritual is a very special powdered tea called Matcha. 
Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea Latte Mix puts this exceptional tea right at your fingertips, for all your mo-
ments-whether casual or ceremonious.

Many of us associate ""powdered"" beverages with kids' drinks-Kool-Aid, anyone? But, before you decide that 
Matcha is not your cup of tea, get this: In contrast to coarsely prepared leaves of tea that are meant for steep-
ing in a bag or infuser, pure Matcha leaves are milled into a fine powder. When whisked into hot water-as 
ritualized in Chado-this tea-powder dissolves completely, yielding a wholesome cup that maintains all the 
nutrients, antioxidants, fiber, and chlorophyll found in the original foliage. It's like eating the leaves right off 
the tree¿ just less crunchy!

Because straight Matcha is a little bitter, we couldn't resist adding some milk and cane sugar to our mix. Com-
bine three tablespoons of the powder to 6 ounces of hot water and you'll have before you a creamy, sweetened 
brew with authentic, Green Tea flavor. Perfect for your next Japanese St. Patrick's Day tea party.

Our 8-ounce can is $3.99 and makes four 12-ounce lattes. That's about the same you'd pay for just a single latte 
at your local café.

"Imagine, for a moment, that it's a hot summer day. The sky is clear, the sun is blazing overhead, and you have 
an ice-cold glass of tea with lemon keeping you cool. Now imagine that all it took to get that drink into your 
hand was to place a tea bag into a glass of water. No kettles, no boiling water, no squeezing lemons, not even 
mixing pre-prepared iced tea and lemon juice together-just plopping a tea bag into water, and waiting. Well,

In what might be the quickest, most convenient, most cost-effective way to cool down ever, our specially 
formulated Cold Brew Iced Tea bags need only to be placed in water, where they'll brew, totally on their own, 
into a classically crisp and citric iced tea combo. The bags are shelf stable, meaning you can keep them on

"Along the western edge of Uganda, the snow-capped Rwenzori Mountains inspire such awe that many refer 
to them as the legendary ""Mountains of the Moon."" The snowpack from their peaks nourishes the soil of the 
foothills below, offering the perfect growing conditions for fine-quality Arabica coffee beans-e.g., the coffee 
beans you'll find inside this bag. 

The latest in our ever-evolving, limited-edition Small Lot Coffee series, Trader Joe's Uganda Rwenzori 
Mountains of the Moon Coffee is grown, harvested, and sun-dried by local farmers. Our supplier then treats 
the beans to a medium roast, which brings out the coffee's natural notes of strawberry, chocolate, and dried 
black currants. Brew a cup per your favorite coffee-making method, then enjoy it alongside a hearty granola 
parfait for breakfast or a few TJ's Raspberry Hearts shortbread cookies [sku 58408] for dessert.

"The simple act of brewing a cup of morning coffee can provide a moment of culinary Zen-a quiet and creative 
start to one's day, before the flurry of mundane and required tasks kick in. But for those in a rush, this kind of 
ceremonial coffee prep at daybreak is pure fantasy. 

While Trader Joe's may not be able to guarantee daily moments of peaceful meditation around the coffee pot, 
we are doing our part to simplify your coffee making process¿ Our whole bean, Joe Medium Roast Coffee [sku 
93015] has been a customer favorite since it first arrived, and now, for those seeking to minimize their morning 
rush, we're introducing Joe Medium Roast Ground Coffee.
 
Joe Medium Roast is that no frills, exceptionally smooth, cup of joe. We heat a blend of 100% Arabica beans 
from South America to a medium-roast profile-that place where drinkability, smoothness, and enjoyability 
meet. Then, we grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-
freshness canister. This means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into 
your coffeemaker. No noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we 
still recommend approximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water.

If you already enjoy the whole bean version, and are looking for new ways to simplify your morning routine, 
switching to Joe Medium Roast Ground Coffee is an easy step in the right direction. And, it's easy on your 
budget, too, since it comes in the same size canister as the whole-bean version, for exactly the same price. That's 
$4.99 for 14 ounces.

"One of the more than 13,000 islands that form Indonesia, Sumatra leads the country's coffee production. 
Divided by the volcanic Barisan mountain range that is greater than 12,400 feet at its peak, the topography and 
humid climate are well suited for coffee cultivation.

Small family farmers grow the 100% Arabica beans for Trader Joe's Fair Trade Organic Sumatra Coffee 
among fruit trees in the northern region of the island. The beans are picked, washed, and pulped by hand, 
using the distinctive ""wet-hulling"" process. This unique production method, known in Indonesia as Giling 
Basah, contributes to the signature characteristics of Sumatra coffee: full bodied, lower acidity, and  bold, 
earthy flavors. The beans are given a medium-dark roast to accentuate tasting notes of dried fruit and molasses 
in every sip. 

Not only can a cup of Trader Joe's Fair Trade Organic Sumatra positively impact the start of your day, because 
of it's Fair Trade certification, each bag supports small farmers through fair prices. So, go ahead, brew yourself 
a mug-it works exceptionally well with drip, pour over, French press, and espresso brewing methods.

"Located on the southeastern edge of Ecuador, at the very edge of the Amazon Basin, the province of Zamora 
Chinchipe is famed for its awe-inspiring natural beauty. Tourists from all around the globe come to experience 
its enchanting flora, unique fauna, and utterly majestic waterfalls, flowing freely from the Andean highlands. 
Up in those mountains, one can also find communities of coffee growers, utilizing the region's high elevations 
and tropical climate to cultivate lush, full-flavored coffee beans-just like what you'll find in every bag of 
Trader Joe's Zamora Ecuador Small Lot Coffee.

Hand-picked, sun-dried, and medium roasted, these Zamora Ecuador beans brew into a fantastically full-
bodied coffee, replete with notes of warm molasses, rich dark chocolate, and nimbly spicy nutmeg. This bold 
flavor profile, combined with a relatively low level of acidity, makes it an able companion to all kinds of breakfast 
and brunch fare, like cheesy, herby omelettes, saucy huevos rancheros, and well-dressed avocado toasts. For a 
special treat, we recommend pairing it up with something sweet that has a slightly savory edge to interact with 
the darker flavors in each sip-our Sea Salt Brownie Bites [sku 74143], for example, will do wonderfully.

"A cup of hot cocoa feels like being home for the holidays. Everything from the warmth of the mug in your 
hands, to the welcoming aroma of the rich, delicious chocolate, to the delicate sweetness in every sip, evokes 
that feeling of being comfy-cozy with loved ones during the height of winter. That's precisely why, during these 
chilly winter months, we offer Trader Joe's Organic Hot Cocoa Mix, an elegantly effortless way to bring this 
indelible experience to you and yours this holiday season.

Unlike other, overly sweet cocoa mixes we've encountered, this Mix strikes a careful balance between sweet and 
chocolatey, and carries it all with a delectably smooth mouthfeel. It's made with all-organic ingredients, and 
includes dried organic milk, so that all that's needed on your end is hot water. We find that the best water-to-
mix ratio for a full-flavored cup of Cocoa is eight ounces hot water per one envelope of Mix, and we especially 
like it when it's topped with a handful of Mini Marshmallows [sku 57620] or a dollop of whipped cream.

supposed to do when strength is in order, but a stimulant sounds¿ excessive? Simple - sip a cup of Trader

a gentle, water-based decaffeination process, so while the caffeine is removed, the flavor and integrity of the

"Back by popular demand, Trader Joe's Gingerbread Coffee is our ode to winter. We start with a quality 
blend of 100% arabica beans from Colombia and Mexico that are roasted to a medium-dark Vienna roast.  
Then we spike the blend with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice and ginger. We grind the beans and spices 
together, which adds dynamic aroma and flavor to the coffee. It makes a cup of coffee that drinks like a 
freshly baked piece of gingerbread - as delicious and heartwarming as it sounds. The spices are just right, 
zingy but not too overpowering.

"Decaf, Delish, Desired

Back in 2009, we introduced our Decaffeinated Candy Cane Green Tea to significantly stronger customer 
response than anticipated. In other words, we ran out. Really quickly. And you were sad. And so were we. 
And so, we brought in more, and we sold more. Four years later, it continues to be a highly anticipated 
Trader Joe's holiday product.

What's so special about this tea? It's just really good. Naturally decaffeinated green tea, spiked with 
peppermint - except for its lack of red and white stripes and impossible-to-remove wrapper, this tea is 
astonishingly evocative of an actual candy cane. Served hot or cold, it's soothing and satisfying.

Trader Joe's Decaffeinated Candy Cane Green Tea also makes a great gift. You can add it to a gift basket 
or pop it in a stocking. Buy some for yourself and give the adorable, polar-bear-adorned box to your kids 
- kids always like the box more than what comes inside, you know. Our price of $1.99 for a box of 20 tea 
bags is the same as it was in 2009, making this a great value, yet again.",93461,,20 Bag,,Candy Cane Green Tea,2.79,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/candy-cane-green-tea-093461,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Candy Cane Green Tea"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":194,""name"":""Coffee & Tea"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Candy Cane Decaffeinated Green Tea\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/93461.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":20,""sales_uom_description"":""Bag"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":2.79,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Chance of Rain"",""Cold Front"",""Fall Faves"",""Giftable"",""Merry-making"",""Rain or Shine"",""Rise & Shine""],""item_characteristics"":[""Kosher""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"While it's generally accepted that the Mayans were the first to make a beverage out of chocolate, this drink 
bore little resemblance to what we now know as hot chocolate.  It was spicy and bitter and definitely an ac-
quired taste. Over time, adventurous aristocrats (chocolate was very  expensive) added spices to ty to make 
the drink more enjoyable. It's the seventeenth century Europeans, historically speaking, who get the credit for 
adding sugar to this bitter concoction, making it eminently more palatable and desirable.

With the introduction of Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Flavored Hot Cocoa, we'll humbly take the credit for 
making this classic beverage even more palatable and desirable. We've taken traditional hot cocoa mix - you 
know, one that's rich and creamy and sweet and incredibly delicious in every way - and added natural cara-
mel flavor, so that every sip delivers the enhanced richness and sweetness of caramel. But we didn't stop there. 
Nope. We went all the way in, adding salt to the caramel flavor, so that the final result, when mixed with hot 
water or milk, is the warm, liquid manifestation of our ever-popular Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramels [sku 
90845]. A single sip simply wouldn't suffice, so a single scoop makes a nice-sized mug of salty, caramely, 
chocolately deliciousness.

We're selling each 10 ounce canister of Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Flavored Hot Cocoa for $3.99, with 
about eight servings per canister, throughout the cold-weather months. You'll find it with our other hot cocoa 
offerings.

"""Some people will tell you there is a great deal of poetry and ¿ ne sentiment in a chest of tea."" 
          -Ralph Waldo Emerson

With this wisdom from Emerson in mind, we set out to develop a ¿ awless fall tea bursting with ""poetry and 
¿ ne sentiment."" Tasseographists would say that this tea we developed foretells leaves falling, apple picking, wind 
whistling, and ¿ re crackling. You don't need to be adept at reading leaves to decipher that harvest memories are 
made in Trader Joe's Harvest Blend Herbal Tea. 

With aromatic bursts of cinnamon and ginger, an abundance of apple ¿ avor and a sweet-spicy lingering ¿ nish, 
Trader Joe's Harvest Blend Herbal Tea delivers a season's-worth of experiences in a sip. Don't let that stop you 
from seeking out those experiences yourself, though. In fact, we encourage it! Brew a cup and head out to the 
pumpkin patch or take a walk in the brisk fall weather. Naturally ca¿ eine free, it invigorates the senses with 
vibrant apple aromas and soothes both stomach and soul with rich, ginger-cinnamon warmth.

A must-have this autumn, you'll ¿ nd this on our shelves only for a limited time. Our Harvest Blend Tea is easy 
to fall for, especially at $1.99 for each foxy box of 20 tea bags.",51424,,20 Bag,,Harvest Blend Herbal Tea,2.49,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/harvest-blend-herbal-tea-051424,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Harvest Blend Herbal Tea"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":194,""name"":""Coffee & Tea"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Harvest Blend Herbal Tea\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/51424.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":20,""sales_uom_description"":""Bag"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":2.49,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Desk Drawer"",""Fall Faves"",""Glass Half Full"",""Rain or Shine"",""Rise & Shine"",""Welcoming""],""item_characteristics"":[""Kosher""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"All of our limited-edition, whole-bean Small Lot Coffees are special in some way, and Trader Joe's Arroyo 
Bonito Estate Dominican Republic Coffee is no exception. As its name would suggest, the beans come to us 
from the Arroyo Bonito Estate, located at about 4,500 feet above sea level in the D.R.'s mountainous, central 
region. There, the coffee plants thrive in the fertile mountain soil, under a canopy of pine, macadamia, and 
guava trees. 

The farm is owned and operated by a family with over 30 years of coffee cultivation experience who-following 
their own unique, natural, wine-like process-allow the beans to over-ripen just a bit before harvest, resulting 
in a higher sugar concentration. The sweet, coffee cherries are dried in the sun for 21 days, then milled very 
slowly to thoroughly crack the outer husks. Finally, they're set aside to ""rest"" an additional 30 days before being 
sent stateside to be roasted. The whole process yields a well-balanced cup of 100% Arabica, medium-roast 
coffee with a nice ""wine-y"" taste and notes of dried cherry, raisin, and plum. 

We're selling Trader Joe's Arroyo Bonito Estate Small Lot Coffee in 12-ounce bags for $9.99 each. Grab some

"In this seemingly unassuming bag of Coffee, you will find an extraordinary blend of two unique whole, 100% 
Arabica coffee bean varietals. Grown in Nicaragua, the Maragogype (pronounced ma-ra-go-hee-peh ) coffee 
bean is considered rare and is known as ""elephant bean"" on account of its noticeably large size. These beans 
make a remarkably smooth and gently sweet cup of coffee. They're given a light roast to draw out a natural 
sweetness that lends itself to an easy-drinking coffee with notes of honey and caramel. And from the Santa Ana 
region of El Salvador, the Pacamara (a hybrid of Pacas and Maragogype varietals) bean is grown in volcanic 
soil. This attribute helps yield full flavors and floral aromas like orange, jasmine, and chocolate that really make 
this medium roast shine! 

Trader Joe's Select Harvest Curated Coffee 50/50 Blend of El Salvador Pacamara & Nicaragua Maragogype 
can be ground and brewed to fit your morning coffee routine. It yields a magnificent cup whether you use 
a drip or pour over method, a French press, or an espresso machine. Give it a try with a warm Chocolate 
Croissant [sku 73162] or a slice of Cinnamon Coffee Cake [sku 94235] for breakfast or dessert. This exquisitely 
Curated Coffee is only available for a limited time, so stop by your neighborhood Trader Joe's for a bag today.

"Colombia's famed Popayan region is home to the Supremo Arabica beans found within each 28-ounce canister 
of Trader Joe's Colombia Supremo Coffee. Supremo beans are larger and more flavorful than other Colombian 
beans making them the most prized and desirable of the South American nation's coffee crop. Otherwise 
speaking, these are some supremely satisfying beans.

Medium roasted for a balance of sweet and rich classic coffee aromas and flavor. While an accessible roast, 
indeed, this is no garden variety can of beans. We take pride in distilling a balanced blend of acidity and 
smoothness into each batch of Columbia Supremo Coffee beans. And with 100% arabica whole beans filling 
each nitrogen flushed canister, we bring them in the freshest fashion available to our stores and you. With 
classic coffee notes of caramel and chocolate, waking up with a cup of Trader Joe's Colombia Supremo Coffee 
should be the first thing you check off of your to-do list every morning.

"Trader Joe's Mango Black Tea has been gracing our coffee & tea section for more than nine years, lifetimes 
in Trader Joe's years. What is it that makes Mango Black Tea such a stalwart on our shelves? It's just delicious. 
But why is it delicious? That's all about what's inside each tempting tea bag. 

Our Mango Black Tea supplier sources full-flavored black teas from some of the world's best tea-growing 
regions - central Africa; Assam, India; and Indonesia. Each of these regions produces teas that convey differ-
ent characteristics; bright & invigorating (central Africa), robust & malty (Assam), hearty & medium-bodied 
(Indonesia). Combined, they create a flavor profile that delivers well-rounded flavors for a lively, bright, and 
balanced cup. Then, of course, there's the mango. Here, our supplier has employed natural mango flavor, 
imparting a hint of the tropics without making the tea overwhelmingly fruity. As we said earlier, it's just deli-
cious. Serve it hot or cold (we recommend steeping it hot before icing for best results) - it's mango-licious 
either way!

We're selling each box of 20 tea bags for $1.99, every day (the same price it's been since its introduction), a 
price as delicious as the Tea itself.",83495,,20 Bag,,Mango Black Tea,2.49,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/mango-black-tea-083495,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Mango Black Tea"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":194,""name"":""Coffee & Tea"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Mango Black Tea\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/83495.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":20,""sales_uom_description"":""Bag"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":2.49,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Brunch All Day"",""Glass Half Full"",""Rise & Shine""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"Fixing up that first cup of coffee is often an essential part of the morning routine. For many, in fact, it's what 
marks the actual beginning of the day. But when time is in short supply, it can be quite a challenge to get 
that routine up and running - doubly so if you prefer to drink decaf. That's why Trader Joe's Decaf French 
Roast Instant Coffee is so handy: all it takes is a cup of hot water and a second or two of stirring to start your 
morning (or whenever you take your decaf) with all the rich aromas and dark, toasty flavors of a classic cup of 
French roast - minus the caffeine, of course.

With a just-like-fresh-brewed flavor that must be tasted to be believed, our Decaf French Roast Instant Coffee 
doesn't just save you time, it's also a tremendous help when traveling, camping, or in any other circumstance 
where you won't have immediate access to a coffee machine. And since it's decidedly decaffeinated, it makes 
a great option for serving with dessert (especially when paired up with something like a Chocolate Lava Cake 
[sku 01070]). We even find it makes a great ingredient in a dessert: try using an egg beater to mix a tablespoon 
or two with equal parts sugar and water until fluffy, then serving atop a glass of chilled milk for an easy decaf 
dalgona coffee.

"Moroccan mint tea is not so much a drink as it is a ritual, a sign of hospitality, an event in which to partake. In 
Morocco, hosts, shop owners, and teahouses take great care in the process of brewing mint tea and serving it to 
anyone who walks through their doors. Tea is cleansed in boiling water before steeping, with mint leaves and 
sugar added to yield a sweet, flavorful drink. Such great care yields spectacular tea. Tea that we, in turn, wanted 
you to experience, too. 

With Trader Joe's Organic Moroccan Mint Tea, we've simplified a few of the accustomed brewing steps, de-
livering full flavor in the handy form of a tea bag. Our supplier first sources organic spearmint from the Pacific 
Northwest-because mint tea isn't complete without some of the finest mint leaves around. Organic lemon-
grass-which adds a bit of zest-and organic green tea from South India complete the trifecta of ingredients 
inspired by traditional Maghrebi mint tea. 

When brewed, this tea is delightful, refreshing, and oh-so minty. If you'd like to achieve the time-honored sweet 
tea served in Morocco, add a heaping spoonful of Organic Sugar [sku 27042] to your mug immediately after 
steeping the tea. You won't regret it. Of course, our Organic Moroccan Mint Tea isn't just limited to tradition. 
Serve over ice with a sprig of mint for a refreshing drink on warmer days. 

Each 1.27 ounce box of 20 Trader Joe's Organic Moroccan Mint tea bags is only $2.49. That's 19 bags to brew 
for guests! Or 20 all for yourself. Or if you buy two boxes you can have your tea and be hospitable too¿

"The use of turmeric [too-mer-ick] is on the rise. This rhizome (underground, rooted stem) is in the ginger fam-
ily-and looks it, too, except for the striking orange color beneath its skin. 

Mix turmeric with cousin ginger and put it in in curries or in your grilled chicken rub, and you'll get an invigo-
rating, fragrant, (brightly colored) result. Mix turmeric with ginger and put it in hot water, and you'll get the 
invigorating and fragrant Trader Joe's Ginger Turmeric Herbal Tea.  

Actually, it's not tea, per se-since there are no leaves of a tea plant in these steeping bags. Steeped in hot water, 
our bags produce a ""tisane,"" aka an ""herbal infusion""; what most people (not to mention we) call Herbal Tea. 
Now, since we are being completely thorough, we should also mention that our Ginger Turmeric Tea is signifi-
cantly more than just ginger and turmeric. It also incorporates licorice root, orange peel, orange oil, and black 
pepper-all of which are 100% organic, as a matter of fact.

By placing one ""tea bag"" (there are 20 in the box) in an eight ounce cup and adding boiling water, you're making 
a caffeine-free beverage that is ready to sip in 3-5 minutes. The ginger will revitalize, while the turmeric awakens 
with its aromatic quality. Sound inviting? Then, we invite you to experience a cup for yourself. Each 1.6 ounce 
box of 20 Organic Ginger Turmeric Herbal Tea bags is $2.49. Find it now in our stores, among our wide selec-
tion of teas and tisanes.

"There are few things as steadfast, unfailing, and, some might argue, as necessary as a morning cup o' joe. Or, 
should we say, a morning cup of Joe. Yes, that's more like it. At Trader Joe's, we take coffee quite seriously, 
which is why we sell such a wide array of the stuff-a panoply of perking agents, if you will. In the last several 
years, our revolving roster of Trader Joe's Small Lot Coffees has begun to take center stage, and while we love this 
limited-edition line-up (we wouldn't offer it if we didn't), we're the first to admit that sometimes, it's a no-frills, 
old-fashioned cup of coffee you crave. 

For fifteen years and counting, customers have looked to TJ's Medium Roast Joe to provide said cup. In more recent 
years, however, more and more of you have expresso-ed a desire for an organic version of this time-honored, TJ's 
classic. Well, dear customers, your wish is our command: introducing Trader Joe's Organic Medium Roast 
Joe. Yup, it's the same bright, balanced 100% Arabica blend you love, made with organically grown Colombian, 
Honduran, and Indonesian beans. Sounds like a darn good deal, right? Plus, this Joe comes as Ground Coffee, 
so there's no noisy coffee grinder disturbing the peace and much less counter mess. Top o' the morning to ya!

"Coffee isn't just a beverage. It's a fuel, an essential part of one's morning ritual. And while it's nice to be able to 
revel in that ritual, the reality is that we can't always take the time to slowly brew a cup in quiet contemplation. 
Sometimes, we just need a cup of coffee, even when we don't have access to a coffee machine. For mornings and 
moments like that, we have Trader Joe's 100% Colombian Instant Coffee.

Ever been curious how Instant Coffee is made? It's less complex than it seems: first, our supplier brews up a big 
batch of coffee using 100% Colombian coffee beans, then sprays a mist of that coffee into an environment that's 
been made super hot and super dry. By the time the mist settles onto the ground, the droplets dry into tiny 
crystals that can then be reconstituted into liquid coffee via the reintroduction of hot water. What that means 
for you is that each cup of our 100% Colombian Instant Coffee has all the earthiness and invigorating flavor 
of a pot of drip coffee - because that's precisely what it is! 

Pleasantly roasted, perfectly mild, and wildly convenient (especially for traveling), Trader Joe's 100% 
Colombian Instant Coffee is also a genuine everyday value: you can find 3.5-ounce jars at your local Trader 
Joe's for $3.99*.

"Oh, the weather outside is wintry. For most of the country, that means cold and snow (and even if it doesn't, 
you'll still like where this is going). We can't think of a better way to cure those winter chills than with a steaming 
cup of Trader Joe's Wintry Blend Coffee. 

With the holidays upon us, Wintry Blend is the ideal coffee to warm you from the inside out amidst the hustle 
and bustle of the season. It's a blend of quality Arabica coffee from South America. (We could tell you exactly 
which countries, but that might just give away the secret to our blend, and well, we like to keep secrets). The 
beans are roasted to a smooth, medium-dark Vienna roast. But since this is no everyday coffee, we didn't stop 
there. We added whole green and red peppercorns, fresh whole cloves, and chunks of sweet cinnamon. The 
coffee isn't flavored-rather, it's spiked with spices. Finally, we've ground the beans to make prep a snap, and to 
ensure the spices are evenly distributed throughout-this way, you end up with perfectly spiced Wintry Blend 
Coffee in every cup.

When we first introduced this seasonal brew back in 2005, we were proud to offer it for the great price of $6.99. 
And because our buyers work diligently to maintain prices consistent with coffee market, we are proud to still 
offer another season of our Wintry Blend Coffee for the great price of $6.99 for each 14-ounce can. The gift of 
great value never gets old.",81829,,14 Oz,,Wintry Blend Ground Coffee,8.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/wintry-blend-ground-coffee-081829,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Wintry Blend Ground Coffee"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":194,""name"":""Coffee & Tea"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Wintry Blend Ground Coffee\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m304/81829.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":14,""sales_uom_description"":""Oz"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":8.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Cold Front"",""Merry-making"",""Rise & Shine"",""Welcoming""],""item_characteristics"":[""Kosher""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"A perfect autumn morning calls for a perfect autumn drink, and for our money, nothing fits that bill quite like 
our new, delightfully unique Maple Espresso Black Tea Blend. Made with a blend of select black & herbal tea 
leaves, natural maple flavor, and ground espresso beans, a steaming mug of this Tea is just the thing to help turn 
a perfect autumn morning into a perfect autumn day.

That said, this sensory synthesis of aromatic tea, bold espresso, and sweet maple need not be strictly relegated 
to the morning. On the contrary, we find it particularly suited for making iced lattes and milk teas, too - two 
great options for an autumn afternoon pick-me-up. Hot, iced, or mixed with milk (or your favorite non-dairy 
alternative), Trader Joe's Maple Espresso Black Tea Blend sets a new standard for seasonal drinks. At $2.69 
for a 1.2-ounce box (each box containing 20 teabags), we think it sets a pretty spectacular standard for value, 
too. While supplies last, you can find it in our coffee & tea section.

"First invented in late 19th century Italy, espresso's introduction to the coffee scene was nothing if not a game-
changer. Its rich, plush texture and gloriously concentrated flavor profile made it a darling of café-goers the 
world over, and by the 1950s, it became a household name. In keeping with its innovative roots, Trader Joe's 
Italian Roast Ground Espresso Coffee is a game-changer, too. Made with 100% Arabica beans that have been 
roasted to a warm, toasty medium dark, then ground to a super-fine espresso grade, this coffee's full body, 
balanced acidity, and extended, earthy finish can be enjoyed as an espresso shot, a full-flavored pour-over, or a 
simply delicious cup of drip coffee, all with equal delight.

Our supplier, a fourth generation coffee roaster from espresso's original homeland of Italy, recommends a 
simple ratio of 1 ounce of cold water to 1 Tbsp of Ground Espresso when using an espresso machine, and a 
ratio of 6 ounces cold water to 2 Tbsp grounds when making drip coffee. Once brewed, this Coffee is rich and 
captivatingly aromatic, a natural companion to breakfast baked goods like flaky crossaints or buttery scones. 
Looking for a way to change the game even further? Try mixing a shot with hot water for an easy, at-home 
Americano, or steamed milk for a quick Cortado.

"100% Brazil Cerrado Arabica beans are roasted to a medium-dark, Vienna-style and then spiked with actual 
spices and seasonings - things like orange peel, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla beans, and pumpkin spice 
oil. The beans and the spices are ground together, so the flavors have time to merge, mingle and marry. Brewed 
and black, its flavor is smooth and subtly spiced. If you add milk and sugar, those pined-for pumpkin spice 
flavors are amplified.

We first introduced Trader Joe's Pumpkin Spice Coffee in 2011, and it has returned each year since for 
Pumpkin Season. For us, it's a reminder that life's simple pleasures can be the most important - a good cup of

"Trader Joe's has become known for our great selection of coffees. We've got beans to brew from around the 
world, and coffee for every occasion. Our Pumpkin Spice Coffee Cups are well suited for autumnal occasions, 
especially those moments when you don't need a whole pot.

Like our Medium Roast Coffee Cups [sku 51032], our French Roast Coffee Cups [sku 53121], and our Coffee 
Cup Quintet [sku 53642], these Pumpkin Spice Coffee Cups are made expressly for your Keurig K-Cup® Coffee 
Maker. Little single serving pods that fit in your Keurig are filled with Trader Joe's Pumpkin Spice Coffee. Each 
pod is nitrogen flushed and individually sealed for freshness in a clear package. Our pods also have a unique mesh 
system, which allows you see the grounds and catch the aroma of cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice, 
the very moment you open the package.

Each pod yields one regular serving of hot Pumpkin Spice Coffee. Every sip tastes like pumpkin pie-and cof-
fee, too! If you are in a dessert mood, drop a dollop of whipped cream into your steaming mug to complete the 
holiday-pie illusion. 

It's easy. It's fast. It's 100% recyclable. You get 12 pods (yielding 12 cups of coffee) for $4.49. If our calculations 
are correct, that's just $0.37 per cup. Find a café, or even a diner, serving coffee at that price! Even if you do, 
you'll still be missing the quality of Trader Joe's 100% Arabica Coffee and the alluring aroma of the season we've 
captured here.

"The latest entry into our Small Lot Coffee series takes us to the Kintamani region of Bali, where the rich, 
volcanic soils (courtesy of nearby Mt. Batur) and warm climate create an ideal environment for growing bold, 
flavorful coffee beans. Here, in the lush, humid highlands, farmers hand-pick coffee cherries and wet-process 
them using the traditional giling basah method, where hulls are removed before the beans are completely dried, 
resulting in a stronger body and relatively reduced acidity. It all makes for a deliciously unique (and uniquely 
delicious) cup of coffee that could only come from Kintamani. In other words, everything a Trader Joe's Small 
Lot Coffee should be.

With its medium dark roast and balanced profile of orange peel, dried fruit, and warm vanilla, Trader Joe's  
Kintamani Small Lot Coffee is perfect for serving with sweet, fruit-forward pastries and hearty breakfast 
foods. Each sip starts with a spicy, almost peppery note, which is intercepted by the coffee's balanced acidity, and 
eventually flows into a gentle, vanilla-tinged finish. It all makes for a smooth, yet bold, start to your morning, 
but be warned, if you want a chance to enjoy it, act soon. Like all Trader Joe's Small Lot Coffees, supplies are 
decidedly limited.

"When it comes to brewing, what's the difference between hot and cold? Yes, temperature, of course, but 
also bite. Cold brewed coffee is never heated. As a result, the oils and acids that are released commonly with 
heat, don't pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its famous bitter 
bite, the nuanced lush, fruity flavors of the beans becomes strikingly more perceptible and, some would 
argue, more enjoyable. With more than 50% less acid than a hot brewed cup, cold brew is truly smooth.

Cold brewing is hot.  While we're pro-DIY, the actual percolation and filtration can take somewhere 
between 12-24 hours. Don't know about you, but our cup of coffee can't always wait, so; we bottled it! 
Working with craft coffee roasters in Texas, we start with a half a pound, medium roast, 100% Arabica beans 
from the world's finest growing regions. The beans are ground coarsely and specially filtered to create 32 
ounces of delicious, naturally sweet, ready-to-pour Trader Joe's Cold Brewed Coffee Concentrate. That's 
equivalent to about 96 ounces of coffee beverages when reconstituted with water, milk, etc. If you like it 
strong and steamy, mix it with a bit of hot water for a smooth cup. Or pour it over some ice for a cold cold 
brew. If you want to keep the coffee as concentrated as possible, you can use it to make coffee ice cubes for 
your iced coffee. And since it's ideal for adding coffee flavor without the acid bitterness, it's even great for 
use in baking, marinating, making cocktails or served Affogato-style over ice cream. We're selling each 32 
ounce container of Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate for $7.99, which is equal to about 66¢ a cup!

"It's time to wake up and smell the coffee. Literally. We named this particular blend of beans Organic Fair Trade 
Wake Up Blend Coffee for a reason-several reasons, actually-but perhaps most important is the fact that this 
is an ideal coffee to greet both your olfactory and gustatory senses first thing in the morning.

Wake Up Blend is a mix of organically grown, fair trade certified, 100% Arabica beans from small-scale farms 
in Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Peru. The farmers who grow these beans are committed to organic and 
sustainable agricultural practices. They're also committed to cultivating truly excellent coffee beans! These high 
quality beans are given a medium roast to bring out their best flavors, yielding a smooth, well-balanced cup 
with bright acidity and just a touch of inherent sweetness. 

As a bonus, we've also given these beans a medium grind. This means that waking up to the aroma and flavor 
of Trader Joe's Organic Fair Trade Wake Up Blend is easier than ever!

Since 2011, we've offered our Wake Up Blend in whole-bean form [sku 98530]. That large, 28-ounce canister is

"Tea is important in Japan. It's at the center of communal life, providing a key ritual (literally) around which 
friends can gather. Each fleeting meeting is viewed as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and thus, deeply 
cherished. The common Japanese idiom, Ichi-go, Ichi-e (meaning, ""one time, one meeting"") provides the perfect 
description of this treasured tea time.

We resonate with this value for meaningful human interaction-just visualize your last interaction with one of 
our friendly Crew! So, we're doing our part to help facilitate more such meetings among friends. Toward that 
end, we think our new Matcha Green Tea is a great start. It's hard to find time to slow down and taste the tea 
in your busy routine, but these individual packets of real Matcha Green Tea provide an easy way to brew an 
authentic, quality cup-anytime, anywhere. 

Our vibrant emerald-green tea powder comes from tea leaves that are grown and ground for us in Japan. Brewed, 
it has a rich taste that presents a delicate hint of sweetness. Each 1.5 gram packet (there are seven in the box) is 
the perfect amount to mix with eight ounces of hot water for a steaming cup of Matcha... better make it two! 
Ichi-go, Ichi-e. For cold tea on-the-go, you can simply pour a packet into a water bottle (filled with cold water), 
replace the cap, and shake until blended. 

Per packet, there are zero grams of fat, zero grams of cholesterol, and only five calories. And per packet, you're 
paying less than a dollar since the entire 10.5 gram box of seven is $6.99. If you've been looking for a good 
excuse to come together, look no further than Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea!

Peaberry coffee is a rarity, occurring in only about 5-10% of a harvest. Most coffee cherries contain two seeds, 
or beans. Rarely, only one bean develops within the cherry - that bean grows larger and rounder than its two-
beans-in-a-cherry counterparts - and develops distinctive flavors. Together in Trader Joe's Select Harvest 
50/50 Peaberry Coffee, the Colombian and Tanzanian beans combine to form a well-balanced blend that 
delivers full, richly-flavored coffee in every cup.

"Rooibos (most commonly pronounced ROY-boss) is unique among teas. For one thing, it's not technically 
""tea,"" at all. Rather, it's a tisane, made from the leaves of a bush that only grows in certain coastal shrublands 
near the Cape of South Africa. For another, it has a one-of-a-kind earthy, full-bodied, and elegantly aromatic 
profile, and just happens to contain no caffeine, too. Inspired and shaped by that uniqueness, Trader Joe's 
Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend plays to rooibos's natural strengths by adding in a blend of 
dried hibiscus, rose hips, orange peel, and a bit of orange oil to give a decidedly citric, tantalizingly tangy, and 
remarkably refreshing character.

Because of its lack of caffeine, our Organic Blood Orange Rooibos Tea makes an excellent choice for drinking 
anytime throughout the day, but we find its toasty orange peel edge is particularly great for sipping during the 
evening. Similarly, its natural juiciness and smooth profile lends itself to being served iced, or even brewed 
cold. Being the unique grocery store that we are, we're selling 1.13-ounce boxes of Trader Joe's Organic Blood 
Orange Rooibos Herbal Tea Blend for $2.49*, every day - substantially less than what you'd pay for organic 
rooibos elsewhere. Look for them in our coffee and tea section.

"Boy, oh boy, are our customers crazy for cold brew - and why shouldn' t they be? As its name implies, cold 
brew coffee is brewed with cold water (rather than hot water), so some of the heat-activated oils and acids 
inherent in the coffee don't pass through to the brew. No longer masked by the compounds that give coffee its 
famous, bitter bite, the nuanced flavors of the beans become strikingly more perceptible. 

With around 50% less acid than a hot water-brewed cup of coffee, cold brew is truly smooth, but the brewing 
process can be a hassle. Luckily, Trader Joe's Cold Brew Coffee Bags make crafting the perfect cold brew an 
absolute cinch. Picture giant tea bags - only instead of tea, they're filled with 100% Arabica medium-roast 
coffee, grown in Tanzania at the base Mt. Kilimanjaro. Simply toss two Bags into a pitcher with 7 cups of cold 
water, let it steep in the fridge overnight (8-12 hours), and say good morning to a bright, smooth glass of Cold 
Brew, complete with subtle, complex notes of berries and molasses! 

We're selling each 8.5-ounce resealable bag of four Cold Brew Coffee Bags for $5.99. Two Bags yield seven 
8-fl. oz cups of Cold Brew, so if you do the math, that's about 43¢ per ice-cold, refreshing cup! Quite a bargain 
when you consider that an 8-ounce cup of identically-brewed Cold Brew will set you back at least $2.50 at your 
local coffee joint. Great coffee at a great price, available only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"The simple act of brewing a cup of morning coffee can provide a moment of culinary Zen-a quiet and creative 
start to one's day, before the flurry of mundane and required tasks kick in. But for those in a rush, this kind of 
ceremonial coffee prep at daybreak is pure fantasy. 

While Trader Joe's may not be able to guarantee daily moments of peaceful meditation around the coffee pot, 
we are doing our part to simplify your coffee making process with our newest addition to our Joe line of coffees, 
Trader Joe's Joe Light Roast Ground Coffee. It's a full-flavored and easy-going coffee, sold pre-ground to help 
those seeking to minimize their morning rush.

We start with a blend of 100% Arabica beans from Guatemala and Ethiopia and heat them to an ideal light roast 
profile: pleasantly light brown in color, mellow aromatics, and roast just enough to bring out the full body and 
fruitiness of the Ethiopian beans without sacrificing the acidity and sweet notes of the Guatemalan. Then, we 
grind the beans so you won't have to, just before sealing them into our nitrogen-flushed-for-freshness bag. This 
means, at home you'll be able to open the top and immediately spoon fresh grounds into your coffeemaker. No 
noisy grinder disturbing the peace, and much less counter mess. For the perfect cup, we still recommend ap-
proximately two tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of cold water.

All in all, it adds up to a no frills, thoroughly satisfying, easy-to-make cup of joe. And at $3.99 for a 14-ounce 
bag, it adds up to a pretty great value, too. You'll find Joe Light Roast Ground Coffee in our coffee section, pre-
ground and ready to bring a little more peace to your morning grind.

"Full of warm, fragrant spices and nose-tingling ginger, nothing perks up a morning or slows the pace of a hectic 
afternoon like a spiced chai latte. But the number of ingredients required to create such a concoction from 
scratch can be daunting. Enter Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate, the next evolution in our 
concentrated, caffeinated, bottled beverage set (see TJ's Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate, Coconut Cold Brew 
Coffee Concentrate, etc.).

Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black Tea Concentrate is brewed with filtered water and steeped in small batches to 
fully develop its characteristic flavors-namely, allspice, black pepper, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and ginger. 
As chai blends can vary depending on who's doing the blending, we've specifically chosen to highlight ginger in 
our Black Tea Concentrate. This robust rundown of redolent spices is combined with sugar to create the ideal 
base for a perfectly perfumed, satisfyingly sweet, and altogether tasty Spiced Chai latte.

This is where you come in: to create the creamiest Spiced Chai latte at home, simply mix two parts of your 
chosen base (milk or non-dairy beverage) with one part Black Tea Concentrate and give it a stir. That's it! No 
fussing with sweetener, no waiting for a proper steep-just pour, stir, and serve. If you're in need of an extra jolt, 
throw a shot of espresso in the mix to really shake things up.

We're offering 16 fluid-ounce bottles (enough to make four 12-ounce cups) of Trader Joe's Spiced Chai Black 
Tea Concentrate for $2.49-that boils down to about 62¢ per cup! Find them steeped in value with the other 
teas at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"Matcha: it's so hot right now. Some might even say that a certain matcha madness has descended upon popular 
culture as we know it. This finely ground powder made from specially-grown green tea leaves has made its 
way into all kinds of goodies these days, mostly desserts. But while matcha makes a delicious ice cream flavor 
and a tempting addition to cookies, cakes, and candies, it's also just as enjoyable in its originally intended 
form: tea. Enter: Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea.

We recently started carrying Matcha Green Tea [sku 57159] in powder form, and we knew that we wanted to

anytime, anywhere¿ so you can enjoy the benefits of unsweetened, premium matcha-made from specially-
grown Japanese green tea leaves-wherever you go.  

Crack open a can of Trader Joe's Matcha Green Tea on a warm summer evening. Or a tepid spring after-
noon. Or a frigid winter morning. It's best served chilled, but it's truly a drink for all seasons. And at 99 cents 
an 8.2-ounce can (the lowest price we've ever seen on individual cans of real Matcha Green Tea), we'd say it's

its pleasantly floral finish leaves an almost sweet, slightly toasty taste on the tongue. Stronger than most green 
tea but more mild than black tea, oolong is known for being exceptionally drinkable. Part of its drinkability 
stems from how it's processed; oolong tea is made from tea leaves that have only been partially oxidized (ex-
posed to oxygen) during processing, whereas black tea is made from leaves that have been left to fully oxidize. 
The result is so smooth that it shouldn't take you too oolong to down the whole bottle¿

We're selling each 16.9-ounce bottle of Golden Oolong Tea for $1.19, which is almost a whole dollar less than 
we've seen similar ready-to-drink oolong teas sold for elsewhere. So grab a bottle anytime your day could 
stand to be infused with brightness-you'll find it in our beverage aisle.

"Cold brew coffee connoisseurs rejoice-Trader Joe's Instant Cold Brew Coffee is back! Our supplier starts 
with 100% Arabica Coffee beans from India, and processes them using an all-natural, proprietary Cold Brew 
extraction method that took more than two years to develop. It's truly a unique approach that yields dark, 
smooth, full-bodied Cold Brew, with a caramel-like aroma and rich, cold-brew coffee taste-in an Instant! 

For a quick, captivating Cold Brew Coffee, simply add one heaping teaspoon to 12 fluid ounces of cold or hot 
water, then stir until dissolved. That's it! With the 12-to-24 hours saved by not brewing your own, you'll have 
more time to ponder all the ways you can enjoy this Cold Brew: add more or less, depending on how strong 
you prefer your Coffee; serve over ice or sip it hot; serve it black or with a splash of cream; sweeten it, if you're 
so inclined... Most instant coffee in the market is not cold brewed; if you can find it, it's typically accompanied 
by a hefty price tag and unreasonable shipping fees. Not so at your neighborhood Trader Joe's! You'll find this 
Instant-ly appealing value on our coffee shelves, every day.

"Cold brew coffee is booming. Accordingly, we've created several options, including: Black [SKU 56952] or 
Vanilla [SKU 56953] Cold Brew in cans, nitro-infused Organic Cold Brew [SKU 57583] in a glass bottle, Cold 
Brew Coffee Bags [SKU 63482] (for home brewing), and a line of Cold Brew Concentrates [SKU 50759, etc.]. 
With all these options, we still noticed a gap-and it's one that Trader Joe's Ready to Drink Cold Brew Coffee 
fills to the rim.

It comes in a large-format bottle (multiple servings), similar to our Concentrates. However, unlike the 
Concentrates, this bottle's contents require no dilution with water. More precisely, what you'll find inside is 
small-batch Cold Brew Coffee made using an authentic cold-brew process that includes 100% Arabica beans 
from Colombia that are air-roasted and ground, then steeped in cold water for at least 12 hours. What it doesn't 
include is any reconstituted coffee, additives, or preservatives.

And, just as the cold-brew-coffee connoisseur would expect, the flavor here is bold & rich, with a smooth body, 
and significantly less acid than hot-brewed java. With that acid and bitterness out of the way, you can really 
catch the hints of molasses, and notes of walnut and cocoa offered in this premium brew. Simply chill and pour 
into your glass (or pour over ice-it's best served cold) to enjoy.

We're selling 32-ounce bottles (about 3 servings) of Trader Joe's Ready to Drink Cold Brew Coffee for $4.99.

"Thanks to its versatility in food pairing, and brisk, delightful flavor whether served hot or cold, Earl Grey is one 
of the most popular tea flavors around. But given its widespread availability, how does one wade through the 
ho-hum blends out there to find a high quality cuppa that boils up with the best of them? Why, step inside your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's, of course!

Trader Joe's Organic Earl Grey Tea is a deceptively simple, organic blend of bold, full-bodied black tea from 
South India, balanced with an invigorating, floral black tea from Africa. The addition of oil from organic Italian 
Bergamot oranges lends a citrusy, heady aroma (think of Bergamot as the Meyer lemon's warm, spicy cousin) 
and brightens the flavor of its black tea counterparts-this juxtaposition creates a smooth cup that's enjoyable 
no matter the time of day. (And if the time of day happens to be teatime, may we suggest serving Organic Earl 
Grey Tea alongside Curry Chicken Salad [sku 96426] sandwiches (crusts removed, of course), Mini Orange 
Cranberry Tea Scones [sku 54051], and Lemon Bars [sku 93415]?)

For an expertly brewed cup of hot Earl Grey Tea, pour boiling water over a tea bag and brew for 3-5 minutes, 
then remove the tea bag and add sweetener, or follow British tradition and serve with a squeeze of fresh lemon. 
If you're on Team Iced Tea, the prep is similarly simple: pour four cups boiling water over 3-5 tea bags and steep 
for 3-5 minutes, then remove tea bags and pour over ice-filled glasses. At $2.49 per 1.41-ounce box of 20 bags, 
that's about 13¢ per (hot or iced) cup-an unbeatable price for a cuppa of this quality. You'll find Organic Earl 
Grey Tea near the other boxed teas at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"Coffee and electricity don't mix well, or so we've been told, so there isn't any electricity involved in these jolting 
coffee cups. (Well, except for the machine that makes the coffee.) No, this ""buzz"" we're talking about is caffeine: 
that wonderful thing that tames your otherwise monstrous morning grumpiness, or provides a much-needed 
perkiness that starts your day on the right path. And caffeine is an excellent reason to love Trader Joe's Electric 
Buzz Coffee Cups. 

Electric Buzz is no ordinary coffee cup; actually it's no ordinary coffee. A standard, eight-ounce cup of coffee 
contains 95mg of caffeine. An eight-ounce cup of Electric Buzz coffee has 170mg. The coffee beans used in 
these Cups have been carefully selected to create this higher caffeine amount. India AA Robusta, known for its 
caffeine levels, and a Brazilian Arabica coffee with nutty, chocolatey notes have been combined to create a blend 
with great flavor and a jolt of caffeine. 

Electric Buzz is conveniently portioned into twelve single-serve cups for use with your Keurig K-Cup® coffee 
maker. Each individual cup package is nitrogen flushed and sealed for freshness. One ""cup"" yields one serving 
of hot coffee. It's easy. It's fast. It's packed with caffeine. It also happens to be delicious.

Each 5.08-ounce box of 12 Trader Joe's Electric Buzz Coffee Cups is $5.49-a shocking value that's, not so 
shockingly, only found only at Trader Joe's.

"Our Cold Brew Coffee Concentrates have been all the rage for quite a while now, dominating the coffee section 
with their smooth, easy-drinking goodness. But why should coffee have all the fun? Tea is terrific, too! For 
months, we concentrated on the task at hand... and came up with a Concentrate to beat the band! 

Trader Joe's Organic Cold Brew Black Tea Concentrate is made with nothing but fine-quality black tea, 
filtered water, and a bit of citric acid for freshness. Even after you reconstitute the unsweetened Concentrate 
with cold water, its flavor holds its own. Or, if iced beverages aren't your thing, add hot water instead-you'll 
still enjoy the smooth-drinking, nuanced flavor that can only come from Cold Brew! Add one part Organic 
Cold Brew Black Tea Concentrate to seven parts water, and you've got yourself a crispy, refreshing glass (or 
cup) of tea.

Each 16-fluid-ounce bottle of Concentrate makes up to one gallon, or 16 cups, of tea. At our price of $4.99* 
per bottle, that comes out to about 31¢ per cup! Imagine that-a cold brew tea without the typical cold brew 
price tag, available every day, only at your neighborhood Trader Joe's...
