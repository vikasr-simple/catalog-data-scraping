"Our TJ Grand Reserve label is ""reserved"" for special wines we feel are unique values and truly represent 
the qualities of their appellation. This Carneros Chardonnay comes from a terrific winery in Sonoma 
County and they specialize in Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This is our second vintage and we think it 
easily matches the quality of the 2015 vintage. This wine more than meets our expectation of a great 
Carneros Chardonnay.  It is an unbeatable deal!!  The Lot# 20 is the same lot number that we used for 
the 2015, thereby letting our customers and crew know that the source and winemaking team are exactly 
the same; only the vintage has changed. 

 
Oak Barrel Fermentation: 
Inspired by its pioneering roots in 1969, this little-known corner straddling Sonoma and Napa's southern 
boundaries is known as Carneros. The grapes included in this Carneros Chardonnay were hand harvested 
from four different vineyards in the Carneros region including Sangacimo Vineyard, Herman Vineyards, 
Wildcat Mountain, and Thornton Vineyard. The wine was aged in French and Hungarian oak barrels 
(25% new French oak) for 12 months before bottled unfiltered.  A beautiful honey color in the glass, this 
Carneros Chardonnay offers delicate aromas of Fuji apple, marzipan, and peach blossom. Layered flavors 
of Asian pear, lemon curd, and baked peaches are complimented by notes of vanilla oak and soft spice. 
Medium bodied, this wine coats the palate but is balanced with bright acidity on the finish.",51341,,750 mL,,Grand Reserve Chardonnay Carneros 2023,12.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/grand-reserve-chardonnay-carneros-2023-051341,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Grand Reserve Chardonnay Carneros 2023"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Grand Reserve Chardonnay Carneros 2023\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":12.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Effortless Entertaining"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"When covering all your bases for a dinner party, holiday feast, or really any kind of get-together where great 
food is involved, don't forget to pick up something special and spirited as an after-dinner treat-something like 
Trader Joe's Espresso Martini. Modeled after the cocktail craze that's been sweeping bar menus these past few 
years, this pre-mixed and totally ready-to-drink Espresso Martini is made with a base of vodka, espresso, and 
a touch of vanilla so that every sip is rich, sweet, and strikingly smooth-ideal for serving alongside something 
chocolatey and decadent. 

Of course, that's just one of many situations in which a pre-made Martini might make the evening that much 
more elegant. It's excellent for keeping in the fridge as an instant way to elevate a Friday evening. It makes an 
alluring accompaniment to cheese boards and hors d'oeuvres platters. And, since each bottle contains roughly 
four servings, it's a bit like an instant-cocktail-party-in-a-bottle for you and three friends, and all for a price 
that's less than what you'd pay for a single espresso martini at most cocktail bars! Now, isn't that sweet? That's 
that Trader Joe's Espresso Martini!

"If you want fruit-forward, ripe and powerful red wine, look no further than Puglia which is where this 
Susumaniello originated. It's jam-packed with fruity goodness and is a wonderful showcase of the 
quality wine coming out of the region. The price we're able to offer is certainly a value and as this is an 
everyday wine, customers are safe to put it on their shopping list every week! The grape name 
""Susumaniello"" is derived from somarello, meaning ""donkey"", presumably because just like the donkeys 
once used for transporting the grape harvest - this high-yielding variety is capable of bearing 
remarkably heavy loads. 

Puglian wine is the product of a diverse landscape. The warm climate and fertile soil make it easy to 
grow almost anything. Puglia is surrounded by water on three sides allowing cool breezes off the 
Mediterranean to moderate vineyard temperatures. The grapes for this Susumaniello were hand- 
harvested and processed with a low-frequency stemmer, maceration and fermentation. The wine is then 
matured in steel, as well as wood barrels.

"The Langhe hills of northwest Italy's Piedmont region are home to some of the most prestigious and 

long-lived wines produced from the noble Nebbiolo grape. This particular bottling hails from the Langhe 

DOC, a broad regional designation that includes the area south of Alba and encompasses the most prestigious 

appellations of Piedmont (Barolo, Barbaresco), where the grape is regaled for its ability to translate the area's 

unique terroir into profoundly aromatic and structured wines.  

Swirling allows the captivating perfume to unfurl - revealing beguiling aromas of ripe cherry, dried 

roses, fresh tar, licorice, truffles and autumnal woodland notes. On the palate, the texture is simultaneously 

broad and chiseled with sturdy but fine-grained tannins carrying impressions of rich red and dark fruits, spice 

and lingering minerality across a juicy, mouth-watering finish that goes on and on. While still somewhat 

youthful after a few years, this Nebbiolo Langhe DOC is enjoyable now and will also reward those with the 

patience to cellar it for a few years further.   

The wine's boldly structured and savory character calls for heartier fare to allow its complexity to 

fully shine. Perfectly matched with rich dishes featuring wild game, cured meats or aged cheeses, this 

Nebbiolo would be sublime paired with venison stew with juniper berries, wild boar ragu tossed with 

pappardelle, or a board of Toma Piemontese and Bra Duro with shaved truffles. For vegetarians, roasted 

portobello mushrooms with rosemary or baked pasta al forno with caramelized onions would stand up nicely.

"Our partnership with the Miller family, premium growers in the Central Coast, has given us first choice

The Santa Maria Valley AVA is in the northern part of the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties

"What more can you ask for in a Pinot Noir from France than elegance and beauty?  The Loudenotte

"We're over the moon to bring to you yet another entry in 
Trader Moon's ""Moon X"" wines, after the Moon X Dark Red 
Blend (SKU 54813) proved to be a smash hit with our 
customers. The winemaking team behind our Trader Moon 
series are experts at the dark, fruity profile that's been seriously 
in vogue lately, and we developed with them a twist on the 
dark fruit formula: Black Pinot Noir. All the soft elegance of 
Pinot with the lush, juicy structure of a ""dark"" red wine - this 
is the next big thing, trust us! 
 
Of course, in addition to boasting an awesome profile, the 
Moon X Black Pinot also goes for an awesome price. Because 
we work directly with the winery (and don't sink a lot of costs 
into market research and stuff like that for the brand) we're 
able to offer the Moon X at a fraction of the price that you'd 
pay for similar wines out there at other retailers. Make sure to 
point this one out to your regular ""dark"" red customers - at 
Trader Joe's, they'll be able to grab the next big thing for quite 
a small price!

"Every now and then, we introduce a product that, from the moment it's released, reaches a kind of instantaneously 
iconic status. Our Speculoos Cookie Butter [sku 96761] certainly fits that bill. The moment this superlatively 
soft, sweet spread hit our grocery shelves, our customers couldn't get enough. We heard tell of folks mixing 
it into brownie batter, blending it in coffee drinks, drizzling it over a sundae¿ This got us thinking: if cookie 
butter goes well with all those desserts, we bet it would taste great as a dessert beer, too. Lo and behold, that bet 
has paid off, in the form of our Speculoos Cookie Butter Beer.

It's made in collaboration with one of our favorite craft breweries  (and an award-winning producer of delicious 
dessert beers), Hardywood Park. For this impressive imperial golden ale, they use vanilla beans, milk sugar, and 
toasted coconut to evoke the sweet, caramel-y flavor of Cookie Butter in every rich, flavorful sip. It's excellent 
as both an after-dinner indulgence, and when enjoyed on a long, lazy, late-summer weekend afternoon; we're 
partial to pairing our Cookie Butter Beer with cheesecake, toasted Vegan Banan Bread with Walnuts [sku

"Nestled in the hills in one of the fastest growing wine regions in California, next to Clear Lake and at the 

base of Mount Konocti volcano lays this spectacular growing region, Lake County. Here the grapes grow in 

volcanic, mineral- rich soils at high altitudes where mild summers and cool winters create ideal conditions 

for producing elegant and complex wines. Our trusted winery partners sent us this gem of buy and treasure to 

taste. This Lake County Cabernet exhibits all the reasons we love California Cabs. With aromas of bright 

black fruits, hints of licorice and a velvety finish that dances across your palate, who would not want to bring 

this to your next gathering! And with a price tag of $4.99, you would be crazy not to get your hands on this! 

 

Wine makers across the state concluded that 2020, though marked with challenges, actually produced smaller 

yet exceptional quality harvest. A dry winter followed by a warmer than average summer, meant the grapes 

were petite but more concentrated in flavor, which will produce richer and more depth of character in this 

delicious wine.",76075,,750 mL,,Motif Cabernet Sauvignon Red Hills Lake County,4.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/motif-cabernet-sauvignon-red-hills-lake-county-076075,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Motif Cabernet Sauvignon Red Hills Lake County"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Motif Cabernet Sauvignon Red Hills Lake County\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/76075.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":4.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Pair With Wine"",""Picnic""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"Ah, Syrah. This fabulously full-bodied, dependably delicious grape forms the backbone of many a rich red 
wine, due in large part to its remarkable adaptability: Syrahs from warmer environs tend to be bigger and 
bolder, while those grown in more moderate conditions are almost always softer and gentler. Carefully crafted 
with grapes in California's Sonoma County, Trader Joe's Grand Reserve Syrah Lot 133 is a bit of both, thanks 
to Sonoma's bright, sunny days and long, cool nights. With its medium-to-full body, fine tannins, and juicy, 
peppery profile, it might just be the ideal red wine for the end of summer.

Lush, fruity, and complex, with decidedly smooth edges, this Grand Reserve Syrah makes an especially apt 
accompaniment to a smoky, barbecued brisket, grilled veggies, or a juicy Angus Chuck, Brisket & Sirloin Burger 
[sku 79580] with all your favorite fixings. As you sip it, be sure to let all its flavors sink in: our tasting panel 
found notes of candied blueberries, white pepper, and even a bit of beef jerky. Of course, no matter what you 
find on your palate, you'll be sure to find our Grand Reserve Sonoma County Syrah a tremendous value-
whie supplies last, of course.

"Crafted for us with care by an expert winemaker within Napa Valley's Yountville A.V.A. (American Viticultural 
Area), our latest Trader Joe's Reserve Chardonnay is the very definition of a fine wine. After the grapes are 
picked, crushed, and macerated, the juice is aged in both new oak and once-used French oak barrels for eight 
months. In your glass, this Chardonnay opens with enticing aromas of ripe pear and honeydew, leading to a 
palate that unveils an ideal balance between crisp green apple and hints of toasted vanilla. Refreshing acidity 
and subtle oak nuances culminate in a creamy, lingering finish that is ultimately a delightful expression of 
Yountville's esteemed terroir.

Creamy chicken dishes are a classic pairing with Chardonnay, and our Organic Boneless Skinless Chicken 
Breasts [sku 63550] lend themselves beautifully to Poulet à la Crème or Chicken Fricassée-if you're in the 
cheffing mood. Go lighter (both calorie & work-wise) with either a ready-to-eat Caesar Salad with Salmon 
[sku 78792] or Chicken [sku 06832], from our refrigerators. And if the weather's fine, and you're up for a more 
casual experience, Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar Chicken Sausages [sku 74048] are fantastic on the grill, and 
a nice complement to this Napa white.

"We love a Spritz and when we found the opportunity to add this convenient 3pk of 200ml bottles, it was too 
good to pass up. As a wine-based cocktail with natural flavors added to replicate the traditional liqueur (most 
common being Aperol), we're also able to offer this in all stores that sell wine, so the more the merrier!  
 
While some people may consider the spritz a summer drink, traditionally they're enjoyed throughout the year 
and we see this as a great ready-to-drink option to keep on hand. Crafted with a blend of fine ingredients, 
Aperito Spritz offers a tantalizing fusion of flavors that effortlessly captivate the senses. Designed to be the 
perfect companion for relaxing after a long day or enhancing vibrant gatherings, this delightful drink 
embodies sophistication and indulgence. Aperito is a light and refreshing drink with a mingling of wonderful 
aromatics and flavors of bittersweet orange and herbal notes. This Spritz is ready to serve, upon chilling, and 
can be enjoyed straight away. For the perfect experience, we recommend enjoying this chilled on the rocks 
and garnished with a slice of orange. As noted above, don't forget to stop by the cheese & salami section

"If you're in the mood for a refreshing, aromatic Aperitivo, then you're in luck, because Trader Joe's can get 
you one-Pronto! If you're in need of a mixer for making complex, flavorful cocktails, the Trader Joe's spirits

over social media, and need an Italian herbal liqueur to base it around, Trader Joe's can hook you up-Pronto! 
Trader Joe's Pronto! Amaro Aperitivo, to be specific! It's made especially for us by a distiller in Italy, who 
infuses each batch with alluringly aromatic herbs and zesty orange peel to create a flavor profile that's bracingly 
bitter, yet eminently easy-drinking.

As a pre-meal Apertivo, Pronto! can be enjoyed entirely on its own, served neat or on the rocks, though we find 
that a squeeze of lemon or orange helps bring the best out of its herbaceous attributes. As a cocktail ingredient, 
it's an essential element of a Negroni, Paper Plane, or Black Manhattan, and makes a superb substitute for 
vermouth for those looking to try a new take on their old favorites. And, of course, if you've got your sights on 
a classic Amaro spritz, you can't go wrong mixing three parts sparkling wine (our Cecilia Beretta Prosecco [sku 
98097] is always a sure bet), two parts Pronto!, and one part soda water.

"The Loire Valley, south of Paris and about in the middle of France, is known widely for its wine production-
most notably, white wines. Sauvignon Blanc from the sub-region of Sancerre is perhaps this Valley's most 
famous white. But while Sancerre may be the most well-known and prestigious white-wine provenance in the 
region, there's another sub-region called Touraine that produces comparable whites. And Touraine is where 
Vignobles Lacheteau Sauvignon Blanc originates.

Vignobles Lacheteau Touraine Sauvignon Blanc is, indeed, composed of 100% Sauvignon Blanc grapes, and 
is fermented in stainless steel tanks to preserve its fresh flavor profile and vibrant character. It's deeply aromatic, 
with bright notes of citrus and spring blossoms, tasters will note a pronounced, yet balanced, acidity that 
keeps the palate engaged with every scintillating sip. Drink it chilled, on its own, or enjoy a glass with a green 
salad with Goat Cheese [sku 19751] and French Vinaigrette with Shallots [sku 77302]. You may find it pairs 
surprisingly well with a grilled Sweet Italian Sausage [sku 66728], too.

"If you frequent the wine section at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, you've likely come across Maison Barboulot 
Cabernet Syrah [sku 62771]. (And if you haven't visited the wine section lately, come say hi! Our Crew are 
friendly, knowledgeable, and would love to tell you about their favorites). This one-time hidden gem is now 
a solid customer favorite, thanks to its amazing quality and equally excellent price. So, when our buyer came 
across a rosé from the same region in France, with the same quality-to-price characteristics, we jumped at the 
chance to bring it into stores. Just in time for summer, give it up for Maison Barboulot Cinsault Rosé!

If you were sitting at a sidewalk café in France, this is likely what you'd find in your glass come happy hour. 
It's made from 100% Cinsault (pronounced ""SAN-soh"") grapes, grown among the morning mists and 
Mediterranean sea breezes of the Pays d'Oc region. Those growing conditions contribute to the wine's artful 
balance of floral and fruity notes and its dry and refreshing nature, as well as its light and lively palate that plays 
well with baked salmon, pesto chicken, or a citrus-y pasta salad. We're delighted to say: Rosé is here to stay!

"While making cocktails at home is certainly fun, nothing quite beats having a skilled bartender make one 
for you. Which presents us with the exact kind of problem we love to solve: how can you enjoy an expertly 
crafted mixed drink at home, without being an expert mixologist yourself? How can you have your margarita, 
and drink it too-so to speak? Wouldn't you know it, we have just thing: Trader Joe's Everything But the 
Bartender Classic Lime Margarita.

Made with real tequila, agave syrup, and lime juice, this pre-mixed, totally ready-to-drink Lime Margarita has 
all the sweetness, citrus, and spirit you'd expect from a margarita at a treasured, local cantina. It really does 
have everything-except the bartender, of course. Excellent when served chilled, right out of the can, or in a 
salt-rimmed glass with ice, each 200mL can is perfectly portioned for a single serving, making every four-pack 
a party-in-waiting for you and three friends. And since each four-pack sells for a price that beats many a happy 
hour special for a single cocktail, this might just be the most affordable Margarita you'll ever encounter.

"Nestled amidst the magnificent landscape of Washington's Columbia Valley AVA, the Wahluke [wah-LUKE] 
Slope is well known for its magnificent red grape varietals. Its dry days, cool nights, and rocky soils offer 
ideal conditions for cultivating world-class grapes-and with the right precision and care, world-class grapes 
become world-class wines. We are thrilled to introduce Trader Joe's Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon Lot #253 
from Wahluke Slope, a bold, yet deftly balanced Cab that epitomizes the essence of this extraordinary terroir.

Made with 100% organic Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, each sip boasts a bouquet of red plum, dark cocoa, and 
rich earth. It's initially smooth on the palate, with notes of ripe fruit and minerality that are ably accented with 
delicately spiced oak. The long finish is lifted by natural acidity and integrated tannins, making this wine an 
ideal complement to the savoriness and spice of our Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667], a great companion 
to a grilled steak, and a perfect pairing for our Double Cream Brie [sku 74953].

"Of all the styles of sparkling wine the world has to offer, you'd be hard pressed to find a more versatile variety 
than Prosecco. Light, floral, and fruity, it serves equally well before, during, and after a meal, enjoyed just as it 
is, or mixed into a mimosa or other fizzy cocktail. And that's precisely why we're partnering with a prominent 
Prosecco provider to present, for the first time, our very own Trader Joe's Prosecco.

Made within the DOC (which is to say, controlled designation of origin) confines of northeastern Italy, this is a 
truly proper Prosecco. Each brisk, bubbly sip starts with a bouquet of wisteria flower and freshly sliced apples, 
which leads gracefully into well-balanced notes of stone fruit and toasted almond. It's a superb sparkler to keep 
on hand for everything from birthday brunches, to romantic dinner dates, to spontaneous celebrations. And 
with the value we're offering for each bottle, there's plenty of reason to spontaneously celebrate!

"In the land ripe with passion from everything from dance to soccer, it is no wonder that this 

exquisite Malbec from the renowned Uco Valley exudes passion with every sip. Crafted with upmost 
care and attention to detail, this wine embodies the essence of the valley's unique terroir, know for its 
high altitude and perfect climate. All grapes were hand harvested from the estate vineyard, fermented in 
small concrete tanks and then aged in French oak barrels. The result is a wine of exceptional quality and 
character, capturing the spirit of the passion that is instilled in all things Argentinian.  

With its deep crimson hues that evoke the grace and sensuality of passion, this wine enchants 
the senses from the moment it touches your glass. The bouquet reveals a symphony of aromas where 
bold red fruits like cherry and plum embrace notes of leather, spice and dark chocolate on the palate, it 
is rich, full bodied with a velvety smooth finish. Notes of ripe blackberries, black cherry an a touch of 
vanilla dance across your palate. The well intergraded tannins add structure and elegance while a hint 
smoky oak lingers on the finish, leaving a lasting impression.

"Trader Joe's Wine is¿ 

The Bailly-Lapierre Winery is located in the North of Burgundy, in an ancestral wellspring. Since its very 

beginning in 1972, it has been the ancient underground quarries, with subterranean galleries extending of 

over 10 acres. They provide unique natural conditions that are ideal for the production of Crémant: a 

naturally cool temperature at a constant 52 F, ideal maturing and ageing, a naturally high level of moisture 

(about 80% humidity in the heart of the winery), soft diffused light that helps preserve the flavor and the 

color of fine wines. 

La Burgondie Crémant de Bourgogne is made using exactly the same methods employed in the making of 

Champagne - the Méthode Traditionelle. It is a blend of premium Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Gamay and 

Aligotè grapes, and exhibits solid structure, mildly fruity flavor and fine bubbles. Because Burgundy's 

sparkling wines are not as well-known as those from Champagne, they tend to cost considerably less. But 

don't be deceived by the price. Crémant de Bourgogne is every bit as good - or better - than wines carrying

"Ever since we started carrying wines-lo, those many decades ago-we've made it our mission to ensure that 
every time you make the trek to your neighborhood Trader Joe's wine shop, you'll find something wonderful. 
Whether it's an everyday gem or one of our limited-quantity Trader Joe's Reserve wines, there's always 
something reliably fantastic to try-and for an unimpeachably excellent value, too. Now, we're continuing that 
mission with the introduction of Trading Post by Trader Joe's. Made exclusively for us by a trusted winery 
partner in the heart of Napa Valley, you can think of the Trading Post label as the best of both worlds among 
our wine selection, combining the same outstanding quality and value of our limited-run Reserve wines with 
the consistent availability of our everyday favorites.

For the Trading Post's inaugural outing, we're offering a characteristically robust and elegant Napa Valley 
Cabernet Sauvignon. With rich and alluring aromatics of black cherry, vanilla, and tobacco, and a complex 
profile of ripe fruit, baking spice, and toasty oak, it's precisely the kind of jammy Cab that made Napa famous. 
Bold, yet easy-drinking, with a long, languid, satisfying finish, it serves just as well paired with a seared steak or 
hearty stew as it does completely on its own, enjoyed with a book, movie, or good company.

"Beer is usually thought of as a ""drink now"" kind of beverage, as in: ""Hey, when you're at Trader Joe's, pick us up 
a six-pack to drink while we watch the game this afternoon!"" What if we offered a beer and suggested you wait a 
year before cracking it open? Trader Joe's Vintage Ale is that beer. Brewed and bottled in limited quantities just 
for us during the holidays, it becomes more complex and interesting as time goes by-making this ""drink later"" 
proposition an interesting one, indeed.

Our strong, dark, Belgian-style ale has an additional bit of fresh yeast added to it just before bottling. This causes 
a second fermentation in the bottle, leaving behind ""lees"" (sediment) that add much to the flavor and mouthfeel 
of this Ale. And since it is not pasteurized, the original aromas and flavors (cocoa and malt, with notes of citrus, 
ginger, and baking spices) evolve through aging to gain even more complexity. (Tip: ideal storage conditions for 
graceful aging call for standing the bottle upright, in a cool, dark environment.)

Vintage Ale is equally at home when paired with roasted holiday meats and mashed potatoes, or a slice of Sweet 
Potato Pie with Maple Bourbon Flavor [sku 57666]. Choose to drink it now and you'll definitely be pleased. Or, 
you can let it mature while you enjoy last year's 2015 Vintage Ale. What's that? You say you didn't buy one last 
year? We can't let that happen again (see reference to ""limited quantities"" above). Our 2016 Vintage Ale in a 750 
ml. bottle sells for the ""buy now"" price of $5.99 (plus deposit where applicable).",84791,,750 mL,,Vintage Spiced Ale 2023,5.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/vintage-spiced-ale-2023-084791,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Vintage Spiced Ale 2023"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Vintage Spiced Ale 2023\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/beer/84791.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":5.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Bibulous"",""Crack a Beer"",""Effortless Entertaining"",""Game Night"",""Glass Half Full"",""Merry-making""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"A couple of holiday seasons ago, we introduced an Egg Nog Liqueur [sku 60533], and folks liked it even more 
than we expected. So last year, we ordered more, so we wouldn't run out quite so quickly. This year, we've 
decided to go a step further, and in addition to that proven punch-replacement, we're introducing Trader 
Joe's Cocoa Cream Liqueur. Conceptually similar to its Egg Nog kin, this one is ostensibly a cup of cocoa, 
pre-spiked with alcohol, in a convenient 750mL bottle. You can serve it over ice, pour it over vanilla ice cream, 
add it to an after-dinner coffee, gild it with Peppermint Mini Marshmallows [sku 66459], or just sip it, straight.

We have limited quantities of Cocoa Cream Liqueur for the holiday season, so stock up while you can. We're 
selling each 750mL bottle for $7.99, while it lasts.

"We first dipped our toes into what turned out to be an ever-flowing river of holiday-inspired Cream Liqueurs 
way back in 2017¿ and things just took off from there. That first year, it was our now-famous TJ's Egg Nog 
Liqueur that made a splash. Next, in 2018, we added TJ's Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur to the lineup. Then, in 
2019, TJ's Cocoa Cream Liqueur saw its grand debut, followed in 2020 by the advent of TJ's Gingerbread Cream 
Liqueur. This year, we're expanding the selection even further, inspired by Trader Joe's own TJ's Candy Cane 
Joe-Joe's Chocolate Crème Sandwich Cookies: Trader Joe's Peppermint Joe-Joe's Cream Liqueur.
 
Our Peppermint Joe-Joe's Cream Liqueur begins with a neutral grain spirit, to which we add cream, sugar, 
peppermint extract, and a hint of natural cocoa flavor to mimic the mint-cookies-'n-cream flavor of the cookies 
from which this Liqueur takes its name. Like its forebears, it's delicious on its own, warmed or over ice. It also 
makes a mighty tasty, spiked peppermint latte-just add it to hot or iced coffee, sit back, and sip away the cares 
of the day. We've also heard rumors that this one really shines when poured over vanilla ice cream-or blended 
with vanilla ice cream for a dreamy ""adult"" milkshake. (Add some crushed TJ's Candy Cane Joe-Joe's to that 
shake if you really want to be WOW-ed¿) You'll find it in 750mL bottles at Trader Joe's stores where spirits are 
sold, while we can keep them in stock. Run, run, Rudolph-over to your neighborhood store¿

"A winter tradition dating back to 15th century Germany, Glühwein (pronounced GLOO-vine) is a style of 
sweet, mulled wine that has been keeping spirits bright for more than 600 years. Our supplier in Germany 
makes a particularly tasty rendition from a recipe of 100% Sangiovese, which they spice with cinnamon, vanilla, 
cloves, nutmeg, and the zest of orange and lemon. Here in the States, they call it Hark and Holly Glühwein. 
And at Trader Joe's, we call it one of our favorite ways to keep warm during the holidays.

Simply heat a few mugs' worth of Hark and Holly on the stovetop, then serve to your guests as an aperitif 
with appetizers (we find its rich, fruity spice is especially suited to cheese and crackers) or as a nightcap at the 
end of your wintry revels. Just be sure to pick your bottle up soon-we only carry Hark and Holly during the 
holidays. While supplies last, you'll find 1L bottles of this good-natured Glühwein in our wine section.

"One of the first areas in Chile to plant wine-growing grapes, the Maule Valley has since become the country's 
premier viticultural region for creating big, bold, and highly complex reds. Situated near the center of Chile's 
narrow span, just a little south of Santiago, the Valley is blessed with a relatively cool climate and remarkably 
fertile soils, both a product of the mighty Maule River's presence. Conditions like these help grapes develop 
juicy flavor profiles, strong, supportive tannins, and well-balanced levels of acidity-all of which are expressed 
most elegantly in Trader Joe's Gran Reserva Maule Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Lot 121.

Each sip of this Gran Reserva Cab is rich, robust, and oaky (a result of being aged in French and American 
oak for a year and a half), with lightly peppery edges that tickle the corners of one's palate. It's a fascinating, 
well-concentrated profile that synergizes spectacularly well with the flavors of grilled meat, pan-fried sausage, 
or a roast Bacon Wrapped Porchetta [sku 55559]. And, of course, since we sell it in our label, it's also an extreme 
value. ¡Salud!

"People drink Pinot Noir year-round, but Thanksgiving is this variety's time to shine. That's because, generally-
speaking, the multi-faceted flavor profile of Pinot Noir pairs well with traditional Thanksgiving fare. Our 
latest Grand Reserve Pinot Noir from Santa Lucia Highlands further promotes this Thanksgiving-Pinot 
Noir partnership.

This 2021 vintage was cultivated during a cooler growing season. The mild temperatures, overnight fog, and 
afternoon winds in Monterey County (where Santa Lucia Highlands AVA is located), brought forth fuller 
grape development, and preserved acid levels in the fruit. This yielded intense, multi-dimensional fruit flavors 
and textures in the wine. You'll experience notes of blueberry/boysenberry, nutmeg, rich cocoa, vanilla, and 
brown sugar on the nose. On the sip, flavors of sage, raspberry, rhubarb, and cherry emerge. Now think about 
your holiday menu: do you recognize any points of connection? Pick up a couple bottles of TJ's Grand 
Reserve Pinot Noir SLH; one to enjoy with your big holiday meal, and another to sip with the leftovers!

"This time of year, we eat pumpkin, and not just in actual gourd form. Visit your neighborhood Trader Joe's and 
you'll discover dozens of pumpkin products to taste, such as Pumpkin Ginger Scones [sku 76650], Pumpkin O's 
[sku 53711], Pumpkin Spice Peanut Butter Cups [sku 76745]... But what if you like to drink your pumpkin? At 
Trader Joe's, you can do that, too! The Gourd Tree Pumpkin Cider is one of several drinkable options. Here's 
the story...

After being disappointed by other pumpkin ciders on the market-with their predominant apple flavor and 
spices verging on potpourri-we approached one of the breweries with whom we've partnered quite a bit 
to help us develop a superior version. Initial results were disappointing... until we added actual pumpkin 
and squash purée! The Gourd Tree Pumpkin Cider is 22% pumpkin & squash purée, added to the base 
of fermented, not-from-concentrate apple juice from Oregon. (While we're on percentages, this Cider is 5% 
ABV-conveniently session-able for this season of get-togethers.) 

The apple-cider excellence and authentic pumpkin flavor are brought together with hints of fall spices, and 
just the right amount of carbonation to make this light-bodied beverage crisp and refreshing. And now, we're 
selling Gourd Tree in six-packs of 12 fluid-ounce cans (instead of bottles), but only while our fall supplies last!

"Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is a rich, complexly malted lager, made exclusively for us by a respected West 
Coast craft brewer who marries modern-day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, that 
""marriage"" takes some inspiration from a real-life historical wedding! First celebrated in Munich in 1810, the 
inaugural Oktoberfest was thrown to mark the nuptials of Kronprinz Ludwig to Princess Therese of Saxe-
Hildburghausen. Now nearly synomous with beer, Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is an homage to the festival's 
official drink, known to locals as Märzenbier. In fact, in order to match Märzenbier's marvelously malty profile, 
the brewers at Josephsbrau have imported three kinds of malts all the way from Germany!

Each sip of Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is full-bodied and caramel-y, but with a light enough touch of hops that it 
remains remarkably easy-drinking. We recommend serving it well chilled, out of the can or in a frosty glass (or 
stein, if you've got one!), preferably alongside a grilled steak, sausage, or burger. We find that its toasty caramel 
malts are particularly suited to pairing with seared, and even slightly charred proteins-try a can the next time 
you've got chicken wings, ribs, or brats on the barbecue.

"The 2023 Charles Shaw Chardonnay offers a bright and approachable expression of 

this classic varietal. In the glass, it presents a pale straw color with glints of green. The nose 
reveals aromas of ripe golden apple, Meyer lemon, and a hint of tropical pineapple, 
underscored by subtle notes of vanilla and toasted oak. 

This Chardonnay hails from select vineyards across California's diverse wine regions. 
The Mediterranean climate, with its warm days and cool nights, allows for optimal ripening 
while maintaining fresh acidity. Predominantly sourced from the Central Valley, the wine also 
includes fruit from coastal areas, contributing complexity and balance to the final blend. 
On the palate, the wine is medium-bodied with flavors that mirror the nose, complemented by 
touches of pear and white peach. Its moderate acidity and gentle oak influence make it a 
versatile companion to a range of dishes.  

Pair this Chardonnay with grilled chicken, creamy pasta dishes, or mild cheeses. It also 
serves well as an aperitif or alongside light seafood preparations such as grilled shrimp or 
baked cod.",52435,,750 mL,,Charles Shaw Chardonnay,3.49,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/charles-shaw-chardonnay-052435,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Charles Shaw Chardonnay"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Charles Shaw Chardonnay\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/52435.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":3.49,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"Big Churn Chardonnay offers a delightful expression of California's sun-kissed vineyards. This golden-hued wine 
greets the nose with aromas of ripe pear, crisp green apple, and subtle hints of vanilla. On the palate, it unfolds 
with layers of tropical fruit flavors, including pineapple and mango, balanced by a refreshing citrus acidity. The 
finish is long and creamy, with nuances of toasted oak and butter, characteristic of a well-crafted California 
Chardonnay. 
The grapes for Big Churn Chardonnay are sourced from select vineyards in California's Central Coast, where 
cool maritime breezes and foggy mornings create an ideal microclimate for Chardonnay cultivation. The region's 
diverse soils, ranging from sandy loam to limestone-rich terrains, impart a distinct minerality to the wine. This 
terroir influence, combined with careful viticulture and winemaking practices, results in a Chardonnay that 
beautifully captures the essence of its California origins. 
This versatile white wine pairs exceptionally well with a variety of cuisines. Its rich texture and balanced acidity 
make it an excellent companion to creamy pasta dishes, grilled seafood, and roasted poultry. For a classic pairing, 
serve it alongside butter-poached lobster or a creamy mushroom risotto. The wine's fruit-forward profile also 
complements lighter fare such as Caesar salad or fresh goat cheese. For a delightful appetizer pairing, try it with 
crab cakes or a selection of mild, soft cheeses.",56083,,750 mL,,Big Churn Chardonnay California,6.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/big-churn-chardonnay-california-056083,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Big Churn Chardonnay California"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":6.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full"",""Picnic""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"Not all of us are naturally-born mixologists. Nor do all of us have the time to break out the shaker when we're 
in the mood for a cocktail. Sometimes, when we're ready to drink, it's just great to have a ready-to-drink 
cocktail on hand. That's why we're introducing Trader Joe's Old Fashioned, a pre-mixed, precisely formulated, 
classic cocktail that's ready-to-drink, right out of the bottle. Now, whenever you need an old fashioned Old 
Fashioned, it's simply a matter of grabbing a glass-no measuring, shaking, or stirring required.

Trader Joe's Old Fashioned is made for us by a small, craft distiller, using the time-tested recipe of Bourbon 
whiskey, cane sugar, and a custom blend of spiced orange bitters. Every sip is deliciously balanced between the 
sweetness of muddled sugar and caramel notes of Bourbon, and the citric zest of orange and bite of aromatic 
bitters. We like it best served simply over ice, though it certainly takes stunningly well to being mixed with 
an equal part of sparkling water and garnished with an Amarena Cherry [sku 60745]. While we can keep it 
in stock, you can find 750 mL bottles of Trader Joe's Old Fashioned for $16.99* (or per market), during the 
holiday season. Look for it in our spirits section.

"Josephsbrau Summer Brew is brewed for us by a respected West Coast craft brewer who marries modern-
day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, they're using top-fermenting ale yeast that is 
fermented at colder, lager-style temperatures. This creates an ale-lager hybrid in the Kölsch style. Ingredients 
include German ale yeast, quality two-row malted barley, and Hallertauer & Tetnang hops. With a golden straw 
hue and a creamy head, this beer presents a light-hop profile that's delicious and refreshing.

Summer Brew is ready to pair with all the foods that go along with the warmer months. Enjoy while grilling 
burgers and Uncured Bavarian Brats [sku 57632]. Or savor some poured in a chilled glass and paired with a 
crisp, Lemony Arugula Basil Salad [sku 66293] and sautéed Argentinian Red Shrimp [sku 70359]. 

Formerly available in glass bottles, Josephsbrau Summer Brew is now available in six-packs of 12-ounce 
cans. Cans not only protect beer from damaging light exposure, but they are also more often and more easily 
recycled than glass bottles. They're also faster to chill, and virtually unbreakable. So, grab some Summer Brew 
cans at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, pop the top, and drink up!

"With its superlatively smooth mouth feel and rich notes of brown sugar and baking spice, Trader Joe's Panama 
Rum might just be the finest rum we've ever carried. Not just the finest rum from Panama, not just the finest 
barrel-aged rum, not even just the finest rum we've ever sold for under twenty dollars  -the finest rum, period. 
What's the secret behind such smooth, sippable success? Each batch spends at least five whole years aging in 
100% Bourbon barrels, before being finished in wine barrels, which not only mellows out its edges, but imparts 
some delicately spiced aromatics to accentuate its naturally caramel-y profile.

So, how best to enjoy such an eminently easy-drinking spirit? We find that it makes an excellent sipping rum, 
simply served neat or on the rocks. That said, we certainly wouldn't discourage mixing it with a bit of club 
soda, pineapple juice, or Organic Coconut Water [sku 65256], or even using it as the star of a minty mojito or 
refreshing Hemingway daiquiri. As far as food goes, we'd reccomend pairing it with spicy, full-flavored fare, 
like a seared steak with Chimmichurri [sku 73649] or a peppery pulled pork sandwich.

"Meritage wines must contain at least two of five ""noble"" grape varieties, which include: Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot. Perhaps now you recognize the heritage of this meritorious 
wine's portmanteau? And speaking of meritorious wines, here's one for you: Trader Joe's Reserve Paso Robles 
Meritage. This is a sturdy and balanced Meritage, with many glorious layers to discover. Cabernet Sauvignon, 
Petit Verdot, Merlot, and Malbec are blended to produce a medium-bodied wine with deep, ruby-red color. 
Fruity aromas on the nose lead to complex flavors on the palate, including dark berries and moderate oak 
notes. 

The discerning taster may even detect notes of chocolate chips on the medium-length finish. A tray of sliced 
Blueberry Fields Cheese [sku 76320] and crackers would easily merit a spot next to this wine. And this kind of

"Everywhere the eye can see vineyards and lush rolling hills creating the most beautiful spectacle of 
colors from deep greens and bright azure in this famous AVA of Alexander Valley which lies just north 
of Healdsburg in Sonoma County. Some folks say that if Mother Nature were a winemaker, she would 
live in the Alexander Valley.  Wines coming this area tend to be rich and voluptuous due to the area's 
generally warm climate and showcase a distinctive chocolate note, particularly in Cabernet and that is 
what you get with this gem of wine. 
Ruby in color the 2020 Cabernet Sauvignon is easily recognizable as classic Alexander Valley with 
medium body, great fruit flavors and smooth, structured tannins. The wine has earthy aromas of cassis, 
plum, cherry, oak and slight chocolate. In the glass there are lush flavors of cherry, cassis, and 
blackberry but is lifted and vibrant on the nose. Its silky mouthfeel will pair wonderfully with grilled or 
pan seared beef, lamb or tuna!

"Once again, the bell tolls at Campanology Brewing, and this time, it tolls for a ripe, refreshing, and superbly 
sweet-tart Peach Ale! Made in the style of a traditional Berliner Weisse, with a light, wheaty body and distinctly 
sour notes, the beer experts at Campanology have boosted each batch with a complement of peach purée and 
both apple and pineapple juice. Every sip of this limited run Ale has a bright, juicy, and inviting mix of sweet 
and sour, making it the ideal choice for tipping back during the sunny season of late spring/early summer.

Ably balanced and eminently easy-drinking, this Peach Ale pairs quite peachy-keen-ily with all sorts of 
summer fare. We're especially fond of serving it with grilled, marinated shrimp, Thai-style curries, al pastor 
tacos, or spicy ceviche with plenty of Truly Tortilla Chips [sku 58073] for scooping. Best served nice and 
chilled, Campanology's Peach Ale is also a great option for bringing out during barbecues and pool parties. 
Just be sure to grab a four-pack while you have the chance: just like the summer itself, this Peach Ale won't be 
around forever!

"Like all of the products we sell, Trader Joe's takes beers very seriously. This is well illustrated in Josephsbrau 
Bavarian Style Hefeweizen. Though it's made for us through a partnership with one of the foremost crafter 
breweries of the West Coast, it's brewed with imported malt and hops under the strictest interpretation of the  
Reinheitsgebot, a strict set of laws from 16th century Bavaria that determined that beers could only contain 
barley, hops, and water. Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for 
other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe.

Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally 
means: ""wheat yeast""). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen 
including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer's unfiltered golden color, combined 
with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself. It also pairs 
extremely well with a grilled Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst [sku 57632] or our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage 
[sku 28287].

the world. Chateau Fonbadet is, literally, next door to arguably the most famous, prestigious, collectible and 

expensive wines of them all, Chateau Mouton Rothschild. Since inheriting the estate from her father, Pascale 

Peyronie has been continuously improving her wines, with great results. This 2019 vintage of the second, or 

B, wine from Fonbadet, is spectacular! The wine is made from 40% Cabernet Franc, 30% Cabernet 

Sauvignon and 30% Merlot. The nose is ripe red fruits, black cherries and black currants, with hints of 

violets and tobacco. It has a dark ruby color, with a dense and complex body, finishing with silky smooth 

tannins and a nice touch of oak. When we tried it, all we could say was WOW! And not just us, Decanter 

tried it and gave it a score of 97/100. That's the kind of score that would come with a Whole Paycheck price 

at other places. But this is Trader Joe's, so priced for everyday consumption.  The wine can be drunk now,

"One of our winery partners, who farms their own land and makes great wine, was long on their 
Chardonnay and made us an offer we could not refuse. Since then, we've brought back additional 
vintages because while Paso Robles is not necessarily known for Chardonnay, this is a mighty fine one! 
We loved its tropical fruit notes and round character and think our customers will continue to be blown 
away by the value in this bottle. 

 
Paso Robles benefits from the largest swing between high daytime and low nighttime temperatures of 
any region in California as a result of the cool marine air that flows east through the Templeton Gap 
and south along the Salinas River Valley from the Monterey Bay. The region's summer is characterized 
by warm, clear days, generally unencumbered by clouds, fog or severe winds. This temperature 
fluctuation is considered a key by winemakers and wine grape growers to attain the intense varietal 
character displayed in wine grapes from the area. This Chardonnay showcases what this region can 
really do to a white's flavor - lively and crisp with a refreshing and round finish. The all-tank 
fermentation adds to the freshness even further.",75343,,750 mL,,Petit Reserve Chardonnay Paso Robles 2021,7.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/petit-reserve-chardonnay-paso-robles-2021-075343,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Petit Reserve Chardonnay Paso Robles 2021"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Petit Reserve Chardonnay Paso Robles 2021\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/75343.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":7.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Bibulous"",""Cheese Board"",""Date Night"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"Nestled amidst the magnificent landscape of Washington's Columbia Valley AVA, the Wahluke [wah-LUKE] 
Slope is well known for its magnificent red grape varietals. Its dry days, cool nights, and rocky soils offer 
ideal conditions for cultivating world-class grapes-and with the right precision and care, world-class grapes 
become world-class wines. We are thrilled to introduce Trader Joe's Reserve Syrah, Lot #237 from Wahluke 
Slope, a bold, yet deftly balanced Syrah that epitomizes the essence of this extraordinary terroir.

Made with 100% organic Syrah grapes, this garnet-hued wine exudes effusive raspberry and red rose on the 
nose, with a subtle note of cola. The palate is replete with notes of plush boysenberry, framed by firm tannins 
and a touch of white pepper. The long, clean finish beckons another sip, especially when paired with a Tarte 
Aux Champignons [sku 93281], roasted root veggies, or a plate of our Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati [sku 72525]

"We have, of course, carried a number of Reserve Cabernet Sauvignons from Washington. Frankly, we love 

Washington Cabs. Eastern Washington is a special place where lots of good and great Cab is grown. Unlike 

Western Washington, famous for rain, rain and more rain, the Eastern side of the Cascade Mountains is a 

desert - the mountains trap all that Coastal Moisture on the Coastal side. The grapes grow in vineyards with 

long, sunny days, and cool evenings. The result is intense, concentrated flavor, and serious wines. And the 

vineyards get exactly the right amount of water, irrigated courtesy of the giant Columbia River, which gives 

the Valley its name. 

When we tasted what is now Trader Joe's Reserve 2017 Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, we fell in 

love. We hadn't sourced wine from this producer before, but we definitely will again.  

The wine is dark and full bodied, with rich, ripe fruit, notes of red plum, cocoa and delicately spiced oak.

Merlot has for centuries been considered one of the greatest wine grape varietals and has been the primary 

companion grape to Cabernet Sauvignon in some of the world's most desirable wines. Monterra Merlot 

expresses the best of what Merlot can be. This wine comes from the Monterey vineyards of one of our 

trusted wine partners that is renowned for growing Merlot since the early 90's. Fast forward 30 years, and 

what's old is new again. The current vineyard is in its 20th year and producing bold bright gorgeous fruit.

"Our TJ Reserve label is ""reserved"" for special wines we feel are unique values and truly represent the qualities 
of their appellation. Year in, year out, the TJ Reserve North Coast Brut is always one of our favorite holiday 
wines, and after taking a look at just how much we sell every of it year, we realized that it might be time to 
take it up a notch. So we turned to the same Sonoma Winery that makes our North Coast Brut specially for 
us, and asked them if they have anything more premium on-hand. They responded with this delightful Brut, 
made with elegant Sonoma Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. This Platinum level Brut marks a new 
height in luxurious, easy drinking. It's a mere fraction of the cost of other bubblies of its caliber. It's a very 
limited lot so snatch it up while you can! 

 

Winemakers Notes: 
The Sonoma Coast covers 750 square miles, from the Mendocino County line in the north to the Sonoma-
Marin border in the south. Adjacent to the Russian River Valley, portions of the Sonoma Coast offer a unique

"Each year our Egg Nog [sku 47904] and Light Egg Nog [sku 47906] make their appearance on our shelves-both 
satisfying on their own, dreamy in a latte, and incredibly indulgent in a French toast recipe. Customers rejoice 
at their return as heralds of the holiday season. Rounding out our nog-nificent offerings this season is Trader 
Joe's Wine Based Egg Nog-the classic holiday wine-tail, mixed and ready to drink!
 
Made exclusively for us in California, each bottle of Wine Based Egg Nog is a pre-mixed, holiday party in a

real cream. It's a sweet, convivial, ready-to-enjoy concoction that puts guests in the holiday spirit the moment 
it's poured into their glasses. Like its liqueur-based counterpart, this luxuriously smooth Nog is divine when 
added to a latte. Try it blended with ice cream for a merry, adult milkshake. Or, throw on some holiday tunes 
and enjoy it a la carte while wrapping presents by a cozy fire. During nog season (approximately November to 
late December), you'll find this Wine-Based beverage nestled near our other wines.

"Napa is definitely the ""movie star"" of California wine regions, and big Napa Cabs, which is the 

predominance of what Napa produces, come with the biggest price tags. But it's the much larger AVAs of 

Sonoma and Monterey, that each produce far more premium wine than Napa, and a much more diverse range 

of wines from their variety of microclimates. Monterey, in particular, has vineyard that are amongst both the 

hottest, and coldest, in California, and everything in between. But, of course, the varietal most associated 

with Monterey's 40,000 acres of vineyards, understandably, is Pinot Noir. Northern Monterey County is 

windy, coastal cool climate, hillside vineyards. And Pinot Noir (and Chardonnay) thrive. Trader Joe's 2020 

Petit Reserve Monterey Pinot Noir was produced by one of our larger winery-partners, who produce and sell 

us consistently top quality wines at outstanding prices - that's our kind of partner! Trader Joe's 2020 Petit 

Reserve Monterey Pinot Noir is a fruit forward wine. You immediately smell dark berries and red plum. The 

flavor is raspberry and wild strawberry with subtle spice notes in the bright finish. It's lively and lovely. This

"The panel loves Pinot Noir! And the panel loves the Napa Valley!  

Napa is the most famous of California's Wine Valley's, and for a reason.  While most of the up-valley grape-

growing and wine-making is focused on big, rich, and often incredibly expensive, Cabernet Sauvignon. The 

very temperate lower Napa Valley, which opens to the bay and those famous cool breezes, is Pinot Noir (and 

Chardonnay) focused.  

The reason we, and our customers, love Pinot Noir, is the best are balanced and approachable - and 

compliment the meal. When we tasted the wine that is now Trader Joe's 2020 Grand Reserve Napa Pinot 

Noir, we were hooked. The wine is full of fresh strawberries and cherries, with a mouth-watering crispness 

balanced with soft vanilla notes. The wine has a medium body, a silky texture and a lingering finish. It's 

yummy!

"Chardonnay. What is it about Chardonnay? Some folks talk about anything but Chardonnay. Others the 

sophistication of non-Chardonnay white wines. But, frankly, Chardonnay has long dominated white wine 

sales. In fact, we sell more Chardonnay than all other white wines combined. And that's been true for 

decades. And the reason is, Chardonnay, at its best marries bright, ripe, round citrusy fruit notes with firm 

acidity. It's neither overpowering, nor underwhelming. It can stand on its own, and pairs well with food. In 

short, it's enjoyable. Of course the panel samples zillions of Chardonnays every year. And for sure one of the 

AVAs that consistently yields some of the finest Chardonnays is Santa Lucia Highlands. This is the best of 

Monterey, the grapes ripen in the sunny days, then fog and coastal breezes predictably flow in between the 

Santa Lucia and Gabilan ranges, and cool the grapes producing that beautiful acidity. When we tasted what is 

now Trader Joe's 2020 Reserve Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay, we loved it. Tropical fruit in the nose, 

gives way to notes of pear, vanilla and toasted oak. This is 100% Chardonnay, 100% Barrel Fermented and 

100% delicious! 

Great Chardonnays from Santa Lucia Highlands can cost $20, or more, but we're Trader Joe's, so not a 

chance. Try Trader Joe's 2020 Reserve Santa Lucia Highlands Chardonnay with Pasta and Cream sauces,

"Straight from the lush vineyards of northwest Portugal's Vinho Verde region comes a spritely little 

number that'll have your taste buds dancing a lively jig! This wine is a vivacious and zesty white that 

practically twirls out of the bottle, eager to enliven your senses. With a pale green-yellow hue reminiscent of 

springtime meadows, it beckons you in with a crisp, citrusy fragrance kissed by hints of white flowers and 

mineral notes, carries on with a zippy acidity that's perfectly balanced by a touch of sweetness and a lively 

spritz of effervescence.  

This charming Vinho Verde hails from the coolish northwestern borders of Portugal where the terroir 

is simply sublime for producing these light, frisky whites. The grapes are handpicked in the region's granite 

soils, misty ocean breezes, and mild temperatures conspire to create a lip-smacking acidity and lively 

character in the grapes. An expert blend of regional staples like Loureiro, Pederna, and Azal, the Espiral 

captures the quintessential Vinho Verde spirit with its zingy freshness and featherweight 9% alcohol. 

What to sip this sprightly gem with? We'd suggest leaning into its joyful, warm weather vibes with some 

seasonal fares. A platter of briny oysters or other fresh seafood would be splendid, as would some zesty 

ceviches or shrimp cocktail. Salads topped with zippy vinaigrettes, goat cheese, and fruits like melon or 

mango would also pair marvelously. Or take a cue from the Portuguese and enjoy it as the perfect refreshing 

apéritif while snacking on some briny green olives and flaky bacalhau fritters. However, you serve it, this 

vivacious vinho is pure sunny summertime bliss in a glass!",47536,,750 mL,,Espiral Vinho Verde,4.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/espiral-vinho-verde-047536,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Espiral Vinho Verde"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Espiral Vinho Verde\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":4.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"Rebuttel is certainly not the first California Chardonnay we've brought in - our customers 
love Chards from CA! What's great for us (and more, importantly, the customer) is that Chardonnay 
is one of the most reliably versatile varietals out there. Therefore, while last year at this time, we 
brought in the butteriest and toasty oakiest end of the Chard spectrum with Big Churn, this year we 
went the other way - a Rebuttal (or, in this case, a Rebuttel), if you will. This Chardonnay is elegant, 
dry and fruity with a just a hint of oak. This is truly a great value for top quality wine and since it's an 
ongoing item, you're safe to put in on your shopping list every week!

"With its distinctively smoky character and hints of sweet agave, it's no wonder that mezcal has gained quite a 
following in recent years. In response to this striking spirit's rise in popularity, we decided the time was right 
to bring in our own private label, and went straight to the source: a distillery in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico 
that performs every step of the processing, from the growing and harvesting of the agave, to the roasting and 
fermenting, and even the bottling, on-site. When they're done, they call it Espada Pequeña Mezcal, the newest 
addition to our spirits section.

To understand this Mezcal's appeal, it helps to know a little how it's made. First, our distillery partner takes 
their estate-grown agave and roasts it in conical, underground pits, a process which both releases the agave 
nectar from the plant and gives it its signature smoky notes (tequila, which is technically a kind of mezcal, has 
a similar process, but uses above-ground brick ovens for roasting, which results in far less smoke in the finished 
product). Then, their head mezcalero, a third-generation mezcal distiller, ferments the nectar using traditional 
methods passed down through the decades. The result is a sublimely smoky Mezcal, slightly sweet, a little 
green and savory, and with a satisfyingly citric edge. It's marvelously full-flavored when served straight up, and 
brings a tantalizingly smoky earthiness when mixed into cocktails. Other mezcals on the market may go for top

we're willing to wager that Simpler Times Pilsner is the perfect contender. For $3.49* (plus deposit where

"Not only is this great wine made from grapes from the Pays d'Oc IGP but at $4.99 a bottle it's a great 
wine to take to any event!  The carefully selected grapes of cabernet sauvignon and syrah brings ripe 
cherry aromas to your nose while bringing a hint of vanilla and a lingering finish to the mouth.  This is a 
great easy to drink cabernet-syrah crafted in the purest French tradition with a modern style. 

 
Winemakers Notes: 
The Cabernet Sauvignon and the Syrah come from a warm part of Languedoc, near Béziers. The 
naturally low yield and the climate allow the grapes to reach a complete phenolic ripeness and the wine a 
great smoothness. The vinification is carried out traditionally in concrete tanks, under controlled 
temperature. The wine is aged a few months with French oak staves. 
 
Crafted by our winemaker team, this red wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that is meant 
to create a modern style with a retro look. This vintage inspired Burgundy bottle is great with grilled

"Merlot. Yes, Merlot. Merlot has long gotten a bad rap. Merlot vines are hearty, easy to grow, and 
productive. The wines can range from easy-drinking, grape-y and approachable to intense, rich and 
delicious. (As opposed to the praise lavished on finicky, difficult to grow, unpredictable results Pinot 
Noir, we suppose.) Frankly, the ""complaints"" about Merlot are basically compliments. Merlot wines are 
consistently good to great. And the best still tend to be much less expensive than equally good 
Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Similarly, the Sonoma Valley, which is much larger and diverse than Napa, tends to produce equally 
wonderful wines that cost a fraction of the price of wines from the uber-prestigious Napa Valley. 
Enter Trader Joe's 2020 Reserve Sonoma Valley Merlot. When the panel first tasted the wine, from one 
of our favorite partners, we loved it. The wine is spectacular. Intense, complex ripe fruit, with notes of 
berries, cocoa and spice. The wine has silky smooth tannins and a firm backbone. It's balanced, rich 
and delicious. And because it's Merlot, and it's from the Sonoma, as opposed to the Napa, Valley (and 
because we're us, so we bought a LOT, put it in our label and paid cash), it's a fantastic value.

"This wine comes to us from one of our favorite producers, from Sonoma's Alexander Valley. The 
Alexander Valley is just above the Napa Valley (it's the first valley you reach through the mountains

of Sonoma. And Trader Joe's Reserve Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is a real gem. The wine is

"Anchors aweigh: the latest entry to our Boatswain (pronounced BOE-sun) line of beers is setting its sights 
on cloudier climes with this Hazy IPA! Crafted exclusively for Trader Joe's by an award-winning brewery in 
Wisconsin, this is a rich and alluringly aromatic India Pale Ale that conjurs complex notes of tropical fruit 
and citrus zest with every estimable sip. Its near-opaque, Hazy appearance is a visually-intriguing byproduct 
of adding hops late into the brewing process, which helps preserve the maximum amount of hoppy flavor and 
helps create an almost creamy mouthfeel. In other words, this is a seriously hoppy IPA.

We recommend drinking Boatswain Hazy IPA in a tall, frosted glass, paired up with spicy entrées or snacks 
- food that will hold its own next to this IPA's creamy bitterness. Something like our Mini Spicy Pumpkin 
Samosas [sku 68408], grilled shrimp glazed with Hot & Sweet Pepper Jelly [sku 96534], or a plate of Nashville 
hot chicken, fresh from a local food truck. The IPA may be Hazy, but one thing's clear: if you're looking for 
something bold, citric, and hoppy, it's time to get on board with Boatswain Hazy IPA!

"Trader Joe's 2020 Diamond Reserve Stag's Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon Lot 2 is a truly 
spectacular, world-class wine. The grapes for this wine are grown is one of, if not the, absolute best 
Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in the entire Napa Valley (and, arguably, the entire world). The wine is 
simply remarkable. Rich, velvety layer after layer of ripe Cabernet fruit. Dense, complex, satisfyingly 
rich. The wine is a powerhouse, packed with body and flavor, and will evolve and satisfy for many 
years to come. This is only the second, ever, wine we felt was worthy of the Diamond Reserve label, the

Winemakers Notes: 
Carneros (also known as Los Carneros) is an AVA (American Viticultural Area) that straddles parts of 
both Sonoma and Napa County, just north of San Pablo Bay. Due to the cool fog and breezes from the 
bay, the climate in this AVA is cooler and more moderate than some of the wine regions further north in 
Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley. This cooler climate has made Carneros attractive for the cultivation of 
Burgundy varietals like Chardonnay, Cremant de Bourgogne and, used in this wine, Pinot Noir. This wine 
is an amazing showcase of the best this AVA can offer!",94250,,750 mL,,Grand Reserve Pinot Noir Carneros Lot 23,12.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/grand-reserve-pinot-noir-carneros-lot-23-094250,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Grand Reserve Pinot Noir Carneros Lot 23"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Grand Reserve Pinot Noir Carneros Lot 23, 2021\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/94250.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":12.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"Our TJ Platinum Reserve label is ""reserved"" for very special wines we feel are unique values and truly 
represent the qualities of their appellation. This Carneros Pinot Noir is made by a winemaking veteran who 
routinely gets to work with some of the best Pinot Noirs in California. We're excited to offer this very limited 
lot to the lucky customers that snatch it up before it's gone!  
 

Winemakers Notes: 
In this blend, there are about ten different lots from our Estate vineyards, about 69.2% Mahoney Ranch 
in Napa Carneros and 23.56% from our other Carneros vineyards. We grow more than a dozen different 
clones of Pinot Noir, and in most vintages have about 20 individual lots. Most of the fermentations are 
small, between 4 and 12 tons. Our winemaking approach seeks to preserve fruit character, and create 
wines with pleasing acidity and softer tannin profiles. We tend to ferment cooler than many folks to 
accentuate fruit flavors, and use gentle cap management techniques to avoid harsh tannins. All these lots 
undergo malolactic fermentation in barrel, and many also see batonnage, or stirring of the yeast lees, in 
the barrel. Generally, the wines from the Estate see between 15-18 months in barrel (16 months in the 
case of this blend) long aging by California standards for Pinot Noir. We limit new oak to about 10-15% 
for most of our wines, though this blend has somewhat closer to 20% new French oak.

"Each year our Egg Nog and Light Egg Nog make their appearance on our shelves-both satisfying on their own, 
dreamy in a latte and incredibly indulgent in a French toast recipe. Customers rejoice at their return as heralds 
of the holiday season. Rounding out our offerings this season is Trader Joe's Egg Nog Liqueur-the classic 
holiday cocktail, now mixed and ready to drink.

Made for us exclusively in California, each bottle of Egg Nog Liqueur is filled with a mixture of spiced rum, 
brandy, and cinnamon, which is blended with a base of real cream-yes, really! It's a sweet, convivial concoction 
that puts guests in the holiday spirit the moment it's poured into their glasses-which will happen faster than 
ever, thanks to the fact that this boozy beverage is pre-mixed and ready to enjoy. 

Like its non-alcoholic counterpart, this luxuriously smooth, spiced Liqueur is divine when added to a latte. Try 
it blended with ice cream for a merry milkshake. Or, throw on some holiday tunes and enjoy it à la carte while 
wrapping presents by a cozy fire.

We're offering 750ml bottles of Trader Joe's Egg Nog Liqueur for the festive price of $7.99, but only during nog

"It's difficult to overstate how much we love a good bubbly. They're perfect for celebrating the Holidays, 
for ringing in the New Year, and even for just reveling in an evening in with good friends. And when you 
put that bubbly in a big, beautifully decorated, fantastically festive bottle? Now, that's truly something 
special. For example, our Incanto Prosecco 1.5L (SKU 97379), a magnificent magnum of Prosecco, is 
one of our all-time favorites - and our customers love it, too. We felt the time was right to bring in a 
French cousin to the Incanto, so we reached out to a trusted French winery partner (actually a collective 
of wineries and winemakers based in Alsace) that specializes in crisp, delicious sparklers. The result is the 
L'Eclat (French for ""burst,"" as in a ""burst of laughter""), a superbly delicious Blanc de Blancs wrapped in 
a bold and eye-catching design that positively shouts ""I'm celebrating something!"" Our panel instantly 
fell in love - twice the cheery, snappy effervescence, in a bottle that's practically already gift-wrapped, for

We introduced the Incanto 1.5L a few years ago after a chance 
meeting with a winery that specializes in Prosecco during a wine-
hunting trip in Italy. The winery itself is actually a co-op (many 
wineries belong and contribute grapes) and their resident 
winemaker is somewhat of a wizard with Sparkling wine.   
 
We were immensely impressed with their state-of-the-art facility, 
and their outstanding Proseccos only impressed us further.  We 
figured they would be the perfect partner to team up with for a 
large bottle of Prosecco for the holidays. Several years later, and 
the Incanto 1.5L is now a mainstay of our holiday wine selections 
and a consistent customer favorite every year. Need a 
recommendation for a customer who's hosting a dinner party? 
Look no further - the Incato Prosecco 1.5L is a perfect fit.

"The Santa Lucia Highlands AVA is an American Viticulture Area located in Monterey County, California. 
It is part of the larger Monterey AVA, and located in the Santa Lucia Mountains above the Salinas 
Valley. Over 2,300 acres of vineyards are planted in the AVA, some as high as 1,200 feet above sea 
level, with about half of them planted to the Pinot noir grape. The region enjoys cool morning fog and 
breezes from Monterey Bay followed by warm afternoons thanks to direct southern exposures to the 
sun, then cool evenings. The AVA is perfect for growing Pinot Noir (and Chardonnay), producing 
concentrated, complex, and well-structured Pinots. Trader Joe's 2020 Platinum Reserve Santa Lucia 
Highlands Pinot Noir is, simply put, a super wine. The flavor is dense, deep and textured. It's intense. 
But it's layers of smooth, ripe, drinkable Pinot Noir, with flavors of ripe cherries and berries. And the 
finish is firm and crisp, leaving you wanting more. And because we're Trader Joe's, it's just $14.99. The

"As the years have passed, Pumpkin Season at Trader Joe's has truly taken on a life of its own. Customers and 
crew anticipate the signals of the season with unabashed affection: bushel baskets filled to the brim with hard 
squash, vivid orange pumpkins waiting to be carved, and most importantly, the debut of pumpkin-inspired 
seasonal delights on our shelves that join stalwart standbys like TJ's Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372] and Pumpkin 
Pancake & Waffle Mix [sku 93044]. Here to join the fun for Pumpkin Season 2018 is Trader Joe's Pumpkin 
Spice Cream Liqueur.

Our Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur will immediately draw you in with its sweet aroma of warm vanilla and 
luxuriously velvety mouthfeel. This creamy cordial offers rich caramel flavors up front, followed by smooth 
pumpkin and pleasant spice notes on the finish. After one sip, don't be surprised if you feel the sudden urge to 
don a flannel, rake some leaves, and carve a pumpkin-it's truly the taste of fall!

Aside from obvious serve-and-sip enjoyment, Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur is the key ingredient for a boozy 
French toast or bread pudding. Pour it into a hot cup of coffee (or blend with iced coffee, if ""fall"" in your locale 
means temps plummet to a cool 85 degrees). Or, soak raisins in the Liqueur, and fold them into a batch of TJ's 
Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Baking Mix [sku 55267]-be sure to make an extra loaf for a neighbor to 
spread some cozy fall spirit!

You'll find 750 mL bottles of Trader Joe's Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur for $8.99 each (or per market), for 
a limited time in stores where we sell spirits.

"Trader Joe's Sta. Rita Hills 2020 Grand Reserve Pinot Noir is a great wine! We can't reveal all the 
details, but the majority of the wine comes from one of the most famous vineyards in the appellation, 
planted decades ago by one of the pioneers of the AVA. This wine is elegant, layered, delicate and 
complex. And then a small amount of Pinot from one of the newer, up and coming vineyards at the 
Southwestern End of the SRH appellation. This is a bigger, brighter, juicy and bold Pinot. Blended 
together, yum! Delicate and elegant, but with ripe fruit notes of bing and black cherry, and plum. The 
wine finishes with toasty oak and vanilla notes, with the classic firm acidic backbone of the region. It's 
everything you want in a great Sta. Rita Hills Pinot, except for the typically exorbitant price they tend 
to command. Enjoy with grilled flank steak, gyros, Cajun spiced salmon, spicy Thai or margarita pizza.",72601,,750 mL,,Grand Reserve Pinot Noir Sta.

"Have we taken the nautical nomenclature too far? What do ""boats"" have to do with beer? First, a quick tutorial: a 
boatswain (that's BOE-sun) is an unlicensed member of the deck department on a merchant ship. The boatswain 
supervises the other deck crew. The boatswain is a hard worker, reliable, and often goes unnoticed. Boatswain 
Double I.P.A. lives up to two of those three descriptors - once you have a taste of it, it certainly won't go 
unnoticed.

Brewed exclusively for Trader Joe's by an award-winning craft brewer in Wisconsin, this is a robust ale that's 
intensely hoppy - its recipe includes a boat-load of hops! - and includes just the right amount of malt to balance 
the hops' bitter profile. At 8.4% alcohol, this is not a brew for the faint of heart. What it is, however, is an I.P.A. 
for the serious craft beer drinker, the brew aficionado who's always looking for something new and interesting 
to drink. You know who you are. This one's for you. Sip it with spiced dishes like barbecue or Thai curries like 
Vegetable Panang Curry [sku 98680]. Try it with sharp cheeses like aged Cheddar or Grand Blue [sku 55344]. 

For years we sold Boatswain Double I.P.A. in 650ml bottles. Recently, we made the decision to offer it in 12 
ounce (355ml) cans instead. Opening up a 12 ounce can is less of a commitment than opening up a nearly-24 
ounce bottle, and you really can't beat our price of $4.99 (or per market), plus deposit where required, for a 
6-pack of cans. The serious beer geeks out there surely know that Trader Joe's is a reliable source for this kind of 
hard working value that won't go unnoticed.

"We've been searching for some time to find a high-quality 
producer to make a private label true Kentucky Bourbon.  Who 
knew how hard that was??   
 
At long last, we are able to present Trader Joe's Kentucky 
Bourbon Straight Whiskey.  This distiller actually makes one of the 
best branded Bourbons on the market.  We were excited when we 
tasted this and even more excited after seeing the final product.  
This is a significant value given that it is aged a minimum of 5 
years and should really complement our Bourbon selection. 

Bourbon Overview 
The word ""Bourbon"" derives from Bourbon County, KY (located in the central Bluegrass Region of 
Kentucky).  By law, all Bourbons must contain a ratio of at least 51 percent corn to other grains 
like wheat and most distillers use 65 to 75 percent corn.  Bourbon must be aged for a minimum 
of two years in new, white oak barrels that have been charred. Nothing can be added at bottling 
to enhance flavor, add sweetness or alter color. 
 
Straight Whiskey 
Straight bourbons are produced by the sour-mash method where ""backset"" (liquid from a 
previous distillation) is added to the mash in addition to yeast. The backset helps to make the 
next batch of bourbon similar to the previous ones by passing on some of the characteristics of 
the previous batches (this is similar to using a ""starter"" when making sourdough bread).",97401,,750 mL,,Kentucky Bourbon,14.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/kentucky-bourbon-097401,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Kentucky Bourbon"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":200,""name"":""Wine, Beer & Liquor"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":750,""sales_uom_description"":""mL"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":14.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"If you like makin' drinks at sunset,

If you blend or you shake,
Then I'm the rum that you've looked for,

Take a sip and escape.
-with apologies to Rupert Holmes

Avast, me hearties! If you're looking for a superb summer spirit that plays well with others, then say ""Ahoy!"" to 
Trader Joe's White Rum Of The Gods. Made of pure cane sugar and distilled in Barbados (aka the birthplace 
of rum), it's a clear, 80-proof (40% ABV) liquor that offers a soft hint of allspice in the nose, and a light caramel-
sweetness on the palate with a clean finish. This fairly neutral flavor profile makes it a marvelous mixing 
partner, whether you prefer a Daiquiri, Mojito, or of course, a Piña Colada.

After it's distilled in Barbados, this White Rum Of The Gods travels the high seas (and then the highways) 
in bulk via ""flexi-tanks"" to a bottling plant in Wisconsin. This reduces the cost of transportation, without 
sacrificing the quality and authenticity of what's inside the bottle-which is why we're able to offer 750mL 
bottles of Trader Joe's White Rum of the Gods for a few doubloons¿er, dollars lower per bottle than we've 
seen elsewhere. It's a swashbuckling value you'll only find in the Spirits section at your neighborhood Trader 
Joe's (where liquor is sold).

"Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey, by definition, must include a mashbill - the recipe of grains - that includes 51% 
- 80% corn. Most Kentucky Bourbon is made with rye as the second ingredient. Some, though, have a higher 
percentage of wheat than rye, and recently, these ""wheaters"" or ""wheated whiskeys,"" have been gaining in 
popularity and prestige. 

Our Kentucky Best Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a ""wheated"" Bourbon, and delivers the big, round body 
and full flavor that mark this style created by this mash. Kentucky Best is aged four years in new, charred 
American oak barrels; the finished result is an 80 proof Whiskey (40% alcohol) that's highlighted by notes of 
honey and butter, as well as hints of plums and raisins. Straight up or on the rocks, each sip finishes long and 
warm and lingers on your tongue. We especially enjoy slow-sipping Kentucky Best with a dessert spread of 
dark chocolate, sharp cheeses, and dried fruits. 

We're selling each 750mL bottle of Kentucky Best Straight Bourbon Whiskey for the tremendously delicious 
price of $11.99*. You'll find it haunting our spirits section.

"Leave it to Texas to suddenly become a serious contender in the global vodka scene. Indeed, since the state's craft 
liquor boom of the 2010's, Texas vodka has become a true force to be reckoned with, standing toe to toe with 
the likes of Poland and Russia. How, you ask? We like to think it's a combination of great local grains, traditional 
distilling methods, and a Texas-sized commitment to quality. All three are certainly present in Trader Joe's TX 
Vodka, a brand new spirit imbued with the Lone Star State's can-do spirit that you can only find at Trader Joe's.

Made for us by a trusted distillery partner in Houston, our new TX Vodka is made with corn to give it a lightly 
sweet, easy-going profile, then distlled six times to give it an impeccably smooth texture. In fact, we find its sweet-
smooth character makes it a great candidate for inclusion in simpler cocktails: simply mix an ounce or two with 
club soda, tonic water, or even our Sparkling Coconut Water with Yuzu [sku 63261] for a quick, clean, quencher. 
They say everything's bigger in Texas, but our price on TX Vodka certainly wouldn't make you think so: we're 
selling each 750 mL bottle for the phenomenal retail of $9.99*. Mosey on down to our spirits section and grab a

"Picton Bay Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc exemplifies the vibrant, aromatic style that has made this New 

Zealand region world-famous. On the nose, it offers an exuberant bouquet of ripe tropical fruits, including 

passion fruit, guava, and lychee, intertwined with zesty notes of lime and fresh-cut grass. The palate delivers 

a crisp, refreshing explosion of flavors, showcasing juicy grapefruit, gooseberry, and a hint of green bell 

pepper, all underpinned by a characteristic flinty minerality. 

 

This wine's distinctive character is a direct reflection of Marlborough's unique terroir. The cool maritime 

climate, with its abundant sunshine and long growing season, allows the grapes to develop intense flavors 

while retaining their natural acidity. The region's alluvial soils, rich in gravel and clay, impart a subtle 

mineral complexity to the wine, enhancing its depth and structure. 

 

Picton Bay Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is incredibly versatile when it comes to food pairings. Its bright 

acidity and herbaceous notes make it an excellent match for fresh seafood dishes, particularly oysters, grilled 

prawns, and seared scallops. It also pairs beautifully with goat cheese salads, asparagus risotto, and Thai-

inspired cuisine featuring lemongrass and cilantro. For a simple yet delightful pairing, enjoy it alongside a

"From the same wine producers as our Villa Cerrina Pinot Grigio, the Villa Cerrina Montepulciano 
D'Abruzzo offers just as much quality and old world elegance, and at an equally substantial value, as its 
sister. We've carried this brand for years, now (about a decade), and have continued to carry it for one 
simple reason: you won't find Montepulciano this excellent for anywhere near this low a price anywhere 
else on the market. Period. With its even-handed, fruity flavors, ample tannic structure, and utterly 
enticing aromas, the Villa Cerrina makes it a very easy-drinking wine. Have a customer looking for a great 
accompaniment to a low-key dinner party? The Villa Cerrina Montepulciano is always a reliable choice. 
 

Winemakers Notes: 
Montepulciano, the grape, produces wines with even, active aromas, pronounced tannins and low acidity. 
It is the second most widely grown native grape in Italy, and one of its most popular as well - 
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, from Italy's Abruzzo region, is considered one of Italy's top wine exports. 
The stems are separated from the grapes, which are softly pressed in cylinders under pressure gently

"Our customers, and the tasting panel, love Prosecco! And it's easy to taste why. Prosecco is the famed 
Northern Italian Sparkling wine that is crisp and bubbly, but with just the right touch of floral nose, 
fruitiness and a hint of sweetness. It tastes great and is too easy to drink. 
After many years of consideration, the Italian government now allows the wineries of Prosecco to 
make a Rose. Prosecco has always been made from one variety of grape, Glera, but for Rose, a small 
amount of Pinot Noir is allowed. Cecilia Beretta, long one of our favorite Prosecco producers, blends 
8.5% Pinot Noir with the balance of Glera. The result is delicious. All the fruit, aroma and hint of 
sweetness of traditional Prosecco, but with a touch more body and structure, and that beautiful

"Although whiskey continues to demand top billing in the spirits world, tequila has experienced a renaissance 
of its own, with a resurgence of artisan distillers creating superb quality product (albeit in limited amounts). 
Our product developers have procured a number of limited, regional tequila buys that fit this bill, all the while 
pursuing a partnership that could yield enough tequila auténtico for all of our customers to enjoy (all of our 
customers who shop in Trader Joe's where spirits are sold, of course). We're excited to say they've achieved this 
goal, with Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco, the newest addition to our private label spirits collection.

Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco is made for us by a family-owned distillery in Jalisco, Mexico, using processes 
that have been handed down over four generations. Jalisco's rocky soil produces blue agave with a higher sugar 
content than other growing regions-in turn, this carefully cultivated agave produces sweeter and fruitier 
tequila. Thanks to the gentle extraction and fermentation of the 100% blue agave juice, our Tequila Blanco is 
a smooth, bright spirit, offering notes of fresh lemon and black pepper with each sip, and a clean, crisp finish.

Thanks to its clean, zesty flavors and refreshing mouthfeel, Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco would be right at home 
in a tequila sunrise or margarita (on the rocks, with salt, if you please). And thanks to its incredible price of 
$19.99 per 750mL bottle, it can be right at home on your liquor shelf-at five dollars lower per bottle than prices 
we've seen elsewhere for tequila of this incredible quality. Find them with our other spirits.

"In 2018, we added a new twist to the phenomenon that is Charles Shaw Wine - due to some savvy negotiating 
on our part, and some seriously skilled winemaking on the part of our longtime partners, we were able to 
introduce Shaw Wines made with Organic Grapes and offer them at tremendously value-driven prices. We've 
offered a number of different varietals since then, and we always seem to run out of the current vintage before 
the next vintage is ready to bottle. We've recently launched Shaw Red Blend made with Organic Grapes, for 
two reasons. One, it's a really smooth, easy-drinking wine. And two, because it's crafted with a blend of grape 
varietals, we can (hopefully) keep it on the shelves even when the single-varietal wines are harder to find.

A rich, ruby-red hue suggests bold fruit flavors, and the Wine really delivers. Aromas of fresh fruit lead to 
berry-forward flavors, silky tannins, and a hint of toasted oak at the finish. This Red Blend was made for 
sipping with your favorite foods¿ we're thinking smoky barbecue, hearty mac & cheese, or buttery seafood 
dishes like shrimp scampi or cracker-crumb-crusted baked scallops. We're selling each 750mL bottle of Shaw 
Red Blend made with Organic Grapes for $3.99*, every day.

"When our tasting panel first tasted this vodka, the comments we heard most were ""mellow,"" ""clean-tasting,"" 
""crisp,"" and ""smooth."" We wholeheartedly agree with all of these assessments! Trader Joe's Small Batch Vodka 
10X Distilled comes to us from a small-batch distiller in the upper Midwest. It's distilled from corn, making it 
naturally gluten free (it's vegan, too, for those keeping track). The secret to the smooth flavor profile, though, 
begins with the water. Yep, the water. It's sourced from a natural, limestone-filtered aquifer about 1,300 feet 
below the distillery. The Vodka is Distilled 10 Times, to remove any and all impurities, and then charcoal 
filtered to ensure the cleanest, smoothest flavor. It's higher in alcohol than most vodkas, at 88 proof (44% 
alcohol), and yet, it comes without any of the ""heat"" often associated with such high alcohol spirits.

It also comes without the high price often associated with such high quality spirits. We're selling each 750mL 
bottle for $9.99, a terrific value you'll find only at Trader Joe's.

"Have we taken the nautical nomenclature too far? What do ""boats"" have to do with beer? First, a quick tutorial: a 
boatswain (that's BOE-sun) is an unlicensed member of the deck department on a merchant ship. The boatswain 
supervises the other deck crew. The boatswain is a hard worker, reliable, and often goes unnoticed. Boatswain 
American I.P.A. lives up to two of those three descriptors - once you have a taste of it, it certainly won't go 
unnoticed.

Brewed exclusively for Trader Joe's by an award-winning craft brewer in Wisconsin, this is an abundantly hoppy, 
respectably bitter ale, with just the right amount of malt to balance the crisp, hop-forward profile. At 6.7% 
alcohol, this is not a brew for the faint of heart. What it is, however, is an American I.P.A. for the serious craft 
beer drinker, the brew aficionado who's always looking for something new and interesting to drink. You know 
who you are. This one's for you. Sip it chilled while flipping burgers on the barbecue. Pair it with tangy Cave Aged 
Blue Cheese[sku 90798] or Raw Milk Aged Cheddar [sku 75227].

For years we sold Boatswain American I.P.A. in 650ml bottles. Recently, we made the decision to offer it in 
12-ounce (355ml) cans instead. Opening up a 12-ounce can is less of a commitment than opening up a nearly 
24-ounce bottle, and you really can't beat our price of $4.99 (or per market), plus deposit where required, for a 
6-pack of cans. The serious beer geeks out there surely know that Trader Joe's is a reliable source for this kind of 
hard working value that won't go unnoticed.

"Of course, the tasting panel LOVES Cabernet Franc. Genetically, Cabernet Franc is the parent 
varietal to both Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (as the name implies, Cabernet Sauvignon was 
made by crossing Cabernet Franc with Sauvignon Blanc¿and the rest, as they say, is history). And 
while the kids are now much more famous than the parent (as sometimes happens with humans, 
too). But given the rich, complex, well-structured wines that are made from Cabernet Franc grapes, 
maybe we should have just stuck with the original. When the panel tasted what is now Trader Joe's 
2022 Petit Reserve Paso Robles Cabernet Franc, we were hooked. The wine is bright, rich and 
vibrant. The nose is black cherry and plum, with the addition of mocha and toasty oak in the 
mouth. Because it's Cab Franc, the wine has lots of firm tannins and acidy. The result is a wine 
that's both full-bodied and smooth, but with enough zing that it leaves your mouth watering for 
more. It's also yet another example of how many great wines are coming out of Paso Robles now. 
Try a bottle (or at this price, two bottles) with your next grilled Ribeye. Cheers!
