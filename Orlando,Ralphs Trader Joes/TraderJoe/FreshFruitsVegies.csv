Trader Joe's Lacinato Kale is nutrient-dense, packed with vitamin C, calcium, fiber, 
antioxidants and beta-carotene.

"Delicata Squash is an oblong-shaped, yellow-green variety that's native to North and Central America. Sci-
entifically, it is Curcurbita pepo. Culinarily, it's a true treasure! Delicata is classified as a winter squash because 
when raw, its outer skin is hard like a butternut. Botanically, it's more closely related to summer squashes like 
zucchini; its skin isn't as tough as it first appears, and when you cook it, the skin becomes barely detectable. 
Because of this softer skin, Delicata doesn't store as well, or for as long, as other winter squash varieties, mak-
ing it an autumn treasure that's worth seeking out during its short tenure.

Because of its thin skin, Delicata Squash is easy to prepare in myriad ways. Its yellow-to-orange flesh is sweet, 
rich, and moist-so much so, in fact, that it's often called Sweet Potato Squash. It can be sliced lengthwise, 
seeds scooped out, and roasted, much like you'd do with an acorn or butternut squash. It can also be sliced 
into rounds (seeds removed from centers), seasoned simply with salt and pepper (or maple syrup or brown 
sugar) and baked. There's no need to peel-once cooked, it's easy to eat the skin. This particular squash also 
steams well, and can be cooked in the microwave to applause-worthy result. Also applause-worthy is our price 
of 99 cents for each Trader Joe's Delicata Squash. Because this is a truly seasonal fresh produce item, when 
it's gone, it'll be a while before it makes its way back.

"It would be really romantic to say that Spaghetti Squash was cultivated in late Renaissance Italy, when Reu-
benesque human figures dominated frescoes, making for overly self-conscious citizens, who subsequently 
sought out low calorie, low carb versions of spaghetti noodles. In actuality, this Squash sometimes cleverly 
known as ""squaghetti,"" was simply named for its cooked texture, which resembles long, thin noodles.

Whether you motivation is ample nude figures in Flemish Renaissance paintings, or just the inability to fit into 
the jeans you wore last fall, Spaghetti Squash does provide a healthy and yummy, seasonal alternative to the 
typical plate of carbs.

To create a spaghetti substitute plate, simply cook your Squash until tender. Microwaving for 5-10 minutes 
works just fine, but you can also bake it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes, or until soft. After it cools a little, 
carefully cut the softened Spaghetti Squash in half lengthwise, remove the seeds, and use a fork to loosen the 
spaghetti-like fibers that have emerged during cooking. Next, lightly sauté the ""squaghetti"" with a little oil in a 
pan on the stovetop. This will allow some of the excess moisture to steam off. Finally, put it in a bowl and top 
with your favorite pasta sauce!

As we enter the season of holiday feasts, here's a meal that is not only delicious, but that can also serve to bal-
ance out all those extra helpings of potatoes and stuffing that you know you're going to have. Each Spaghetti 
Squash is just $2.29 in our West Coast stores, and $2.69 elsewhere.

"""Thin-skinned"" isn't generally seen as a sought-after quality-unless you're talking about Yellow Squash. Its 
thin skin makes this summer squash ideal for slicing into ribbons and tossing with lemon juice, halved Organic 
Mixed Medley Cherry Tomatoes [sku 50214], and a few spoonfuls of TJ's Basil Pesto Sauce [sku 75825]. Beneath 
that bright yellow, thin-skinned exterior is slightly seedy, tender flesh that develops an ever-so-faint vegetal 
sweetness when roasted or sautéed, and holds up nicely when sliced into planks, drizzled with Organic Extra 
Virgin Garlic Flavored Olive Oil [sku 96177], and charred on the grill. Yellow Squash makes for a tasty, lower-
carb stand-in for pasta when spiralized and tossed with Rosatella Pasta Sauce [sku 76262], as well.

Because ""peak season"" changes depending on the growing region and season, we offer Yellow Squash from 
California as well as Mexico to ensure we can provide top-notch quality and flavor throughout the year. 
Regardless of where its grown, you're sure to enjoy the incredible value we offer on one-pound packages of 
Trader Joe's Yellow Squash. You'll find them in our refrigerators, every day.

"We have a contingent of beet fans who've celebrated our Steamed and Peeled Baby Beets [sku 72774] since the 
moment they were first introduced. However, there's a certain type of beet fan-a hardcore beet enthusiast, 
one might say-who still wants more. For those who revel in the pleasure and versatility of raw, round, red 
roots, we've got good news: Trader Joe's Organic Beets have arrived!

There's a good deal of beauty in these beets, starting with their appearance-scarlet bulbs, hand harvested and 
trimmed in the fields. They are rinsed and gently tumbled over brush rollers to remove the dirt-no synthetic 
fertilizers or pesticides to wash away, here! One more rinse and the beets are bagged by hand and shipped to 
our warehouses.

Once they land in your hands, you'll discover the amazing culinary flexibility of these earthy, slightly sweet 
gems. Fresh beets can be prepared in almost any way imaginable: Bake them. Boil them. Grill them, or steam 
them. Leave them raw and grate, or shred them into salads. Use a mandoline to make large, thin slices that you 
can oven roast for a colorful alternative to potato chips. Use them in baked goods, stir-frys, smoothies, and 
just about anything else your brain and hands can cook up.

Beat the bushes all you like, but you won't find trimmed and bagged raw beets elsewhere-certainly not at our 
special price of $1.49 for each one-pound bag. (That's the West Coast price. The price on the East Coast, and 
in the Midwest and Southeast is $1.69.) Yay, beets!

"""Onion,
 luminous flask,
 your beauty formed
 petal by petal...""
  -Pablo Neruda, Ode to the Onion
 
It would be difficult to overstate just how important onions are to global cuisine. Nearly every culinary tradition 
the world over relies on onions in some form or another, and they often serve as the very bedrock of flavor that 
dishes are built upon. Noted for their sweetness, Vidalia Onions are a particularly essential allium, which is 
why we're proud to offer them in convenient, two-pound bags during the spring and summer months.

While our valiant Vidalias can be used in any application that calls for an onion, they're particularly great for 
roasting, caramelizing, and quick-pickling-all of which will accentuate their natural sweetness. Raw, they're 
excellent for topping sandwiches, burgers, and hot dogs, and make an awesome ingredient for salads, salsas, 
and skewers. For an easy, out-of-this-world confit, try cooking them low and slow in a skillet with butter, sugar, 
and a touch of red wine until they reach a super dark, golden brown.

"We'd like to extol the many virtues of Trader Joe's Organic English Cucumbers. These are long, thin cucumbers 
with very few seeds and thin skins. Unlike most commercially cultivated cucumbers, these are not waxed, so 
you can eat the skin - you'll want to give them a quick wash, of course. Because of the scarcity of seeds, this 
variety is easier on the stomach and less bitter than other cucumbers - this has led some to call these ""burpless"" 
cukes.  Really. Can't make this stuff up, folks.  

We get a lot of questions about why they're shrink-wrapped, and it's directly related to the 'cukes being ""not 
waxed."" Once harvested, these Organic English Cucumbers have to travel to get to your neighborhood Trader 
Joe's, and their unwaxed nature leaves them vulnerable to the elements. The shrink-wrap keeps them safe, and 
ensures consistent quality when you get them home.

Speaking of when you get them home, you can use Organic English Cucumbers anywhere you'd use any other 
type of cucumbers - in a salad, as a healthy snack, stuffed into a pita sandwich with hummus and tomatoes, 
blended with tomatoes into a cool, refreshing gazpacho, or double up the cukey goodness by dipping them in 
our Tzatziki Dip [sku 20405]. We're selling them for $2.49 each - a price that will leave you feeling cool as a

"Imagine, for a moment, that it's a busy weeknight, and you're on dinner duty. You have a protein all picked out, 
maybe a standby starch at the ready, but you're still in need of a leafy green. Wouldn't it be nice to have some 
veggies prepped for a quick sauté or stir-fry? Wouldn't it be even better if those veggies offered a variety of 
flavors and textures, even before being sauced? Well, we've got some excellent news for you: Trader Joe's Stir 
Fry Veggie Blend has arrived!

Pre-washed, pre-chopped, and ready-to-go for the pan, skillet, or wok, our Stir Fry Veggie Blend features a  
well-balanced mix of broccoli florets, napa cabbage, bok choy, and snow peas. They only take a minute or two of 
stir-frying to take on a delicately crisp, al dente texture, and are particularly suited for pairing with nutty, spicy, 
or even sweet flavors-like what you'll find in our Organic Toasted Sesame Oil [sku 65636], Green Dragon Hot 
Sauce [sku 54861], and Soyaki [sku 78555], respectively. And since they're so affordable and easy to prepare, 
you have a little more room in your schedule and budget to get a little more fancy with your protein-how 
about some White Miso [sku 73814]-glazed salmon, or Thai Peanut Satay [sku 77247]-braised tofu, perhaps?

"A hybrid of citron, regular lemons, and mandarins, Meyer Lemons resemble standard lemons in taste and 
appearance, but feature a thinner, smoother rind and a sweeter, less acidic taste-making them highly-sought-
after when they're in season... and it's Meyer Lemon season right now, at your neighborhood Trader Joe's!

The versatility of Meyer Lemons cannot be overstated. The juice of this California grown-citrus lends a bright 
but not overwhelming acidity to salad dressings and pasta dishes, and a pleasant, lemony note to mixed drinks, 
smoothies, and desserts. And don't forget about the rind-fresh Meyer Lemon zest is fantastic folded into 
whipped cream, stirred into yogurt, or sprinkled atop freshly baked ricotta cookies (visit traderjoes.com for the 
recipe!). You'll find one-pound bags of Trader Joe's Meyer Lemons in our produce section through roughly 
the end of March.

"The red grapefruit is a large citrus fruit related to the orange, lemon and

referring to the inside, pulp color of the fruit. The red variety is seedless

"In late nineteenth century Europe, oranges were expensive and rare, a special gift given to children in their 
holiday stockings. And while our Josie's Mandarins may not be as rare as their predecessors, they're just as 
capable of delivering sweetness and sunshine with every bite. Smaller than the standard navel variety, these 
seedless, handheld orbs possess an easy-to-peel rind and candy-sweet citrus flavor that make them an ideal 
snack or lunchbox addition for kids and kids-at-heart (and unlike candy, they won't melt in your purse or 
pocket). Their juice and zest add delightful complexity to an olive oil cake (visit traderjoes.com for the recipe!). 
Additionally, their vivid orange hue adds an air of tropical glamour to a centerpiece or gift basket- or, in a 
nod to history, a stocking! 

Throughout the year, we offer two-pound bags of Josie's Mandarins for a super-sweet value in our produce 
sections. They're grown in California's San Joaquin Valley and/or in Marrakesh, Morocco from roughly 
November through April, and Chile and/or South Africa from about May through October. Varieties shipped 
change throughout the seasons, and may include Clemenule, Page, Tango, and W. Murcott (fun fact: Morocco 
just so happens to be the birthplace of the W. Murcott variety!) No matter which variety you've got on (or in) 
your hands, you can count on each bag to contain the sweetest, juiciest Mandarins in town.

"The cranberry is an acidic berry related to blueberries and huckleberries, native to North 

America. Although many think of cranberries as a Thanksgiving treat, Native Americans 

actually enjoyed cranberries long before the Pilgrims arrived in this country. 

There are so many ways to enjoy Trader Joe's Fresh Cranberries. You can (of course) whip 

up your own cranberry sauce to dress your turkey, they also taste delicious in muffins, 

stuffing, or baked with pork or chicken, to name a few ideas. Or, if you'd rather gaze at them 

than eat them, they look terrific around the base of a candle in a hurricane lantern. 

 These berries are high in antioxidants and phytonutrients, which can be helpful in preventing 

urinary tract infections, and are also thought to help fight heart disease, cancer, stomach 

ulcers, and periodontal gum disease.

"Cranberry sauce connoisseurs generally fall into one of two groups-the folks who swear by the can and the 
can only, and those who prefer to make theirs from scratch. If you fall into the latter group, you'll be delighted 
to learn that we offer Organic Cranberries in our produce section during the holiday season. 

Starting in spring, Organic Cranberries are grown on trailing vines in cranberry bogs (that's grower-speak 
for marshes & wetlands). They're cultivated in colder regions, including Wisconsin and Quebec, where sandy 
soil allows roots to go deep. The cold weather comes early, and while this makes for a shorter growing season, 
it naturally permits fewer insects, eliminating the need for insecticides. And though the crops are smaller, the 
Cranberries are more robust, boasting quintessentially tart flavor and a striking ruby hue.

Our Organic Cranberries are harvested in the fall and shipped to your neighborhood Trader Joe's, where you 
can buy them in conveniently portioned 12-ounce bags. There are so many uses-you'll want to grab more 
than one bag to simmer into a super sauce, bake into Cornbread Mix [sku 32809], deck out your Thanksgiving 
tablescape, garnish glasses of chilled sparkling wine...

"Mirepoix is simply a ready-to-use blend of some basic ingredients-carrots, onions, & celery-just about every 
cook uses. Here, these three common ingredients have been washed, peeled, and-most importantly-chopped 
into a ready-to-use size, layered, and packaged in a recyclable, see-through tub. All that prep work¿ done. Just 
think about all the extra time you'll have to focus on your culinary creations (or finishing that long-neglected 
novel) with these ingredients at the ready. Many cooks swear by Mirepoix as the essential start to soups,

"Watermelons have become such an integral part of the American summertime food scene, it seems that many 
people have it in their heads that these sweet melons are an American creation.  If only we could take credit. 
Alas, the watermelon appears to have originated in Africa's Kalahari Desert, with ancient hieroglyphics placing 
the first recorded harvest in Egypt about 5,000 years ago. While we didn't invent watermelons, we sure can 
enjoy them! 

Trader Joe's Seedless Watermelons are fresh, ripe and ready for eating! What warm weather get-together 
would be complete without the decorative and delicious addition of fresh Watermelon? Slice them into wedges 
or pie-shaped slices; or halve them, hollow out and refill with watermelon balls. 

Here's a little insider information: the secret to great watermelon is all in the thumping and the scratching. 
Huh? That's right, thumping and scratching. When you ""thump"" the melon you should get a hollow sound, and 
the rind should be dull and easy to ""scratch."" Also, be sure to find the yellow ""field spot,"" the place where the 
watermelon rested on the ground, soaking up the sun prior to harvest.

 Still unsure? At Trader Joe's, we'll be happy to do the thumping and scratching for you. Just ask. Trader Joe's

"Aptly enough for its emerald-evoking name, Trader Joe's Little Gem Lettuce may just be the new crown jewel 
of our Produce section. The result of cross-breeding between romaine and butter varietals, Little Gem has all 
the crisp, satisfying bite of romaine, with the tenderness and mild, sweet flavor of butter lettuce. This best-of-
both-worlds combo makes it a real rarity among leafy greens-a hidden Gem, if you will-and opens it up to 
a remarkably wide range of uses within the kitchen. As it turns out, a Little Gem goes a long way!

As a salad green, its toothsome texture and delicate flavor interact wonderfully with all kinds of dressings: 
try it with a creamy blue cheese, a light and nimble vinaigrette, or our herby and aromatic Green Goddess 
[sku 59991]. In fact, Little Gem leaves are so fit for holding onto various dressings and sauces, that we also 
recommend using them as a vehicle for appetizer dips, hummus, or tapenades. They're hearty enough to act 
as lettuce cups and wraps for various proteins, and durable enough to be halved and grilled on the barbecue (a 
little char brings out their sweetness even more). Each bag comes with three heads of Lettuce-in other words, 
these Little Gems are one great big value.

"To have a cut, pre-washed bag of greens is a luxury that many cooks today might take for granted. Before 
such an invention, one had to chop the head, rinse the leaves, rinse them again (and maybe again), and then 
dry them using either the slow 'air-dry' technique-or far too many paper towels. So¿ let us give thanks for 
bagged lettuce-specifically Trader Joe's Organic Romaine & Chicory Blend. 

This Blend pairs crisp leaves of Organic Romaine with two members of the somewhat bitter (in flavor, not 
attitude) Chicory family-namely frilly, green Organic frisée (also known as curly endive) and sturdy leaves of 
burgundy-red, white-veined Organic radicchio. Their peppery, slightly spicy notes are pleasantly balanced by 
cool and crisp Romaine leaves. When combined, this Organic Blend of greens makes for a fast, fresh base for 
your favorite salad, and lends a thrilling counterpoint of texture when paired with rich, savory foods-think 
crisp bacon and a poached egg or sautéed Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667],. For added drama, drizzle 
them with Balsamic Vinaigrette [sku 72499] and pile atop a Mushroom & Truffle Flatbread Pizza [sku 90538] 
with abandon.

"Let's get right to the heart of it, shall we? Simply put, hearts of romaine are the most desirable part of the lettuce.  
Maybe it's the crunch. Maybe it's the easy-going, ever-so-slightly bitter flavor. Maybe it's the fact, with, Trader 
Joe's Romaine Hearts, all the work has been done. With no dark, outer leaves to trim away, you can use the 
whole heart, and simply enjoy the fruits of this verdant, versatile vegetable. 

Romaine, the modern descendant of the oldest of all lettuce types, adds a delightful, crunchy texture to mixed 
green salads. In fact, it's the lettuce of choice for a Caesar, Niçoise, or Cobb salad-a triple threat, if we've ever 
seen one. Romaine leaves bring excellent crunch to a burger or sandwich, and are an excellent option for using 
as a wrap or lettuce cup. Did you know? Romaine Hearts can even be grilled! Wash the whole Heart, then 
split it in half and brush with olive oil, grill just until char marks appear, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
serve with or without salad dressing. Now that's what we call Heart-warming!

This is an especially exciting arrival, one we long for during those times of the year when farm-fresh peaches 
are more fantasy than reality: two pounds of big, beautiful, flavorful Yellow Peaches packed in an easy-to-carry 
bag, for an excellent price.

These Yellow Peaches are shipped to our stores very cold, so they stay as fresh as possible. This keeps the fruit 
firm-don't make the mistake of thinking the fruit isn't ripe. It's really ripe. Just leave it out at room temperature 
for 24-36 hours to let the fruit soften and allow the bright aromas to shine through. We promise it's worth the

summer dessert. Enjoy them often, while they last.

"Available for a woefully short stint during late summer, Fresh Figs are among the last truly seasonal produce 
items around, and, thus, their appearance is cause for unbridled enthusiasm. If you have yet to enjoy the simple 
beauty of a ripe fig, with just one bite, you'll understand why fervent fig fans are known to text one another in 
triumph at the first sighting of the season. Figs' delicate skins conceal a tender, soft pink flesh within that boasts 
a slightly jammy texture and mouthwatering, honeyed sweetness.

Figs are natural foils for savory summer cheese boards, juicy burgers, and crisp salads. Their sweetness can be 
further concentrated when featured in baked goods. You can also capture their proverbial lightning-in-a-bottle 
essence and cook them down into a jam to enjoy all year long. However you choose to get your fig on, don't

"Trader Joe's Organic Herb Salad Mix includes a variety of fresh, Organic greens and vibrant Herbs. Red & 
green oak leaf, tango, lolla rosa, and butter lettuces are mixed in with red & green chard, mizuna, arugula, 
radicchio, spinach, kale, and frisee. Cilantro, parsley, and dill add some herby verve, helping to set this Salad 
Mix apart with its unique combination tastes and textures.*

Not only have we selected and trimmed the greens and Herbs for you, we have also triple washed them. 
This means you just need to open the bag, pour it in a bowl, and add your own accoutrements, as desired. 
The options are almost endless, but you might start with some halved TJ's Organic Mini Heirloom Tomatoes 
[sku 91008], sliced Organic Persian Cucumbers [sku 91838], and a drizzle of our Organic Italian Dressing [sku 
67698]. Fresh and delicious!

*Note: Exact ingredients may vary from time to time, since we only include the freshest available greens and herbs.

"For all the talk about ""super"" foods and ""super"" greens in particular, there's one that routinely gets left out of 
the conversation. Spinach. Spinach may not be hip or trendy, but it's a stalwart standby that always lives up 
to expectations. Cultivated stateside since the early 19th century, spinach had been a European staple for a 
thousand years before that. It was in the 20th century that spinach first got its ""superfood"" status - from a comic 
strip character, no less! And while it was silly when Popeye's muscles suddenly bulged after eating a can of 
spinach, there was also, in fact, some truth to that story. 

At Trader Joe's, we have fresh Organic Baby Spinach that definitely passes the Popeye test - and without 
the can, thankfully. It's loaded with nutrients, tastes great and is good for you any way you decide to enjoy 
it. In a salad with blue cheese and candied walnuts, in a hearty homemade soup, blended into a smoothie 
(use a powerful blender), or sautéed with a touch of olive oil and garlic, our Organic Baby Spinach will not 
disappoint. It's pre-washed and ready to eat, making it an effortless choice to include in your meal planning. 
Now that's super.

"As with the word ""quinoa,"" the word ""jicama"" is sometimes mispronounced. It's not kwin-Oh-ah, it's keen-
WAH. Likewise, it's not juh-KAI-ma, it's HICK-a-muh. Now, that we've got that out of the way¿

Also called the ""yam bean,"" (much easier to pronounce), jicama is native to Central and South America. It was 
originally cultivated by all major Mesoamerican civilizations. This root vegetable is shaped like an overgrown 
flat onion. It has papery, brown skin, which hides beneath it, crisp, white flesh. 

The Jicama's bulky size and odd shape make preparing it a cumbersome ordeal. This got us thinking: What if 
we took care of the painful prep stage for you? We presumed that if we did, more people would become eager fans 
of this refreshing, underutilized vegetable. So, we did. We peeled the skin and cut the flesh into ready-to-serve 
sticks. 

The mild, sweet-starchy flavor of jicama (sometimes described as a mix between pear flesh and potato flesh) 
makes the perfect blank canvas for dips-especially shaped like sticks, as these are. The wonderful crunch 
makes a great addition to fresh salsas and salads-just chop our sticks into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Jicama also 
works well cooked into stir-frys and soups. 

We're offering each 9.5-ounce container of Jicama Sticks for just $2.69, every day. (""Sticks"" is pronounced STIX, 
just in case you were wondering.)

Growing area: 
Our Tri-Color Bell Peppers are grown in Mexico in 
certified organic greenhouses.

Product Info: 
Greenhouse-grown bell peppers are large, and are a blocky bell shape. They are 
typically between 7-9 ounces in weight. All sweet bell peppers grown in greenhouses 
reach a mature size green, and then ripen to red, yellow or orange depending on the 
variety.

Taste:
Refreshingly crunchy and sweet, with slight differences between the colors. 

Uses:
Any color of bell peppers is perfect for eating fresh on its own, or added to salads or 
veggie trays with dip. Cooked, they are excellent stuffed, grilled on the BBQ, or lightly 
fried in Tempura batter.

"Cruciferous vegetables from the family Brassicaceae of the species oleracea have become increasingly 
popular with our customers. In plain English, we're talking about Kale, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli, Green 
Cabbage & Red Cabbage. 

Individually, these plants possess plentiful nutrients and character. When chopped together, however, they 
present colorful texture, crunch and plenty of culinary potential. Tossed raw, they make a mighty salad. 
Quickly sautéed, steamed, roasted or creamed, they become a striking side. We've also discovered that 
somewhere in between-tossed raw with hot dressing-makes them equally remarkable. While they will 
wilt slightly, they retain their signature crunch and incredible colors. We like them with a warm mixture of 
our Fat Free Sesame Vinaigrette and Toasted Sesame Oil-it brings out the inherently nutty flavors of these 
rich greens.

Cruciferous Crunch Collection of Chopped Kale, Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli and Green Cabbage & 
red Cabbage is a true Trader Joe's exclusive, which of course means the value is second to none. We're

"Originally cultivated in Japan in the 1970s, the first Sumo Citrus® was bred by growers who sought to combine 
the easy-peel nature of a satsuma, the considerable size of a standard orange, and the enticing sweetness of a 
mandarin all into one seriously scrumptious super-fruit. In the years since, the dekopon-as it's known in its 
home country-has become a global sensation, beloved for its sweet, almost candy-like flavor, its charmingly 
craggy skin, and its signature, top knot-like bump.

The Sumos you'll find at Trader Joe's are grown in California's San Joaquin Valley, where the climate is ideal 
for producing these fabulously flavorful Citrus. On picking one up, you'll be struck by the bumpy texture of its 
soft, loose-fitting peel. Then, after removing the peel, you'll likely be struck by the ease with which its seedless 
segments come apart. Finally, upon the first bite, you'll most certainly be struck by its marvelous sweetness 
and profound juiciness. But remember-Sumo season only lasts through mid-spring, so pick up a bag soon!

"These potatoes are sweet! But then, you knew that from the name. We don't just mean they are sweet as in, ""re-
ally great,"" but we also mean that compared to a russet, they actually have a sweet flavor-which is probably why 
they are so often paired with brown sugar for holiday meals. (See the label on the bag for a Sweet Potato Casserole 
that's a wonderful example of this highlighted sweetness.)

These Sweet Potatoes are also Organic, grown in the U.S.A. in an environment free of artificial additives and 
chemicals. They look slightly elongated, coming to a point on each end. The skin is a light red color, and the 
flesh is mostly bright orange, dappled with white-almost as pretty to look at, as they are to taste! In addition to 
being naturally sweet, our Organic Sweet Potatoes also have a moist and starchy texture, making them ideal for 
a wide variety of cooking preparations¿

Scrub the skins clean and bake them in the oven at 425ºF for about 50 minutes. Or, peel them and toss whole 
Sweet Potatoes in oil with seasonings before roasting them in a 425ºF oven for about 30 minutes. You can also 
boil and mash them with butter and cream for the ultimate comfort food side. Or dice them and cook them up 
with other veggies in a high-heat skillet sauté. Options are endless!

We're offering this large bag of Organic Sweet Potatoes only for the holidays, so now is the time to get your 
sweet on-at a price that really couldn't be much sweeter: $4.99 for the five pound bag.

"An exotic delicacy iconic to izakaya (Japanese tapas/appetizers/bar food), Shishito Peppers have become a 
ubiquitous and fashionable finger food of late. Here's why: Shishito Peppers are enormously delicious and a 
bit daring, couldn't be simpler to prepare, are famously finger-friendly, and make perfect appetizers.

Native to Japan (perhaps via Portugal, some speculate), the slender, green peppers have delicate skin and a 
slightly pleated surface that makes for a fresh crunch raw or a tender bite cooked. They have a whisper of 
grassy and peppery flavor, with a faint note of citrus. And-here's the kicker-some (approximately one in ten) 
have a real kick! So popping peppers is a bit roulette-y: mild, mild, mild, POW!... The hit of heat and suspense 
are addicting.

Minimal prep is the key to highlighting their bright flavor. Simply heat oil (olive or sesame) in a heavy skillet 
over medium-high heat, and cook the peppers, turning occasionally, until they begin to blister on all sides. 
Sprinkle with a bit of sea salt-they are ready to enjoy! They are also wonderful grilled or deep fried, and 
partnered with a Soyaki-style sauce or Sriracha cream for dipping. They are ideal appetizers. They can also be 
tossed on top of pizzas or served alongside steaks. We've even seen them served as a cocktail garnish.  

Is it possible to propel the popularity of these peppers further? We think our price of $1.99-$2.29 for each six-
ounce package of Trader Joe's Shishito Peppers will prove so.

"Did you know that we Americans consume more carrots than any other people in the world?  It's true.  On 
average, each of us consumes 11.5 pounds of these robust root veggies a year.  Can you even imagine 
how those numbers would increase if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors 
of the rainbow?  We're on a mission to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe's and the 
Organic Carrots of Many Colors.

A little history¿ until a few hundred years ago, carrots were most common in myriad colors.  The Dutch 
combined a yellow carrot with a red one and came up with orange, their national color.  These new carrots 
took hold and became the standard by which other carrots are judged. These days, the colorful originals 
are making a comeback, and while we're big fans of orange carrots, we also have a strong affinity for the 
Organic Carrots of Many Colors.  Every two pound bag is filled with a random assortment of yellow, 
cream/white, red, and of course orange carrots.  They all taste like carrots - no surprise there - but their 
color really pops on a plate.

Slice these vibrant taproots into spears, present them on a tray, and serve them with your favorite dip - we 
humbly recommend our Onion Dip Mix as the dip for the job.  Or toss them with olive oil, salt & pepper 
and roast them in a 400º oven for about 20 minutes - their hues will subdue when cooked, but their naturally 
sweet flavor will really shine and complement your entrée.  We're selling each two pound bag for $1.99, a 
price that will complement your holiday season budget.",51475,,2 Lb,,Organic Carrots of Many Colors,1.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/organic-carrots-of-many-colors-051475,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Organic Carrots of Many Colors"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":8,""name"":""Food"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":113,""name"":""Fresh Fruits & Veggies"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":119,""name"":""Veggies"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Organic Carrots of Many Colors\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20702/51475.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":2,""sales_uom_description"":""Lb"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":1.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Midday Snacks""],""item_characteristics"":[""Organic""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"
"No mere garnish, and not exactly the same thing as scallions, Green Onions can be used to flavor all kinds 
of things. Let's start in the middle, with the scallion thing. Green Onions do in fact look like scallions to the 
untrained eye (e.g., our eyes until we learned this), except scallions haven't developed a bulb at all. Green 
Onions have. It's a subtle difference, but a difference nonetheless. 

Both scallions and Green Onions are white onions, harvested quite young, that feature long, straight, edible, 
green leaves and mild onion flavor. That mild onion flavor complements so many different foods. Add chopped 
green onions - leaves and bulbs together - to soups, stews, and sauces. Blend them into burgers and meatloaf. 
Or lightly salt them, char on your grill, and serve with fresh lime wedges and a dash of Chile Lime Seasoning - 
this way, they make excellent partners to steak, carne asada, grilled chicken, or grilled salmon. 

Of course, you can use Trader Joe's Green Onions as garnish. Just remember they're the kind of garnish you 
actually want to eat.

often.

"Whoever gave Sugar Snap Peas their name was really onto something. What better way could there be to 
describe the sweet, satisfying pop of flavor that these pods provide? Trader Joe's Sugar Snap Peas, in particular, 
have an altogether pleasing crispness to them, making them a delectable textural element when added to 
salads, stir fries, or seafood pastas. They're even excellent when raw, as part of an elaborate crudités spread or 
even just idle snacking with some Buttermilk Ranch Dressing [sku 74462] for dipping. 

Botanically speaking, Sugar Snap Peas are a cross between English peas and snow peas, which explains their 
best-of-both-worlds combo of crisp texture and delicately sweet flavor. In need of quick side dish? Sugar Snap 
Peas are ready just like that. Give them a brief sauté with some olive oil and sliced garlic, or even just microwave 
them in the bag they came in for two minutes or so. Easy! You'll find them with our other refrigerated produce-
we recommend that you refrigerate them at home, too, so they'll retain their fresh, toothsome texture.

"Kits are king. They contain everything you need to get something done. Sewing kit? Mend a sweater. Shaving kit? 
Shave your face. First Aid kit? Fix the cut you got from shaving your face. What about a Salad kit? How about: 
Eat a salad.

We call our Broccoli & Kale Slaw a Complete Kit, because it has everything you'll need to make a fresh, cru-
ciferous salad. We've done the hard work for you, shredding broccoli stalks, kale and radicchio to create the 
crunchy slaw base. Our Kit also includes sweetened dried red sour cherries and blueberries for some sweet and 
chewy contrast. Roasted sunflower seeds and roasted slivered almonds add a nutty crunch. The final touch is our 
Sweet & Creamy Slaw Dressing that makes the Kit-and your salad-complete.

Each part-the dressing, the nuts, and the fruit-is packaged separately inside the larger bag so you have con-
trol as you put it all together. Divide it into smaller portions for several side salads to compliment your grilled 
burgers or BBQ'd ribs. Or add chicken or fish and turn this Broccoli & Kale Slaw Kit into an entrée for three.

You get the whole 11-ounce cruciferous 'kit and caboodle' (minus the caboodle) for $2.49 on the West Coast,

"Every year-and-a-half, a pineapple is born. Sounds dramatic, but that's really how long it takes for an Ananas 
comosus plant to grow this spiky, juicy, yellow-fleshed fruit (which is technically 100 -200 fused ""fruitlets""). But 
you know what they say: all good things take time. And pineapples are most certainly good things. 

Finding the perfect pineapple can be somewhat of a treasure hunt, but at Trader Joe's, you'll strike gold every 
time. Grown for us in Costa Rica, our Pineapples are harvested at the peak of ripeness, when the golden fruit 
is heavy with bright, sweet-tart juice. To really unlock the Pineapple's potential, peel it, core it, and slice it into 
rounds, spears or chunks. Then serve those slices alone, in a fruit salad, in a smoothie, in a cocktail, blended 
with yogurt, etc. Pineapple also happens to be one of those fruits that's delicious fresh and cooked, so don't be 
afraid to grill or broil those slices. Or to add them to a pizza-if that's what floats your boat, never mind the 
naysayers! 

We're selling large, whole Pineapples for $2.99 each. You'll find these good-sized, golden-hued beauties in our 
fresh produce section.",59817,,1 Each,,Pineapple,2.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/pineapple-059817,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Pineapple"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":8,""name"":""Food"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":113,""name"":""Fresh Fruits & Veggies"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":116,""name"":""Fruits"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Pineapple\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/59817.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":1,""sales_uom_description"":""Each"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":2.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Brunch All Day"",""Midday Snacks""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"Slaw is simple-but it's not simple to prepare. Whether you choose to chop, grate, or shred your cabbage, a lot 
of effort is required. That's why we're introducing Trader Joe's Organic Shredded Green & Red Cabbage with 
Orange Carrots-your simple slaw starter kit. 

It's a fresh mix of Green Cabbage, Red Cabbage, and Orange Carrots-all three certified Organic. They're also 
triple washed, which means you can also take ""washing"" off the list of things you'll have to do to have some slaw. 
This bag is ready shreddy to top tacos, supplement salads, and fortify your favorite stews and soups. 

For a super quick, slaw side salad, whisk together 1/4 cup of Carolina Gold BBQ Sauce [sku 51438], 1/4 cup TJ's 
Organic Mayonnaise [sku 60932], and 2 TBSP TJ's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar [sku 24472]-then toss with the 
entire bag of our Organic Shredded Cabbage and Carrots. (Recipe on the package.) You can even quick-pickle 
these Shredded veggies for a fast and fresh Curtido (that's Mexican slaw). Just make a brine by dissolving 3 Tbsp. 
apple cider vinegar, 2 tsp. sugar, and 1 tsp. kosher salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Toss with TJ's Organic 
Shredded Green & Red Cabbage with Orange Carrots and refrigerate at least one hour before serving. (If 
you're up for a little chopping, add white onion and/or jalapeno as desired.)

We're selling each nine ounce bag of Organic Shredded Green & Red Cabbage with Orange Carrots for $1.99. 
Find it in our refrigerated produce case.

Growing area:  Oxnard CA, Central CA, Baja CA, Mexico area. 
 
Product Info: Just 8 strawberries give you 140% of the Vitamin C you need each 
day. One of the major antioxidant vitamins, Vitamin C may protect against 
immune deficiencies, heart disease, cancer, inflammation, macular degeneration 
and aging of the skin. While strawberries lead the pack, blackberries, raspberries 
and blueberries are also all good sources of Vitamin C. 

 
Uses: Strawberries can be used in a variety of salads, appetizers, snacks, and 
beverages.  Try slicing off the top layer of brie and layer sliced strawberries, 
slivered almond, and a drizzle of honey and serve with warm bread.  Combine 
arugula with sliced strawberries, crumbled feta, pistachios, and finish with lemony 
vinaigrette.     

 
Handling/ Storage:  Strawberries should be stored between 32°F and 36°F and 
kept at 90 to 95% humidity.  The fruit should not be washed until it will be used.

About the Grower:  Our growers have been in business for over 35 years.  They are 
located in the #1 Sweet Potato producing counties in the US!   

Growing area:  Nashville, North Carolina.  The growing area is a 120-mile radius which 
includes Nash, Edgecombe, Johnston, Wake and Wilson counties. 

Product Info: The sweet, orange-colored root vegetable that is often thought of as a 
yam in the United States is actually a sweet potato. Yams purchased in the United 
States are almost always sweet potatoes.  Look for sweet potatoes that are firm and do 
not have bruises, soft spots or cracks.  Store in a cool dry place and do not refrigerate, 
as cold temperatures alter the flavor and shorten the shelf life of the yam. 

Taste:  Sweet and wholesome, with a rich nutty flavor. 

Uses: Sweet Potatoes are an extremely versatile vegetable.  They can be baked, 
roasted, fried, grilled, boiled, mashed or grated.  Make Sweet Potato biscuits, stuffing, 
soup, pie, casserole.  Or you can sweeten them by baking and adding a little butter or 
maple syrup, and topping them off with some brown sugar! 

Nutritional Benefits: Some refer to Sweet Potatoes as a super food because of their 
nutritional value.  They are very low in Saturated Fat, Cholesterol and Sodium, and an 
excellent source of Potassium, Fiber, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin C.

"If an apple a day keeps the doctor away (sorry, doctors), imagine what an Opal could do! Imagine it, a bright 
yellow gem of an apple, grown in eastern Washington, in fertile farmland near the crystal clear waters of the 
Snake River. A cross between Golden Delicious and Topaz apples, Opal Apples first appeared in 1999, but 
it wasn't until 2010 that they made their first appearance in the United States. Even now, years later, supply 
of these sunshine-yellow apples is so limited that Trader Joe's is one of the few retailers in the entire country 
where you will find them.

What's so special about these pommes?  They're enticingly sweet, pack serious crunch, and perhaps most 
miraculously, they are naturally resistant to browning when cut. What that means for you is that you can cut 
them up and serve them in a salad - no browning. You can slice them and add them to a lunchbox - no brown-
ing. You can present wedges on a cheese tray - no browning. This makes them almost as appealing when cut as 
they are when left whole. Almost.

We're selling conventionally grown Opal Apples for $1.19 each in our East Coast, Midwest, and Southeast 
store locations.  In our Texas and West Coast stores, we're selling Organic Opal Apples for $1.29 each.  Both 
are shining values ripe for the picking.",52688,,1 Each,,APPLE EACH OPAL,1.19,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/apple-each-opal-052688,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""APPLE EACH OPAL"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":8,""name"":""Food"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":113,""name"":""Fresh Fruits & Veggies"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":116,""name"":""Fruits"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Opal Apples\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m20701/52688.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":1,""sales_uom_description"":""Each"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":1.19,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Backpack Ready"",""Cheese Board"",""Midday Snacks""],""item_characteristics"":null,""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"When it comes time to cook, it's easy to get so wrapped up in the entrée or protein portion of the meal that you 
forget to include some greens on the plate. That's precisely why we like to keep one of our pre-chopped, ready-
to-cook vegetable blends on hand, like our new Trader Joe's Ready Veggies. Made with a medley of broccoli 
florets, Brussels sprouts, red cabbage, kale, carrots, and snow pea pods, these Veggies are Ready and raring to 
add a pop of flavor and variety of textures to any meal-all it takes is a few minutes in the skillet, wok, oven, 
or even microwave.

Equally able in last-minute dinner or pre-planned meal prep situations, these Ready Veggies are almost 
endlessly versatile. They can be enjoyed as simply as you'd like, sautéed in olive oil with just a bit of salt and 
pepper, or mixed in with all manner of seasonings and sauces. To add delightfully fresh flavor, tender texture, 
hearty nutrition, and a nice, multi-hued visual appeal to all kinds of dishes, these Veggies are at the Ready!

"People who love kale, love it for its earthy, green flavor and tender-chewy texture. They also love it for the variety 
of vitamins and minerals it supplies. But not all people love the fibrous stems that are often present, even in pre-
cut, packaged kale. Those woody stems stick out in an otherwise pleasantly crunchy green salad. They can also 
make your green smoothie significantly less than smooth. 

For these reasons, we sought out a kale supplier who could bring us the best of kale, minus the unpleasant 
stems. And we found it in Earth Greens® Organic Green Kale. Grown organically in California and Arizona, 
this Kale already comes out of the fields with fewer stems than typical mature kale. Then it's trimmed and 
coarsely chopped to eliminate any large stem pieces that may still  remain.

The result is an excellent eating experience-whether your kale is boiled in a soup, sautéed and served with 
pasta, blended in a smoothie, or eaten fresh in a green salad. (Incidentally, this Kale is also triple-washed and 
ready-to-use, which is another plus!)

Want to know another plus? We're selling each 10-ounce bag of Earth Green® Organic Green Kale for $2.69 on 
the West Coast and $3.49 on the East Coast.

chef to do? Trader Joe's has the answer with our 2lb bags of pre peeled and cut

"In 2008, a Swedish man named Linus consumed 31 Brussels sprouts in 60 seconds. Brussels sprouts are said to 
have first been cultivated around the 13th century in Belgium, specifically that country's capital, Brussels. But 
enough of the random brassica facts; let's Brussel up some useful information. 

Here's what you really need to know... Trader Joe's Brussels Sprouts are grown on the Central Coast of 
California and in the Skagit Valley of Washington. These mini-cabbage-like veggies have been harvested at 
their peak and our supplier has thoroughly washed them before putting them in the package. This means you 
can open up the bag, slice them in half, and transfer them directly to your roasting tray. Sprinkle them with 
olive oil, salt, and pepper, and put them in your 400°F oven until they turn golden brown (30-40 minutes). 
Of course, you can also boil these Brussels Sprouts, or sauté them. You can even cook them in your air fryer! 

Following Linus' lead, holiday gatherings tend to go heavy on the Brussels Sprouts. With that in mind, we're 
offering two-pound bags of Trader Joe's Brussels Sprouts during the holiday season for $3.99 each.

"About 25 years ago, our Top Banana (a.k.a. our CEO)-came across a long-time customer in our Sun City, 
Arizona store. After observing her pass on a pre-packaged bunch of bananas, he said, ""Excuse me, ma'am, but 
why aren't you buying those bananas?""

With the confidence of a customer who'd been around the banana-block, she shared with him that it would 
make her life much easier if we sold bananas individually, rather than in pre-packaged bunches. At her age, 
she explained, she wanted to take life one banana at a time. Well, we listened, and that's why Trader Joe's sells 
bananas one banana at a time. (You can hear him tell this story on the very first of episode of the Inside Trader 
Joe's Podcast.)

Decades later, Bananas are still a tremendous value and a customer favorite product, every day, in every store.   
If you're one of the few still on the fence, may we suggest an experiment to determine your preferred banana 
preparation? Use them according to the color of the peel! Yellow bananas with green tips are excellent when 
deep-fried or added to curries; full-yellow bananas are great for slicing into cereal, fruit salads, or banana splits; 
and yellow & brown-speckled bananas are ideal for mashing into banana bread, pudding, pancakes...

"A staple of salads, stir-fries, and curries the world over, baby corn's crisp texture and naturally sweet flavor 
make it a smart addition to all kinds of dishes - fresh baby corn, even more so. That's why we leapt at the 
opportunity to bring these six-ounce bags of fresh Trader Joe's Baby Corn to our produce section. Firm and 
crisp, but with a tender, snappy bite that lets you taste every teeny tiny kernel, these pre-washed and ready-to-
use Baby cobs are as versatile as they are adorable.

When we say all kinds of dishes can be improved with a bit of Baby Corn, we mean it: they can be roughly 
chopped and added to pasta primavera sauce, sautéed whole with savory, spicy noodles, or even given a light 
dusting of seasoned flour, fried, and served alongside a plate of barbecue. Their satisfying snap and delicate 
sweetness also make them a treat when served raw or as a dipping vehicle for your favorite creamy dip, too. Not 
to get too corny about it, but if you ask us, Trader Joe's Baby Corn has a bright future ahead of it.

"Did you know that we Americans consume more carrots than any other people in the world? On average, each 
of us consumes 11.5 pounds of these robust roots a year. Can you even imagine how those numbers would in-
crease if more people knew they could get carrots in (almost) all the colors of the rainbow? We're on a mission 
to make that happen, one carrot at a time, with Trader Joe's Les Petites Carrots of Many Colors.

A little history¿ until a few hundred years ago, carrots were most common in myriad colors. The Dutch com-
bined a yellow carrot with a red one and came up with orange, their national color. These new carrots took hold 
and became the standard by which other carrots are judged. These days, the colorful originals are making a 
comeback, and joining our full-size Organic Carrots of Many Colors [51475] this season are Les Petites Carrots 
of Many Colors, miniature versions of these colorful veggies. Every 16 ounce bag contains an assortment of 
colors, which will vary, including orange, yellow, white, purple, and red. The carrots themselves are about 4.75 
to 5.5 inches long, peeled, trimmed of foliage, and ready to use.  

Les Petites Carrots of Many Colors can go directly from their bag to a roasting pan with your holiday roast 
- turkey, beef, ham, or a veggie roast all play nicely with carrots, and the color of these really makes them pop 
when presented center of table. They make impressive crudités, served with dips, cheese, or charcuterie. Follow 
the recipe on the package for a thyme-tested presentation that you can prep in moments, and roast to readiness 
in about 20 minutes. We're selling each 16 ounce bag for $3.99.

"Sweet potatoes are light brown on the outside and orange on the inside, right? Not always, apparently. While 
every sweet-potato fry you encounter may indeed be vivid orange, we've gotten our hands on fields full of 
California- and North Carolina-grown Murasaki Sweet Potatoes that will challenge your perception of these 
terrific tubers.

Murasaki Sweet Potatoes are dark purple on the outside, and cream colored on the inside. Eye-catching! When 
you cut them open, your expectations simply don't match up with what you're seeing. They look like a russet, 
so they should taste like a russet, right? Nope. They're sweet, through and through, with just a hint of chestnut 
flavor. They're a bit fluffy (again, like a russet) and a little less moist than traditional sweet potatoes and yams, 
but if you're a sweet potato fan, these will definitely satisfy that craving. 

They are the same oblong-with-slightly-pointed-ends shape as more traditional varieties, if that helps you make 
the Murasaki leap. And they look so cool on a plate when they come out of the oven. Serve them with butter for 
a savory presentation, or go all the way sweet with a drizzle of maple syrup or honey.

We're selling Murasaki Sweet Potatoes in a three-pound bag for $3.99, while we can keep them in stock. You'll 
find them in our produce section.

"Honeycrisps were initially the offspring of an intentional marriage between the crispy Macoun apple and the 
sweet Honeygold. They were naturally crossbred in the later part of the last century by apple researchers at the 
University of Minnesota. Not falling very far from the tree, the Honeycrisp Apple has inherited the sweetness 
and crispness of its parents, each bite popping with an explosive crunch, giving way to very sweet, slightly 
tart flesh, which is also quite excellent for pie-making. And here is a fun fact: Honeycrisps contain larger cell 
structures than other apples, which is how it gets its crispy bite.

"You've likely been introduced to regular Thompson Seedless Grapes-but have you met their Sweet Baby 
siblings? If not, we're here to make the introduction! 

Sweet Baby Thompsons are essentially regular Thompsons that have grown on ungirdled grapevines. Girdling 
is the practice of carving out a thin ring of bark around the main vine trunk, effectively preventing water and 
nutrients from traveling back down the plant to the roots-while still allowing water to rise from the roots to 
the fruit, up through the center artery of the tree. 

Girdled vines cause grapes to retain more water, producing larger, less sweet fruit. But since Sweet Baby 
Thompsons grow as nature intended on uncut vines (probably why this variety is also called ""Natural Thompson

"First cultivated over 7,000 years ago in mainland China, soybeans have become an institution in their own 
right, providing a near-inexhaustible list of culinary, agricultural, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications 
in modern society. For our money, though, we treasure soybeans' simplest application, Edamame, most of all. 
With just a quick blanch in salted, boiling water, soybeans can become a suprisingly satisfying starter or snack, 
as evidenced by Trader Joe's Edamame with Sea Salt, a quick and convenient way to enjoy Edamame anytime.

Trader Joe's Edamame with Sea Salt comes pre-cooked and pre-seasoned with a fine sprinkling of sea salt, 
meaning they're ready to be eaten right out of the package - just squeeze the beans from the pod directly into 
your mouth and enjoy their light, nutty, salty and slightly sweet flavor. And since they're so simple, that means 
you can customize them any way you choose: add a bit of spice via the addition of hot sauce or wasabi, shake 
them up with some Everything But the Bagel Seasoning [sku 59137], or even add to the sweetness with some 
Turbinado Raw Cane Sugar [sku 97210]. Convenient, flexible, and at $2.99* for a nine-ounce pouch, Trader 
Joe's Edamame with Sea Salt may not represent everything the soybean can do, but it certainly shows how easy 
and delicious they can be. Look for it with our other refrigerated produce.

"Here's a little fruit to sweeten what remains of summer: Mini Sweet Peppers. Yes, peppers are considered fruit. 

These colorful gems, grown on North American farms, measure about 2.5 inches long and look like miniature 
bell peppers. They taste like them, too-but even sweeter and crunchier. This means they are ideal for adding 
to salads. 

And their firm, smooth skin stands up pretty well on the grill. Imagine roasted red, yellow and orange Mini 
Peppers spicing up your taco bar next to some grilled Premium Choice Angus Flank Steak [sku 56218]. Of 
course, by ""spicing up"" we mean with color, not heat. These seedless Peppers have been cultivated to be sweet, 
not hot-so everyone can enjoy them. 

Dip them in hummus, stuff them with cheese and bake them, or munch them right out of the bag. You'll find so 
many uses for these Mini Sweet Peppers, and you can have plenty on hand at our sweet price of $2.99 for each

"Among the best parts of summer, in our humble opinion, are stone fruits. Peaches and plums, nectarines and 
apricots, and all of the variations and combinations of these, can turn an ordinary day into a spectacular one. 
This is no exaggeration. We have this experience daily at this time of year. One of our favorite modern stone 
fruit families are the Plumcots¿. These plum-apricot hybrids come in for too-few weeks each summer, and 
leave us wanting more.

Throughout their short season, multiple varieties of Plumcots¿ will make an appearance on our shelves-each 
for a limited window of time. It's challenging to predict exactly which varieties we'll have on a given day-you 
might find red-skinned, red-fleshed Plumcots¿, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed Plumcots¿, or purple-skinned, 
orange-fleshed Plumcots¿. They're all a little different, but they're all bursting with vibrant flavors. If stone 
fruits are your thing, but you haven't yet discovered the Plumcots¿, now's your chance.

"If you're a fan of dates, you're going to love Trader Joe's Organic Pitted Medjool Dates. And, if you're not date-
fan, all the wonderful qualities of these just might make you a convert.

These Dates are grown organically in the Coachella Valley of Southern California. They are characteristic of 
the best Medjools, since we've only selected dates that are large in size (about two inches long) with very little 
loose skin. Each one is pitted by hand, ensuring that we deliver a snack-ready gem that is as beautiful to behold, 
as it is easy to eat. And since a pit accounts for 6% to 10% of a date's weight, you're getting more for your money 
with our Pitted Medjools.

We're selling each 12-ounce package of Organic Pitted Medjool Dates for $4.99*. They're available every day 
in our produce section, so you can never be late for these very important Dates!

"With velvety skin and sweet-tart, tender flesh, Fresh Apricots are like edible little orbs of Southern California-
grown sunshine. And who doesn't love edible little orbs of sunshine?! Their delicate texture makes them a 
dream when eaten fresh out of hand; when cooked, the Apricot's sugars are condensed into a sweet, perfumed 
syrup, ideal for drizzling on ice cream, shaking into cocktails, or baking into dainty thumbprint cookies. 

Unlike other stone fruits that can be enjoyed almost until the autumn leaves fall, Apricots are only around 
through the month of July. The good news? Until then, you can find one-pound packages of Fresh Apricots at 
your neighborhood Trader Joe's for the sunny price of $2.69 in the West & Texas and $2.99 in the East.
