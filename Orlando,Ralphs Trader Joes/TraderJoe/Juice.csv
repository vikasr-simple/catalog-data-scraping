"While its origins are often attributed to the Southern states, sweetened iced tea didn't take over rural porches 
and potlucks until ice was readily available in the South after the spread of electric iceboxes in the 1920's and 
1930's. We can thank the South, however, for the practice of stirring sugar into hot tea at the time it is brewed, 
and then chilling it, ensuring perfectly sweetened tea and no undissolved sugar granules hanging around at the 
bottom of your glass. Here to help you recreate the Southern sweet tea drinking experience at home (without 
all that stirring) is Trader Joe's Sweet Tea.

Kettle-brewed from whole black tea leaves and sweetened with cane sugar, Trader Joe's Sweet Tea is the ultimate 
in tea refreshment, not just during summertime, but anytime you're looking for a sweet, caffeinated kick in the 
palate. Its sweet, mellow flavor offers hints of toasted tea notes, while its warm caramel hue brilliantly sparkles 
in a tall tea tumbler. It's important to note: Southern tradition declares that Sweet Tea should be chilled, and 
served over ice-we suggest refrigerating the jug before serving so you're always ready for tea time. Enjoy it 
plain, garnished with fresh lemon slices and raspberries, or with lemonade for sweet take on an Arnold Palmer.

After you dust off the patio furniture and break out the lawn games, we suggest enjoying a glass of (chilled!) 
Trader Joe's Sweet Tea (over ice!) to cool you down after a day of fun in the sun -warm weather is upon us, 
after all. You'll find one-gallon jugs of Sweet Tea for $3.99, on the shelves with our other bottled beverages.",94280,,,,Sweet Tea Beverage,4.99,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png,,,,https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/sweet-tea-beverage-094280,,,,,,,,"{""item_title"":""Sweet Tea Beverage"",""category_hierarchy"":[{""id"":2,""name"":""Products"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":182,""name"":""Beverages"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""},{""id"":185,""name"":""Juices & More"",""__typename"":""CategoryTree""}],""primary_image"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png"",""primary_image_meta"":{""url"":""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png"",""metadata"":""{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""srcSet\"":[{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-640.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png/jcr:content/renditions/webp-1280.webp\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/webp\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.640.640\"",\""media\"":\""(max-width: 847px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""},{\""src\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280\"",\""media\"":\""(min-width: 848px)\"",\""type\"":\""image/png\""}],\""alt\"":\""Trader Joe's Sweet Tea\"",\""srcOriginal\"":\""/content/dam/trjo/products/m301/94280.png\""}"",""__typename"":""ImageWithMeta""},""sales_size"":128,""sales_uom_description"":""Fl Oz"",""price_range"":{""minimum_price"":{""final_price"":{""currency"":""USD"",""value"":4.99,""__typename"":""Money""},""__typename"":""ProductPrice""},""__typename"":""PriceRange""},""fun_tags"":[""Alfresco Dining"",""Heat Wave"",""Picnic""],""item_characteristics"":[""Kosher""],""__typename"":""SimpleProduct"",""dietaryTags"":"""",""product_variants"":[]}"

"We love all things coffee (see: our extensive coffee selection, The Great TJ's Coffee Boom of 2016, etc.), and La 
Colombe® Triple Draft Lattes fit in perfectly with our present offerings. Because this isn't just any Latte-it's 
three shots of cold-pressed, expertly roasted Nizza espresso blended with milk, sweetened with cane sugar, 
and infused with food grade nitrous oxide via a pin-sized valve in the bottom of the can. The result is an ex-
ceptionally silk, smooth, and rich latte complete with a frothy layer of foam, just like you'd find in a café. 

Enjoy a chilled Triple Draft Latte anytime you need a pick-me-up. Pour it over ice cream for an over-the-top 
affogato. Use it in a morning or pre-workout smoothie-we suggest blending the whole can with a frozen ba-
nana or combining it with 1 cup of Greek Style Nonfat Plain Yogurt [sku 69707], 1.5 cups of frozen Pitted Dark 
Sweet Cherries [sku 54044], and 1 ounce of 100% Red Tart Cherry Juice [sku 41747].

We're selling each 9-ounce La Colombe® Triple Draft Latte for $2.29, which is at least 50 cents less than 
you'll find it priced anywhere else. And if you compare that price against your current daily-iced-latte-habit 
spending, these canned pick-me-ups are an all out bargain. You'll find them chilling with our other refriger-
ated beverages, ready and waiting for you to grab one on the go.

"We've carried GT's Kombucha flavors at Trader Joe's since 2016. The latest addition brings the flavor of gratitude 
(if gratitude had a flavor) to our stores. More on this festive, fall flavor after a little refresher on GT's origins¿

In 1995, when GT Dave (that's right, ""Dave"" is his last name) was only 15, he started making kombucha in his 
family's kitchen. Today, GT's Kombucha is still made the same way: handcrafted in small batches from the 
original, proprietary S.C.O.B.Y. (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria & Yeast) he's been using for over two decades. 
The difference is, now there's a line of seventeen GT's Kombucha, distributed nationally. 

In addition to the Gingerade, Cayenneade, Trilogy (raspberry, lemon & ginger), & Watermelon WonderTM  

flavors we already carry, we're adding GT's Living in Gratitude to the lineup this fall.  (Beacuse fall...
Thanksgiving...gratitude...get it?) You'll be grateful to hear that Living in Gratitude is organic and raw 
(uncooked) and contains electrolytes, polyphenols, enyzmes, folic acid, and an array of B vitamins. And, since 
it's raw, it maintains all of its original probiotic value. It's a refreshing, effervescent fall drink that has that ""classic 
kombucha,""  apple-cider-vinegar  aroma and flavor-plus sweet, earthy carrot juice, turmeric, and plenty of fall 
spices (think cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, etc.).

We're selling each 16-fluid-ounce bottle of GT's Organic & Raw Living in Gratitude Kombucha for $2.99. 
Find it in our refrigerators with our other kombuchas & refrigerated juices.

"We don't typically offer that many brand-name products, so whenever we do, you can be certain that 
it's something special. That's certainly the category we'd place Tejava® Original Black Tea in. Its name is a 
portmanteau derived from the words ""tea"" (for the Camellia sinensis leaves used to make their tea) and ""Java"" 
(for the island from which they source said tea leaves), and at this point, we'd say it's practically synonymous 
with crisp, refreshing, and easy-drinking Black Tea, which is precisely why we're so excited to bring their one-
liter bottles of Original Black Tea back to our shelves.

Using only select Javanese tea leaves, Tejava®'s skilled brewers employ a unique microbrewing method to create 
this full-bodied Black Tea. In fact, each batch is made with only tea leaves and water-with nothing else added. 
We recommend keeping some bottles of Tejava® in your pantry or fridge: we find that they're always great for 
accompanying a lunch, sharing with friends when folks are over, or even just cracking open whenever you're 
particularly parched.

"You've probably heard of kombucha, and maybe you've heard of kefir... but have you heard of water kefir? If 
not, the shelves of Trader Joe's just might be the place to learn about it, courtesy of Agua de Kefir¿ Guava 
Paloma.  It comes to us from the folks at GT's®. whose work you may recognize from the fabulously flavorful 
kombuchas that we carry in our refrigerators. Inspired by the classic paloma cocktail, this flavorful, fermented 
drink combines the tart and tropical flavors of grapefruit juice and guava purée (along with a bit of habanero 
juice for a subtle hint of spice) with tangy (and decidedly dairy-free) water kefir that provides billions of 
probiotic bacteria in every single bottle.

Each bottle of Agua de Kefir¿ Guava Paloma starts with tiny kefir ""grains,"" which are actually grain-free, 
dairy-free granules made from a combination of lactic acid, bacteria, & yeast. When these ""grains"" are placed 
in reverse osmosis-filtered water along with organic cane sugar, they literally begin to eat the sugar & ferment. 
This fermentation yields carbon dioxide & more lactic acid, creating a stable environment for the cultures 
to grow and multiply. (Kombucha & ""regular"" kefir-the dairy kind-come from similar processes, but the 
kefir grains are activated in tea and milk, respectively, instead of in water.) And on top of all these probiotic 
properties, we're happy to report that Agua de Kefir¿ Guava Paloma is also remarkably refreshing. We 
recommend bringing a bottle along for a work lunch, for sipping during a hike, or as a pick-me-up after a 
strenuous yoga session.

"We certainly don't mean to cast any aspersions, but we've tried our fair share of other cold-pressed juices and 
juice shots out there, and, in the spirit of ""if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all,"" well... we'll

"Certain drinks indelibly evoke a specific time of year, like hot cocoa for the winter, apple cider for the fall, and 
ice-cold lemonade for the summer. With Trader Joe's Blueberry Elderflower Beverage, we wanted to create 
a drink that called to mind not just the feeling of springtime, but the very essence of it as well. We started 
with refreshing blueberry purée to provide a fruity, flavorful foundation, sweetened it with sugar, then added 
natural elderflower flavor for some enchantingly aromatic floral notes. This combo, along with a bit of lime 
juice for balancing acidity, give every sip the sensation of being in a field of flowers in full spring bloom.

Our Blueberry Elderflower Beverage is best served chilled or over ice, preferably while relaxing in late spring 
or early summer splendor. It makes an excellent accompaniment to a sunny weekend brunch, a picnic in the 
park, or a lazy day spent lounging by the pool. We also find that it makes a marvelous mixer for all kinds of 
spirits, and especially those with similarly botanical sensibilities, like our Art of the Still Gin [57854].

"Juice is fluid fruit. It's veritable veggies. It's all the goodness of fresh-picked produce, pulverized to a pulp and 
delivered up in a cup with nothing else added¿ at least, that's what juice should be. Trader Joe's Cold Pressed 
Green Juice is just as it should be.

Each 15.2-ounce, 100-calorie bottle contains an impressive one whole pound of spinach and seventeen kale 
leaves. To these nourishing greens, we add one large apple, a quarter of an English cucumber, one stalk of 
celery, one lemon, and two ""inches"" of a ginger root. Then, we ""juice"" them all all in a slow, hydraulic press 
for maximum liquid extraction. Once bottled, our juice goes through a cold, water-pressure method called 
HPP (High Pressure Processing), which guarantees a juice that's safe to drink, without reducing its nutritional 
benefits or fresh flavor.

Now, on to more pressing issues¿ How does it taste? Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Green Juice has a leafy-green 
aroma and a balanced, fresh-vegetable flavor. The smooth, bright-green liquid finishes with notes of ginger 
and tart lemon. A subtle sweetness comes from 11 grams of sugar-not one gram of which was added by us.

"Here's a 100% Juice blend that's sure to shake up your breakfast time routine. Trader Joe's Orange Peach 
Mango Juice is a sweet, tart, tangy, orange blend of orange, apple, pineapple, and white grape juices, with peach 
and mango purées. We named it Orange Peach Mango because those are the flavors that really predominate 
when you sip, slurp, or gulp it from the glass. This is a natural at the breakfast table. Add it to your smoothies, 
or blend it with ice for an Orange Peach Mango slushie. It's equally delightful in summertime cocktails. Swap 
the traditional orange juice with an equal measure of Orange Peach Mango and combine with Blanc de Blancs

"For those not too keen on heat, the word ""jalapeño"" might incite some combination of wariness and dread. Its 
bite lends flavor and heat to many Mexican dishes-and now to Trader Joe's Organic Jalapeño Limeade.

But fear not! The spiciness of this Jalapeño Limeade is mild enough for even the weariest spicy food consum-
ers-and will be pleasantly enjoyable for those who seek heat. Our Jalapeño Limeade might sound elaborate, 
but it's actually quite simple. It's made with water, organic lime juice that's not from concentrate, organic cane 
sugar, and organic jalapeño powder. The burst of tart lime pairs perfectly with a kick of jalapeño flavor for a 
mighty refreshing drink. 

Is there a better drink to enjoy during the height of summer-or to remind you of summer on those less-than-
summery days? Probably not. Serve this spicy Limeade served over ice with your choice of garnish: fresh lime, 
basil, mint, or cilantro are all excellent options. A splash of TJ's Distinqt Tequila Reposado [sku 80390] isn't a 
bad idea either¿

We're selling each 32-ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Organic Jalapeño Limeade for $2.29. You'll find it with our 
other shelf-stable beverages, waiting for you to enjoy its spicy sweetness.

"When creating our Trader Joe's Blueberry & Pomegranate Green Tea, our philosophy was to keep it simple. 
No added sugars, no artificial flavors or colors, and no calories too! Instead, we mixed freshly brewed green tea 
with a splash of actual fruit flavors, resulting in a well-balanced beverage brimming with natural phytonutrients. 
So, sit back, relax and enjoy the flavorful fusion of sweet blueberries and tart pomegranates in this delightfully 
and refreshing tea. In whatever season, TJ's Blueberry Pomegranate Tea can be served hot in a mug just like 
any other tea, or chilled over ice for a refreshing beverage. Remember the Tea is unsweetened, so enjoy as is, 
add a bit of honey to your cup o' tea, or a little Organic Cane Sugar [sku 27042] to your iced tea. 

You'll find each liter bottle of Trader Joe's Blueberry & Pomegranate Green Tea in our Shelf Stable Beverages 
section.

"Did you know? Both green and black tea are made with leaves that come from the same species of plant , Camellia 
sinensis. The difference in color and flavor between the two is due to the fact that black tea leaves undergo a 
withering (accelerated drying) and oxidation (curing in a climate-controlled room) process, whereas green tea 
leaves do not. Hence, green teas, like our Trader Joe's Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage, have a fresher, more 
floral, more delicately grassy flavor.

And it's exactly that flavor profile that makes our pre-brewed, ready-to-drink Unsweetened Green Tea Beverage 
so remarkably refreshing. Equally delicious whether it's served hot or chilled, it can be customized with slices 
of your favorite citrus, muddled with a sprig of mint, or even incorporated into an alluringly aromatic cocktail. 
We find that its fine, earthy notes are particularly well suited for serving alongside savory pastries, fresh cut 
melon, and seafood of all kinds. For an extra special treat, try mixing it with our Fresh Squeezed Lemonade [sku 
68172] in a 1:1 ratio and enjoying with a rice bowl topped with roasted salmon.

"In Old English, the word wassail literally translates to, ""Be you healthy!"" Substitute tasty for healthy, and you've 
got the perfect description for Trader Joe's Winter Wassail: A Spiced Holiday Libation. 

Though the word was originally used as a toast, it was also adopted as the name of a traditional Yuletide 
beverage-and that's where our Winter Wassail comes in. It packs quite a punch with its fragrant combination 
of fruit and spices. We started by blending sweet, fruitful apple and black currant juices with tart lemon juice. 
An infusion of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger and orange peel turns this from your average 
punch into a libation-a deliciously Spiced Holiday Libation, at that. (We feel compelled to clarify that there is 
no alcohol in this otherwise spirited drink.)

Heat our Holiday Libation over the stove with red wine, cinnamon sticks and orange peel for a delicious mulled 
wine drink (or nix the wine for those younger Spiced Holiday Libation fans). It's perfect paired with our 
European Cookie Collection [sku 37892], or as a warm accompaniment on all that door-to-door wassailing you'll 
do. (Yes, this word also means ""caroling."" We like Old English words that have multitudinous meanings.)

At $3.99 for a 64 ounce container, Trader Joe's Winter Wassail is a Holiday Libation for all Yuletide celebrations. 
Be you thirst-quenched this holiday season.

"Latte literally means ""milk,"" but with the explosion in popularity of espresso drinks over the last few decades, 
this word by itself now refers specifically to a coffee drink that includes espresso and steamed milk. Now, it 
stands to reason that a drink with latte in the title would include milk-however, reason does not always take 
into account the inexorable and eternal evolution of language. And as Trader Joe's Cold Brew Gingerbread 
Oat Latte shows, these days you can have a ""latte,"" while also avoiding milk altogether!

This creamy, decidedly dairy-free beverage starts with concentrated Cold Brew coffee and hydrolyzed oat 
flour-a.k.a. oat ""milk."" Aside from its non-dairy status, what also makes this particular Latte so special is the 
addition of Gingerbread flavor. To achieve this profile, we add ginger juice, cinnamon, and ground nutmeg, 
plus some cane sugar & brown sugar to sweeten the deal. It's a seasonal beverage that evokes all the best holiday 
memories, while also keeping you well-caffeinated-and milk-free!

it's not from concentrate, which means you won't find any weak, watered-down flavors here, folks. Instead, you 
get the bright, refreshing, and uninterrupted flavors of organic orange juice, organic pineapple juice, organic 
mango purée, and a splash of organic lemon juice. 

On its own, this balanced, bright-orange blend already offers up plenty of vitamin C. But to really take this juice 
To the Power of C, we've added acerola cherry powder, too, bringing the total Vitamin C count to 90mg per 
eight-fluid-ounce serving. That's 100% of the recommended daily value right there! Now, we freely acknowledge 
that there's no ""M.D"" after ""Trader Joe's"" (although ""Doctor Joe"" does have a ring to it, doesn't it?), but we'd say 
that's something you can feel good about. Literally and figuratively. Quick-To the Power of C!

"A long time ago in a land far, far away, chai-as we know and love it-was born. Okay, so we don't 
technically know when and where the first cup of chai was brewed-but we do know that sometime in the 
late 19th century, Great Britain was pulling out all the stops in an effort to increase black tea consumption 
wide and far. Lucky for us, in India, these promotional efforts birthed the ultimate East-meets-West 
beverage: black tea brewed according to Indian tradition (with plenty of aromatic spices) and served 
according to British tradition (with plenty of milk and sugar). Hi, chai. 

Now, over a hundred years later in your neighborhood store, another chai hero is born: Trader Joe's Vanilla 
Almond Spiced Chai. Like the chai of yesteryear, our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai strikes the perfect 
balance between comfortingly sweet and pleasantly spicy. All the usual suspects are present (cinnamon, 
nutmeg, cardamom, allspice, and black pepper), plus the addition of vanilla extract to tweak the flavor 
profile-but unlike the chai of yesteryear, this Chai is vegan and contains absolutely no dairy. Instead, the 
spices are softened by pea protein powder, almond paste, and coconut cream. And this beverage isn't just 
East-meets-West; boasting 16 grams of protein per bottle, it's also nutrition-meets-indulgence.

Down a bottle of Trader Joe's Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai before or after a workout. Mix two parts Chai 
with one part TJ's Cold Brew Concentrate [sku 50759] for a protein-packed eye-opener. At $2.99 per 16 
ounce bottle, Trader Joe's Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai is a steal no matter how you decide to enjoy it-so 
grab a bottle from your store's refrigerated case today

"Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Smoothie is for the coconut lover craving more than just coconut water. Our 
Smoothie scratches that itch precisely because it is coconut water, plus young coconut meat, blended into a 
creamy consistency.

Our supplier is sourcing the beloved Nam Hom coconut variety from the region of Rachaburi in western 
Thailand. Nam Hom means ""aromatic"" in Thai, which is appropriate since these tropical beauties are full of 
rich, sweet, coconut aroma and flavor. The coconut water is extracted, the coconut meat is hand scooped, and 
the combination is bottled, all on the same day as the coconut is harvested (in fact, within hours), ensuring the 
freshest flavor and maximum nutrients. 

We're selling each eight fluid-ounce Organic Coconut Smoothie for $1.99*. Find them in our refrigerators

"Rich, filling, and surprisingly delicious, protein smoothies have increasingly taken on a life of their own beyond 
the strictures of workout routines. In addition to providing loads of protein (and loads of energy), powerfully 
proteinous potables like our Vanilla Almond Spiced Chai Protein Smoothie [sku 57011] also provide loads of 
flavor, which got us thinking: what other sensations could we summon in smoothie form? After sampling a 
few new combinatins, we ended up picking the best of the bunch: say hello to Trader Joe's Banana & Almond 
Butter Protein Smoothie Beverage.

Made with a mix of coconut water, banana purée, almond butter, and pea protein, this Smoothie Beverage 
conjures the simple delight of a banana and almond butter sandwich (which we also heartily recommend) in 
the form of a smooth, creamy (but still decidedly non-dairy) beverage. Packed into each 16 fl. oz bottle are 14 
grams of protein, courtesy of the miracle of pea protein, giving you what you need to fuel your workout, hike, 
or even just your day at the office. Of course, if you're looking to truly kickstart your morning, you can also mix 
your Smoothie with a bit of Cold Brew Concentrate [sku 50759] to really get things going.

With all this protein, flavor, and almond-banana-coconut water synergy, you'd expect our Banana & Almond 
Butter Protein Smoothie Beverage to come with quite a price tag. But since this is Trader Joe's, each 16 fl. 
ounce bottle sells for the fittingly smooth price of $2.99. You'll find them with our other refrigerated drinks 
and fresh juices.

"As much as we love an ice-cold glass of lemonade, we don't always want all the sugar and calories that go 
along with it. That's why, for years, we carried a Low Calorie Pink Lemonade [sku 94628] that ticked all the 
boxes of a classic, thirst-quenching lemonade, but with a fraction of the calorie count. It was also made almost 
entirely from organic ingredients - everything but a sweetener derived from conventionally grown stevia, to 
be precise. Recently, however, our supplier was able to secure a source of organic stevia, which means we can 
now relaunch this long-adored libation as Trader Joe's Organic Low Calorie Pink Lemonade!

Made for us by the same supplier as our previous version, this Organic Low Calorie Pink Lemonade delivers 
all the same satisfyingly sweet and tart flavors as its predecessor, but now does so while being totally organic, 
too. Its carefully balanced ratio of organic cane sugar and sweetener extracted from organic stevia leaves makes 
it an ideal drink for enjoying on its own, over ice, but it also works wonders when mixed with sparkling water 
for an easy, lemony spritzer. And if you're looking for a mixer for a cocktail, this Organic Low Calorie Pink

"As much as we love an ice-cold glass of lemonade, we don't always want all the sugar and calories that go 
along with it. That's why, for years, we carried a Low Calorie Lemonade [sku 94244] that ticked all the boxes 
of a classic, thirst-quenching lemonade, but with a fraction of the calorie count. It was also made almost 
entirely from organic ingredients - everything but a sweetener derived from conventionally grown stevia, to 
be precise. Recently, however, our supplier was able to secure a source of organic stevia, which means we can 
now relaunch this long-adored libation as Trader Joe's Organic Low Calorie Lemonade!

Made for us by the same supplier as our previous version, this Organic Low Calorie Lemonade delivers all the 
same satisfyingly sweet and tart flavors as its predecessor, but now does so while being totally organic, too. Its 
carefully balanced ratio of organic cane sugar and sweetener extracted from organic stevia leaves makes it an 
ideal drink for enjoying on its own, over ice, but it also works wonders when mixed with sparkling water for an 
easy, lemony spritzer. And if you're looking for a mixer for a cocktail, this Organic Low Calorie Lemonade is 
as smart a choice as it is refreshingly sweet.

"Historically, many cultures have been crafting smoothies for centuries, but the United States didn't hop on the 
wagon until health food stores on the West Coast began churning them out with the onset of the commercial 
blender in the 1930s. We've carried a number of smoothies and cold-pressed juices over the years (we are a SoCal-
based grocery store, after all), but nothing quite like this before¿

Each 12 fluid-ounce bottle of Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Cucumber Avocado Smoothie contains an utterly 
refreshing, slightly tart, and impressively smooth blend of one cucumber (to establish a base flavor), one half of 
an avocado (to put the ""smooth"" in ""smoothie""), one half of a small mango, 1¿ cups of spinach, and the juice of 
one lime, four acerola cherries & three slices of ginger root. Instead of being traditionally (heat) pasteurized, the 
Smoothie goes through a cold, water-pressure method called High Pressure Processing (HPP), which guarantees 
a Smoothie that's safe to drink, without reducing its nutritional benefits or fresh, cucumber-forward flavor. And 
speaking of nutritional benefits, our Cucumber Avocado Smoothie boasts 4g of fiber, 4g of protein, and 280% of 
the recommended daily value of Vitamin C per bottle! Take that, trendy smoothie shop.

"Juice is fluid fruit. (Or veggies, depending upon its ingredients.) It's all the goodness of fresh-picked produce 
delivered up in a cup with nothing else added¿ at least, that's what juice should be. And that's exactly what 
you'll get in each bottle of  Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Pineapple Juice.

It takes one-and-a-half large, juicy, Guatamelan-grown pineapples to make one 12-fluid ounce bottle of Trader 
Joe's Cold Pressed Pineapple Juice. Right after they're harvested, we ""juice"" these golden pineapples in a slow 
hydraulic press, for maximum liquid extraction. Once bottled, our Juice goes through a cold, water-pressure 
method called HPP (High Pressure Processing). This process guarantees a juice that's safe to drink, without 
reducing its nutritional benefits or fresh flavor.

Now, on to more pressing issues¿  Just how does this stuff taste? Why, our sweet, smooth, and ever-so-slightly 
syrupy Trader Joe's Cold Pressed Pineapple Juice tastes just like fresh pineapples, of course! And with that out 
of the way, only one single question remains: With all the trendy cold pressed juice bars popping up, why choose 
to buy your juice from Trader Joe's? Because we're selling 12-fluid ounces of this 100%, cold-pressed juice for 
just $2.99-that's why! You'll be hard-pressed to find a similar Cold Pressed Pineapple Juice at such a value

"What is it about mangos that makes them such a natural partner to spicy flavors? Is it their ripe, tropical 
juiciness acting as a complementary counterbalance to the heat? Is there, perhaps, some inherent, underlying 
spiciness within the mango itself? Maybe it's just an example of mango magic. Whatever the case, we're all 
about it, which is precisely why we've introduced Trader Joe's Spicy Mango Lemonade to our refrigerators for 
the summer. It's sweet, tart, spicy, and refreshing all at once, making it an ideal beverage for anyone looking for 
a little something extra in their seasonal sipping. 

It serves especially well on a hot day, simply chilled in a glass filled with ice. But since there's a little more going 
on in this Lemonade, the opportunities to customize and build upon its flavor profile are nearly endless. You 
can dust the rim with a little salt and cayenne, garnish with herbs or slices of jalapeño, or even make a sweet, 
fiery cocktail by adding a shot of tequila or whiskey. Now that's mango magic

"It should come as no surprise that cucumbers and watermelons share the same heritage. Both have green skin, 
aqueous flesh, and an invigorating scent. It's a shame that with such strong family ties, they spend so little 
quality time together-health spa water coolers aside. Just like you'd expect, we've taken it upon ourselves to 
stage a family reunion¿ in a different kind of cooler. That's a Watermelon Cucumber Cooler, to be precise. 
This light and refreshing juice blend proves how good it is when relatives get along. 

It looks like pink lemonade, but there's nothing tart about it  - just juicy watermelon and cucumber flavor, 
partying together. We've added some organic sugar-but not too much-yielding a light and refreshing drink 
that's perfect for the onset of Spring. Fill a tall glass with ice cubes and treat yourself to a long pour. When eve-
ning rolls around, put your mixology chops to the test. However, it shouldn't be much of a challenge, since the 
flavors in this Cooler mix well with vodka, gin, rum, tequila¿ just about any spirit you might have on hand!

"Nothing says ""summer"" quite like an ice-cold glass of lemonade or limeade. (We're real lime-lovers these days, 
so for now, let's focus on the latter.) Sure, you can squeeze the stuff yourself-but it'll require a whole 'lotta 
limes, some brute strength, and the ability to tolerate a sticky mess. Or you can buy your Fresh Squeezed 
Limeade at Trader Joe's. 

Most store-bought limeades can only approximate the results you'd get at home, and they typically include added 
artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrup. They're also often made from lime juice concentrate. Trader Joe's 
Fresh Squeezed Limeade, on the other hand, is the closest thing to homemade you'll find. Our recipe includes 
only four ingredients: filtered water, granulated sugar, fresh, not-from-concentrate lime juice (accounting for 
20% of the recipe!), and a splash of lemon juice for extra brightness. Our supplier-a third-generation, family-
owned fresh juice producer-not only expertly grows, selects, and squeezes the citrus themselves; they also 
purposely don't pasteurize the juice, which allows the pure, sweet-tart Limeade flavor to shine through. Now, 
isn't that refreshing?

"Be it on a scorching hot day, a balmy afternoon brunch, or just any time you're in the mood for something 
sweet and tart, nothing's better than a cool, crisp lemonade. Unless, of course, you enhance the experience with 
a little touch of effervescence, as we do with Trader Joe's Sparkling Lemonade. This four-pack of impeccably-
portioned cans of brisk, bubbly Lemonade provides a one-two punch of refreshing, citrusy sweetness and 
satisfying fizz to create one eminently easy-drinking soda.

We recommend serving Trader Joe's Sparkling Lemonade ice cold, in a glass filled with crushed ice, or right 
from the can, straight out of the fridge. It's a great beverage for pool parties and barbecues, where its sweet-
tart profile pairs beautifully with burgers and other cookout fare, but also works wonders as an after-school 
or post-work pick-me-up. And that's before we get to its capabilities as a cocktail mixer - sparkling whiskey 
sour, anyone? Be sure to grab a four-pack of 8.45-fl. oz. cans of our summer-seasonal Trader Joe's Sparkling 
Lemonade while inventory lasts.

"When the weather turns sizzling hot, our thoughts turn to the cool, refreshing flavor of watermelon, time and 
time again. Supremely sweet and superlatively juicy, watermelon is one of those singularly refreshing flavors 
that we just can't get enough of during the summer months. Luckily, we've got Trader Joe's Cold Pressed 
Watermelon Juice and its pure, crisp, straight-from-the-melon flavor to keep us refreshed all season long. 

To make each 12 fluid ounce bottle of this Cold Pressed Watermelon Juice, our supplier squeezes a pound 
and a half of pure watermelon and one fitfh of a lemon in a slow, steady hydraulic press, allowing every drop 
of juice to be extracted from the fruit. The juice is then bottled and subjected to a process called High Pressure 
Processing (or HPP), which keeps it fresh, flavorful and safe to drink, all without the use of added preservatives. 
In fact, other than the watermelon and lemon juices, nothing is added to this drink. Everything you taste is 
pure, refreshing, delightfully sweet Cold Pressed Juice, perfect for drinking after a run on a scorching summer 
morning, or as part of a thirst-quenching cocktail on a warm summer evening.

For a limited time (the remainder of summer, more or less), you can find 12 fl. oz bottles of Trader Joe's Cold 
Pressed Watermelon Juice for $2.99*. Look for them in our refrigerators, with our other fresh juices.

"If summer were a drink, it would surely have to be lemonade. Sweet, refreshing, and delightfully tart, a cool, 
crisp glass of lemonade immediately evokes the very best aspects of the season, and like most juicy drinks, the 
more freshly squeezed, the better. Now, one could make it from scratch on their own, but who wants to spend 
their precious summer days sifting through seeds and pulp? That's why, every year, we offer Trader Joe's Fresh 
Squeezed Lemonade. It's made for us by a third-generation, family-owned grower and manufacturer of fresh-
squeezed juices, who provides it to us unpasteurized - a decision that makes all the difference in allowing that 
pure, sweet-tart, summer-sensation-summoning flavor to shine through. 

Made with only three ingredients (sugar, water, and lemon juice), our Fresh Squeezed Lemonade's refreshing 
simplicity allows for even further refreshment via customization. For instance, try muddling it with a bit of 
fresh mint or rosemary, mixing in your favorite fresh fruit, or finding your perfect ratio of Lemonade to tea.

"We tend to think of cow's milk as simply ""milk,"" but there's actually quite a few intermediary steps between 
milk being produced by a cow and it reaching your cereal bowl. In the U.S., it's typically pasteurized, for food 
safety, and homogenized, to make sure the cream doesn't separate in the carton. In recent years, the process of 
ultra-filtration has grown in popularity, too. Ultra-filtered milk is created by filtering the milk with a membrane 
so fine that it actually removes the lactose, as well as some of the other sugars that naturally occur in milk. It 
also creates a milk that's comparatively higher in protein and calcium, and even tastes a little creamier. 

Sounds amazing, right? We thought so too, which is why we decided to bring Trader Joe's Ultra-Filtered 
Reduced Fat Milk to our refrigerators. Aside from being ultra-smooth and ultra-creamy, this 2% milkfat 
Ultra-Filtered Milk is certified lactose free, and made using milk from cows not treated with rBST. While 
it's great for anytime drinking, the fact that each glass already contains 14 grams of protein makes it a great 
choice for making protein smoothies. Whether you're avoiding lactose, trying to increase your protein intake, 
or simply interested in a smoother, creamier glass of milk, Trader Joe's Ultra-Filtered Reduced Fat Milk has

"In the Philippines, two things are called ""carabao"": water buffalos and mangoes. We briefly (very briefly)
entertained the idea of bringing in 100% water buffalo juice-but quickly decided that mangoes made a better
choice. (We hear water buffalo juice can be watery.) Our panel of tasting experts and common sense would
suggest that we've made the right call...

Trader Joe's 100% Mango Juice from Carabao Mangoes is not from concentrate. This means it is pure Mango 
Juice, pressed from fresh, ripe mangoes, and pasteurized and canned on site in the Philippines. ""But mangoes 
are grown all over the world!"" you say, ""Why go all the way to the Philippines for simple Mango Juice?"" The 
answer-like this Juice-is simple: Only the Philippines grows the Carabao variety of mango, and Carabaos are 
recognized the world over for their especially smooth, exceptionally sweet, minimally-acidic flesh (and juice). 
The Juice is delightful on its own-we recommend serving it chilled-but it also makes a bright, summery 
addition to smoothies, cocktails, iced tea, and more.

"Great news: we've given classic carrot juice some extra character! (You have had your fingers crossed for that, 
now haven't you?) Turmeric has long been valued for its unique taste and versatility-we've seen it in every-
thing from soups to lattes to cakes as of late-and its notable presence in our new Organic Carrot Turmeric 
Juice Blend creates a distinct, enjoyable beverage that is sure to have everyone talking.

To concoct Trader Joe's Organic Carrot Turmeric Juice Blend-a mighty fine elixir if we've ever sipped one-
we take rich, naturally sweet organic carrot juice, blend it with organic turmeric powder and a bit of organic 
lemon juice, then add a bit of organic black pepper and organic chili pepper powder. Fear not, though-the 
pepper lends it just the right amount of spice to make it interesting, not set your mouth on fire. 

Have a glass of Organic Carrot Turmeric Juice Blend every morning with breakfast. Add some TJ's Lemon 
Sparkling Water [sku 34532] (and perhaps some vodka if you're in the mood¿) for an extra-refreshing fizz. Or 
get more creative and use it as a base in a smoothie or a wintery-y, root vegetable soup. 

We're selling each 32-ounce bottle of Organic Carrot Turmeric Juice Blend for $3.99, every day. You'll find in 
our beverage aisle.

"On a visit to a potential new juice supplier in the Dominican Republic, we saw a bowl of a gorgeous, cherry-like 
fruit sitting on our meeting table. It was explained that these were acerola cherries native to the DR and that 
just one of them contains over 100% of our daily recommended value of vitamin C. Immediately, we knew this 
had to become our next Juice Shot!

Each Trader Joe's Absolutely Acerola Juice Shot contains the cold-pressed juice of 12 acerola cherries. That's 
it! And just a single, two fluid-ounce serving (one bottle) contains 1010% of your daily recommend amount of 
vitamin C. (Just to be clear, we did not accidentally add an extra zero. It really is over 1000%!)

What's more, you can trust you're tasting the true, tart & fruity juice of the acerola since our supplier uses 
an HPP (High Pressure Process) to help maintain the safety of the juice and the quality of the flavor. Find 
Absolutely Acerola Juice Shots in our refrigerators alongside our Organic Mighty Turmeric Juice Shots [sku
