"Brie is one of those cheeses that especially excels when accompanied with something sweet-we're particularly 
partial to pairing it with apples and some manner of dessert spirit, ourselves. So, when we encountered this 
French Brie flavored with brandy made from apples, we positively leapt at the chance to bring it in for the 
holidays. Indeed, Trader Joe's French Triple Crème Brie with Calvados Apple Brandy is crafted for us by 
a famed French fromagier who directly infuses each wheel with Calvados (a renowned apple brandy from 
Normandy, France), so that every bite is both superlatively creamy and phenomenally fruity, with just a touch 
of cider-y tartness.

As such, we find Trader Joe's French Triple Crème Brie with Calvados to be an equally outstanding addition to 
an hors d'oeuvre plate or a dessert spread. (In either instance, we recommend letting it reach room temperature 
prior to serving, so that it reaches a magnificent level of meltiness when sliced and spread on a cracker or 
crostini). And for those who are really looking to step up their dessert game, try melting a bit over a slice of 
Apple Crumble Pie [sku 74908]. That's right. We went there.

"With aged, smoked, sliced, and even goat's milk-based Goudas at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, it's safe to 
say that we're quite nuts for Gouda-so nuts, in fact, that we mixed nuts right into Gouda with Walnuts! 

Our Dutch supplier starts with a traditional, young Gouda base. On its own, it's pleasantly mellow and smooth. 
Incorporate Walnut pieces, however, and it becomes a satisfying symphony of contrasting flavors and textures. 
Each bite is mild yet earthy, creamy yet crunchy, and undeniably delicious.

Gouda is quite the versatile cheese, and Gouda with Walnuts is no exception. Serve it on a cheese board 
featuring fresh apple slices and Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps [sku 51246], with a glass of Angeline Pinot Noir 
[sku 57521]. Or, sandwich slices of Gouda, Oven Roasted Turkey Breast [sku 81594], Organic Apricot 
Preserves [sku 75418], and arugula between slices of Ciabatta Demi-Baguette [sku 96399], then toast to

"Instantly recognizable from its vibrant, ruddy hue and sharp, Cheddar-like flavor, Trader Joe's Red Leicester 
Cheese comes to us from a farmer-owned cooperative that's been in the cheesemaking business for well over a 
hundred years. From their farms, located in this Cheese's namesake county of Leicestershire in England, they 
carefully craft, age, and shape each puck-sized wheel to ensure only the highest quality, most perfectly matured 
Leicester makes its way to our stores. After that, they coat each wheel in deep red wax, so that when you take 
it home, peeling it open to serve feels a bit like opening up a culinary gift to yourself.

With its signature rich, red-orange color (courtesy of annatto, a natural coloring derived from the seeds of the 
achiote tree) and delightfully nutty, savory, and delicately sweet flavor profile (courtesy of the expertise provided 
by our esteemed supplier), Trader Joe's Red Leicester truly stands out on any cheese board or charcuterie 
plate. It's also renowned within the greater cheese world for its marvelous meltability: we recommend trying it 
sliced on a burger, mixed into mashed potatoes, or shredded and served over hot scrambled eggs.

"When our product developers think of ways to flavor cheeses, it's usually a question of what ways we can 
complement the inherent quality a cheese already has. The sharpness of Cheddar, for example, lends itself 
extremely well to spicier notes. Creamy Goudas take on smoky and herby elements with aplomb. And for a 
tangy and tart goat's milk cheese? Something sweet, umami-rich, and irresistibly alliaceous will make it sing-
something like the combo found in Trader Joe's Caramelized Onion Goat's Milk Cheese, in fact.

Whether it's enjoyed on a cracker, a bit of crostini, or a well-toasted bagel, this Caramelized Onion Goat 
Cheese creates a synergistic symphony on the palate. It elevates cheese plates and charcuterie boards with its 
balance of sweet and savory. It uplifts burgers and sandwiches when used as a spread. And when baked with 
a bit of puff pastry and fresh fig, makes a truly unforgettable hors d'oeuvre. Just be sure to stop by the cheese 
section of your neighborhood Trader Joe's soon, because supplies are limited!

"England's highly esteemed Stilton® cheese has been made in the exact same way and in the exact same places 
for hundreds of years. It's so revered, in fact, that it's protected by the European Union with a PDO, or protected 
designation of origin, to ensure any cheese bearing the name lives up to its spectacular reputation-cheeses 
like Trader Joe's White Stilton® Cheese with Apple and Pear.

Produced for us in Leicestershire, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise, this White Stilton® is made 
only from locally pasteurized cow's milk, infused with the pleasant sweetness of freeze-dried Apple pieces 
and a hint of Pear. It's formed into a cylindrical shape, but is not pressed during its six-week aging period to 
help create an airy texture. The result is a sensationally light, slightly tangy cheese that offers pops of sweetness 
throughout to complement the savory nature and creamy-crumbly texture of the base.

White Stilton® Cheese with Apple and Pear is best enjoyed after a 30-minute rest at room temperature, so 
plan ahead before crumbling a handful over salads, soups, and pizzas. It also presents particularly well on a 
cheeseboard alongside walnuts, figs, and apple and pear slices. Or, spread it on crackers, drizzle them with 
honey, and pair them with Porto Morgado 10 Years Old Tawny Port [sku 71736] for a sweet and sophisticated 
dessert.

"Situated on the very tip of the westernmost peninsula in Marin County, CA, the idyllic rolling hills of Point 
Reyes host some of the finest dairy farms in the world. One such dairy farm, the Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese 
Company, has been family-owned and operated for over 50 years, crafting blues, Cheddars, mozzarellas, and, of 
course, their signature cheese, the Point Reyes Toma [sku 63690]. Italian for ""wheel of cheese made personally 
by the farmer"", Point Reyes' award-winning (and TJ's Spotlight Cheese alum) Toma has proven so popular, 
that Point Reyes has recently taken to offering variations on the Toma theme-including our newest Spotlight 
Cheese, the pleasantly peppery Point Reyes TomaRashi.

Each wheel is made with a spicy, umami-forward mélange of dried chilis, orange peel, powdered ginger, nigella 
seeds (also known in some parts as black caraway), and dried seaweed, mixed right in. Modeled after the 
traditional Japanese spice mix shichimi togarashi (hence TomaRashi), this bold and flavorful blend makes 
the ideal foil to the Toma's inherent butteriness and creamy, semi-firm texture. With every bite, your palate is 
treated to a savory, complex profile with an even, warming heat that's especially suited for enjoying as part of a 
charcuterie board, melting into a grilled cheese sandwich, or pairing with a crisp white wine or citrus-y cocktail.

"Things are heating up in the Trader Joe's cheese section this summer! Made for us by a renowned Wisconsin 
creamery that's known for their sharp, rich Cheddars, a trio of hot chili peppers is mixed into every batch of 
Trader Joe's Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar Cheese before the whole wheel is smoked over aromatic hickory. 
Together, the capsaicin-laden combo of jalapeño, habanero, and fiery hot Ghost Pepper, along with its subtly 
smoky tones give this newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese program a uniquely savory and delightfully 
(though not overwhelmingly) spicy flavor profile.

A treat for true heat-seekers and less experienced spice fans alike, our Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar can 
be enjoyed totally on its own, or as part of a larger cheese board or charcuterie spread, where it will add an 
elegant element of contrasting heat and smoke. We find that it's especially suited, however, for shredding and 
sprinkling over and into other savory dishes and snacks. Try it on a chili dog, rolled into a hearty breakfast 
burrito, or folding into a full-flavored quesadilla. Just be sure to seek out this Smoked Ghost Pepper Cheddar 
before it's too late, because supplies are limited. To paraphrase an old adage, the cheese that burns twice as hot 
lasts half as long on the shelf!

agree on-why, even its name makes it sound like a fundamentally friendly fellow. One of our favorite aspects 
of a good Monterey Jack is how well it serves as a canvas to other ¿ avors-Pepper Jack [sku 73328] being one 
of its most popular permutations. Which lead us to think: what other savory sensations might Monterey Jack 
mingle well with? ¿ at, in turn, lead to some epicurean experimentation, which happily lead to Trader Joe's 
Sliced Black Tru¿  e Monterey Jack Cheese.

It's cra¿ ed for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, who infuses their Jack with bits of black summer 
tru¿  e before cutting it into sandwich-ready slices. Every bite is savory and satisfying, with a toothsome texture 
and a distinct touch of tru¿  e-y, umami oomph that makes it especially great for grilled cheeses, patty melts, 
and quesadillas. Try it on a burger, melted into an omelet, or, if you'd like a little complementary savory-sweet 
situation, alongisde some Fresh Cut Cantaloupe Chunks [sku 95266].

"We have no guilt in admitting a freshly opened bag of Trader Joe's Organic Shredded Mozzarella Cheese 
is a tempting shortcut to eschew any skinned knuckles and wasted time grating your own mozzarella. While 
taking the time to make it yourself has its place, we really try our best to deliver you the freshest, softest, and 
stretchiest Organic Shredded Mozzarella Cheese we can find!

Whether oozing off of a slice of pizza or layered in a pan of lasagna, Trader Joe's Organic Shredded Mozzarella
Cheese is ready to include in many dishes for a melted, stringy, and flavorful cheese addition. Our mozzarella
fior di latte, the Italian terminology for cow's milk mozzarella, is made with pasteurized organic part-skim 
milk, some cheese cultures and vegetable based rennet. Pasta filata, again, an Italian term, but this time for the 
mozz making process, is as simple as starting with fresh whey and cheese cultures, adding the vegetable rennet, 
and then heating in water to form a stringy and elastic cheese that can be kneaded and then shredded; ready for 
you to sprinkle and melt on whatever you'd like! You'll find each 8-ounce bag of Organic Shredded Mozzarella 
in our refrigerated, cheese section.

"Maybe you enjoy Trader Joe's String Cheese [sku 30337], or our Organic Light String Cheese [sku 92280]. These 
individual sticks of milky mozzarella are a great option when you want a little protein boost, or are craving 
a bit of cheese. Now we've added another option to our family of handy cheese snacks: Trader Joe's Fresh 
Mozzarella Cheese Snackers.

These bite-size balls of fresh mozzarella are made from milk that's freshly collected in the Treasure and Magic 
Valleys of southern Idaho; and it comes from cows that are not treated with rBST hormones. Making the 
Mozzarella involves microbial enzymes, which should please any cheese-loving vegetarians. The soft, yet 
reslient texture of the final product-with its creamy, milky flavor-should please anyone who loves good 
cheese!

Each eight-ounce, resealable package contains eight, smaller, 70-calorie snack pouches that are ideally portioned 
for whenever that cheese craving creeps up. Enjoy the Fresh Mozzarella by itself and benefit from five grams 
of protein per pouch. Of course, you can always pair your pouch with other healthy snackables, such as Mini 
Pearl Grape Tomatoes [sku 26144] and Organic Cut and Peeled Carrots [su 36679]!

discover that the entire cheese making process - from fresh-from-the-farm milk (from cows raised without 
the use of rBST) to packed-and-ready-to-ship cheese - takes only about three hours, you will be so filled with 
love that you're sure to find yourself with a craving for this mild, mozzarella-style cheese that's portable and 
pulls apart with such ease. 

We think String Cheese is an excellent snack for anyone, really, whether you're a kid or just a kid at heart - for

"Nearly everyone who's experienced it enjoys that moment when the Burrata ball is sliced open to reveal 
luscious cream loaded with shreds of fresh mozzarella. But not everyone knows that this coveted Burrata 
Filling is actually an Italian cheese on its own, known as Stracciatella. For a limited time, you can now buy 
Trader Joe's Stracciatella Burrata Filling to bring cheesy, Italian flair to your summer entrées and side dishes.

Our Stracciatella is richly textured and mildly sweet, which makes it ideal for pairing with acidic flavors, like

[sku 75006]. Drop dollops of Burrata Filling on your hot-from-the-oven pizza, or plate of pasta primavera. 
Of course, our Stracciatella also makes a great addition to a crisp green salad, drizzled with balsamic vinegar. 
And if you simply want to enjoy the unique character of this cheese like the Italians do, try eating it straight out 
of a bowl with a spoon. For a limited time, you'll find tubs of Trader Joe's Stracciatella Burrata Filling in our 
refrigerators among our multiple, molto bene, mozzarella varieties.

"Every now and then, we introduce a product that attains a kind of instantaneous iconic status. Our Everything 
But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 59137] definitely falls into that category. Since its debut back in 
2017, it has remained perennially popular, and it's easy to see why: it turns out that garlic, onion, poppy, 
sesame, and sea salt synergize with a whole lot more than just bagels. Take, for instance, this new addition to 
our cheese section, Trader Joe's Everything But the Bagel Cheddar Cheese. It's crafted just for us by an expert 
cheesemaker, who infuses each wheel with the very same seasoning we sell on our shelves, so that each bite is 
rich with the maximalist mix of aromatic alliums, crunchy seeds, and savory spice you know and love.

In addition to making an excellent cheese to simply snack upon, we find that these pops of flavor and texture 
also make this bold and tangy Cheddar a great choice for a grilled cheese or macaroni bake, or slicing and 
serving atop a nice burger on a Brioche Bun [sku 61752]. Try it on your next cheese board or charcuterie spread 
the next time you have company over. And if you feel like bringing everything full circle, try melting a slice 
over a toasted bagel with a fried egg and bacon for an unbeatable breakfast sandwich.

"Individually, cheese made from goat's milk and cheese made from sheep's milk are fantastic: goat's milk 
cheese is typically creamy and elegant, with a soft texture and dry aftertaste, while sheep's milk cheese is often 
savory and firm, with a smooth texture and a light nuttiness. But when you put them together, as the talented 
hands behind Mobay® Cheese have done, that's something else entirely. Crafted for us by the certified Master 
Cheesemakers at a renowned Wisconsin creamery, our latest Spotlight Cheese is made by stacking together 
wheels of flavorful goat's milk cheese and sheep's milk cheese, with just a thin layer of faintly smoky grapevine 
ash between them.

Mobay® is a tantalizingly delicious tandem-a showcase for the best aspects of goat's milk cheese and sheep's 
milk cheese, as well as an opportunity to explore how exponentially delicious they taste when eaten together. 
Best enjoyed in situations where you can truly sit and savor their complex, creamy flavors, try serving Mobay® 
on crackers or crostini, with plenty of dried and fresh fruit to pair it with. Be sure to try both halves on their 
own and together-you don't want to miss out on experiencing the complementary flavor that the grapevine 
ash brings. And unless you want to miss out on Mobay® entirely, be sure to grab it quick - supplies are limited!

"The label for Ivy's Reserve Somerset Red describes it as ""nutty, mellow & moreish,"" the latter being a British term 
that means, ""having a very pleasant taste and making you want to eat more."" That's an enticing endorsement 
and one that's proven to be accurate upon your very first taste of this Cheese.

Crafted in the style of a Red Leicester, Ivy's Red is a special edition among Wyke Farm's variety of Cheddars. 
It definitely stands out for its burnt-orange color and nutty & fruity notes, which are delivered with a firm 
texture that is rich, creamy, a bit tangy, and... moreish. All this complexity develops over 12 months of aging, 
and benefits from the skills of award-winning cheesemakers.

By the way, it's worth noting that Wyke Farm's entire Cheddar-making line is carbon-neutral, meaning that 
they've gone to great lengths to create a process that is sustainable, utilizing natural resources such as solar & 
biogas to power the entire operation. 

Pick up a seven-ounce piece of Ivy's Reserve Somerset Red while you can-you're definitely going to want to 
eat more of Trader Joe's April 2024 Spotlight Cheese!

"Just in time to help celebrate St. Patrick's Day, our March Spotlight Cheese showcases two specialties of Irish 
craftsmanship at once: sharp, savory Cheddar, and rich, aromatic whiskey. Indeed, Trader Joe's Irish Cheddar 
with Irish Whiskey comes to us from a seasoned creamery in Ireland, whose expertise with spirits-infused 
cheeses has won them awards and accolades. Here, their Irish Cheddar is subtly flavored with authentic Irish 
Whiskey so that its delicately oaky and fruity notes complement, rather than overpower, the creamy texture 
and slight tanginess of the cheese.

Excellent for cheese boards, charcuterie plates, and party platters of all kinds (though especially for those 
served at St. Patrick's Day get-togethers!), Trader Joe's Irish Cheddar with Irish Whiskey can be enjoyed 
entirely on its own, or as part of a larger recipe. It's excellent when crumbled over salads, sliced and melted over 
a burger or grilled cheese, mixed into a macaroni bake, or any other dish that could do with a bit of creamy 
complexity. And for a fun, sublimely simple pairing, try a slice or two alongside our TJ's Special Reserve Irish 
Whiskey [65202], on the rocks or as part of highball.

"The three-leafed shamrock, first associated with Saint Patrick, has been an Irish symbol for several centuries. 
Unfortunately, we weren't able to fashion pieces of Trader Joe's Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese shaped like 
shamrocks, but we've made up for its ordinary cheese shape with its unique, festive flavor.

The milk from our Irish Porter Cheddar comes from cows grazing in the green fields of County Limerick 
and County Cork in western Ireland. The Cheddar curds, once formed, are mixed with Irish porter, which was 
known as ""plain porter"" or simply ""plain"" in Ireland when it was first created. It's a dark beer made with a few 
types of malt that gives the cheese its distinct marbled appearance and a decidedly roasted, malty taste. 

Clearly, this Irish Cheddar is ideal for enjoying with a St. Patrick's Day meal. Try it sliced with crusty, warm 
slices of an Organic French Baguette [sku 53835] and a pint of Guinness [sku 36383] to taste the full porter fla-
vors. Have it alongside a meal of Corned Beef [sku 50023] or Irish Bangers [sku 91090] and mashed potatoes, 
and toast sláinte* to those around you. 

We're selling random-weight pieces of Trader Joe's Irish Porter Cheddar Cheese for $9.99 per pound, but only 
during the season of St. Patrick.

Trader Joe's Fancy* Shredded Lite Mexican Blend is our ideal blend for dishes in need of a little Mexican flair, 
with Lite Sharp Cheddar, Lite Monterey Jack, Lite Asadero and Lite Queso Blanco cheeses. It's a blend that's 
unique to Trader Joe's, and because of this boasts a flavor profile just as unique as our brand. The Jack, Asadero 
and Queso Blanco are mild, while the Sharp Cheddar adds a bit of a bite with every mouthful.

All of the cheeses are well-known for their meltability, which makes them a particularly potent pairing to 
dishes like burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and tacos. And don't let the name make you feel like you need to 
limit yourself to Mexican dishes. This blend is excellent in plenty of salads, atop any of our boxed soups, and 
makes a distinctively flavored grilled cheese sandwich. And while we're at it, with TJ's Fancy Shredded Lite 
Mexican Blend, we are giving you this meltable delicacy with 50% less fat and 25% fewer calories than TJ's 
Shredded Mexican Blend [sku 82338].

*Fancy is not us being cheeky-it's a cheese industry term that refers to the thin size of the shred.

"When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, raw garlic's pungency can be tamed and transformed 
into an umami-rich wonderland of curiously complex, subtly sweet flavor with the power to elevate everyday 
cuisine to something else entirely. It's with this tasty transformation in mind that we introduce our limited-
edition Trader Joe's Black Garlic Cream Cheese Spread. It's a tangy cream cheese flecked with savory, 
fermented Black Garlic throughout, its flavor further bolstered by dried garlic and roasted garlic powder. 

A generous schmear of the stuff is an instant upgrade to your morning bagel and a delightful dip for crackers, 
crudité, and roasted Shishito Peppers [sku 54163]. It also makes a splendid sandwich Spread, and it enlivens 
everything from pasta sauces to baked potatoes.

"""The Queen of Cheeses"" - a regal nickname for a soft cheese with a storied history including being given as 
a tribute to be paid to French kings in the days of yore. While we don't suggest saving a slice of Trader Joe's 
Double Cream Brie for any current-day monarchs, we do think its a fitting cheese for the kings and queens of 
your household and their noble guests.

Made in traditional fashion, our Double Cream Brie uses raw pasteurized milk with microbial rennet added, 
curdled, then cast into a mold, salted, and lightly aged. With a melt-in-your-mouth quality, Trader Joe's 
Double Cream Brie is a buttery soft-ripened cheese that makes dreaming of a cheesy dessert worth skipping 
dinner altogether. The second you cut into this creamy wedge, you notice how soft, spreadable, and delicate 
it is. But don't think the experience stops there! As you get hit with the unmistakably striking scent when you 
cut through the bloomy rind, you begin to dream of the fruity, subtly nutty flavors to come. After dishing our 
Double Cream Brie up for dining, all that's left is to pour a glass of your favorite wine to pair it with.

"From their idyllic dairylands within the Groene Hart (literally ""Green Heart"") of mid-Western Holland, the 
craftspeople behind our newest Spotlight Cheese are dedicated to the art of creating fine, flavorful Goudas 
using traditional cheesemaking methods. Within their estimable assortment, they take particular pride in 
their selection of Jersey Goudas, made from the extra protein-and-calcium-rich milk of purebred Dutch 
Jersey cows. So, what do you get when you combine rich, full-flavored, high-quality milk with time-honored 
craftsmanship and expertise? You get Trader Joe's Jersey Gouda, of course!

Available for a limited time in our cheese section, Trader Joe's Jersey Gouda is aged for four to five months 
to give it a full body, creamy mouthfeel, and well-ripened, savory flavor. It's the kind of cheese that fits just as 
well on a grilled cheese sandwich as it does a full charcuterie spread, and is just as enjoyable when served with 
a chilled bottle of Chardonnay or Riesling as it is when idly snacked on, right out of the fridge. And for a nice 
bit of complementary sweetness and texture, you can't go wrong pairing this Jersey Gouda with fresh slices of 
Honeycrisp apple.

"Transport yourself to a European world: frolicking through an emerald field in wooden clogs while beautiful 
tulips bloom below a gently spinning windmill. Ah, the Netherlands! While that fertile soil and those lush 
green pastures feel great under the pitter-patter of Dutch clogs, it serves a deeper, culinary purpose. Those 
luxuriant fields are also great at nourishing cows that produce incomparably rich milk, making traditional 
goudas (such as our Red Wax Gouda [sku 12603]) the brazenly buttery cheese they are. But with cheeses such 
as Trader Joe's Double Cream Gouda, additional cream is added to the already rich Hollander milk, creating 
one of the most luscious beginnings to a batch of cheese found in a turophile's world.

A stunning Double Cream Gouda that is produced similarly to our other goudas, again, just with the 
supplementary cream added to the already rich pasteurized milk. Our supplier uses microbial enzymes 
making for a vegetarian friendly cheese and it's colored using annatto to help achieve the cheese's beautiful 
golden-orange color. The super high butterfat content - upwards of 60% - due to the added cream help make 
this cheese as decadent when snacked on by its lonesome as it is when melted into a hot dish in need of a 
cheesy companion.  So grab a wedge for a number of melty meals or to tack on your next cheeseboard at your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's for as little as $7.99* a pound today (often cut into half-pound wedges)!

"Feta Cheese is undeniably one of the most famous cheeses produced across the world. As a matter of fact, 
feta cheese makes up approximately 70% of its homeland's, Greece's, total cheese consumption. This soft and 
pasteurized cow's milk cheese is a salty, tangy, and unique offering, unmatched in the wide world of cheeses.

While across the feta world, each cheese maker may have minor differences in taste and texture, but on the 
whole, feta is a curd cheese that has a salty flavor and crumbly texture that is sometimes moistened by a salty 
brine once in its packaging. However, Trader Joe's Feta Cheese isn't packaged in a saline brine, making for a 
dry and tangy, but more neutral and less salty cheese than its brined siblings. Grab a package to bring a soft,

"Most of us cream cheese connoisseurs are likely to have a tub of Whipped Cream Cheese as well as traditional 
blocks of cream cheese hiding in our fridges. We like to keep Trader Joe's Whipped Cream Cheese on 
deck as a handy, creamy,  and spreadable schmear for your bagels and toast as well as using it for a few baking 
applications over traditional style cream cheeses.

Cream cheese is a simple, yet classic culinary staple finding its way into many recipes, whether they may be 
for savory dinners or delightful desserts. Our suppliers begin with premium pasteurized milk and cream and 
use cheese cultures during a heating process to create a luscious creamed cheese. But where our Whipped 
Cream Cheese strays the traditional path is with the final step of whipping air into the cream cheese mixture 
and adding more milk for a lighter, fluffier texture. This makes it perfect for when you just need a spreadable 
addition to your brunch-time bagel or to make, say, a less dense cream cheese frosting for a summer-friendly 
carrot or banana cake. The options are truly limitless and ready to make our shoppers into those type of

"A brick, or a block: what's the difference? It seems like a negligible distinction, but we take such distinctions 
seriously-especially when it comes to Trader Joe's Cream Cheese.

Within the cheese biz, this particular presentation of Cream Cheese is known as a ""brick."" Brick, however, 
sounds heavy, and this creamy creation is anything but. Made for us using fresh milk and cream from cows not 
treated with rBST, it's everything you want cream cheese to be-rich, creamy, and when softened, quite spread-
able. So, rather than ""brick,"" we'd like to refer to our Cream Cheese as a ""block,"" as in ""building block,"" since it 
can be a building block in so many delicious dishes.

What's that? You want examples? Sure. A simple appetizer idea: set it on a plate, top with salsa or sweet chili 
sauce and serve with tortilla chips or crackers for a Mexican or Thai inspired dip. How's that for instant versa-
tility? And speaking of dips, cream cheese is the star of any number of creamy dips. Don't forget bagels-but 
how could you forget bagels? Pretzel Bagels [sku 52370], maybe? Perhaps our favorite usage for this particular 
building block is cheesecake. If you're up to the challenge of making a cheesecake from scratch, you won't find 
a better foundation.

Perhaps the biggest WOW of all is our price of $1.69 for each eight-ounce block of certified kosher Trader Joe's 
Cream Cheese.

"Give your loved ones what they really want this year: cheese! Trader Joe's has a truly awesome assortment 
of cheeses; we have something special for everyone on your list. Some are everyday all-stars, and some are 
limited, seasonal sensations, like Trader Joe's Figgy Cheddar that's here just for the holidays. 

This mild Cheddar is produced for us in Leicestershire, UK, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise. 
Mini-Spanish Figs are marinated in white wine, rum, and a blend of warming spices- like coriander, 
cinnamon, ginger, fennel, nutmeg, and cloves-then mixed right into the cheese. The result is a creamy, mild 
Cheddar, studded with marinated Fig pieces. It makes a wonderful addition to a cheeseboard and is superb 
for snacking. If you've ever had apple pie with a slice of Cheddar on top, consider serving with a slice of 
this Cheddar instead. Pro-tip: this cheese benefits tremendously from being taken out of the refrigerator 30 
minutes before serving. 

You'll find random-weight wedges of Trader Joe's Figgy Cheddar among our other cheesy offerings this 
holiday season, while supplies last.

"Blue cheese can be polarizing. People either love it and can't get enough, or they can't get away from it fast 
enough. This holiday season, we're offering a new cheese that may just bridge that gap and please both blue 
cheese connoisseurs and newcomers, alike: Trader Joe's Dolce Creamy Gorgonzola Style Cheese! 

While the name may be a tad clunky to say, every bite melts in the mouth. Each wedge has the quintessential 
blue veins running through it, typical of a classic Gorgonzola, with the robust, earthy attributes you'd expect. 
What may surprise you, however, is how those notes mellow with a delicate, sweet (or Dolce, if you speak 
Italian) finish. It's the sort of Cheese that offers a different tasting experience with every bite. Before serving, 
let the wedge sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes. This will help tame the aroma and the texture will 
soften to an incredibly creamy consistency. 

It makes an impressive addition to a cheese board and a fantastic filling for Organic Pitted Medjool Dates [sku 
64778]. You can even melt it down into a Creamy pasta sauce! We're selling this special cheese in eight-ounce 
wedges. You'll find it in our cheese section for a limited time.

"Among Spain's many contributions to the culinary world, Spanish cheeses and Spanish olives may be among 
their best. Our latest Spotlight Cheese, Gran Capitan Oliva Negra, is a savory salute to these two Spanish 
specialties. Made by the same supplier as previous Spotlight entry Gran Capitan Reserva [sku 69017], Gran 
Capitan Oliva Negra follows its predecessors' suit in being made with a mix of multiple kinds of milk, this 
time combining cow, sheep, and goat for a complex range of creaminess, nuttiness, and tartness. Where it truly 
sets itself apart, however, is in the introduction of rich veins of briny black olive paste, which brings on a whole 
other level of umami-forward flavors to every bite. 

As the largest producer of olives on the planet, providing roughly half the world's olive oil every year, Spain is 
well celebrated for its olives, and Gran Capitan Oliva Negra feels like a celebration in and of itself. We find that 
its easy, Manchego-like texture and assertive flavors of olive make it an ideal inclusion for any charcuterie board 
or cheese plate. We recommend pairing it up with some fresh, sliced stonefruit, a handful of Rosemary Marcona 
Almonds [sku 90083], and, if you'd really like to enjoy the full expression of the Spanish olive experience, a light 
drizzle of our Spanish Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 80616]. ¡Buen provecho!

"No need to be sheepish about it: Trader Joe's Aged Sheep's Milk Cheese stands out from the rest of the 
flock-and not just because the fresh Sheep's Milk is sourced from some of the finest dairy farms in Toledo, 
Spain. Each ivory-hued block is also marinated in aromatic, PDO Cornicabra Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and 
Aged between three and five months to further develop its characteristic flavor. (Fun fact: cornicabra means 
""goat's horn,"" as the olives used to produce this revered oil are oval-shaped, with a small horn on one side.) 
The oil lends a robust, pleasantly bitter flavor and green, grassy aromas that produce a particularly unique and 
delicious eating experience when paired with the mild, nutty flavors of the Aged Sheep's Milk Cheese.

Serve this firm-yet-creamy Cheese as an appetizer before the big holiday meal, alongside a bowl of Nuts About 
Rosemary Mix [sku 63977] and juicy Honeycrisp apple slices. Or let a freshly toasted Ciabatta Roll [sku 97438] 
soak up the olive oil as the Cheese accompanies an array of leftovers in sandwich form. You'll find Trader Joe's

"Last year, we introduced Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread [sku 74802] to the world. Made with a 
base of our Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923], plus salted butter and whey, this superbly creamy Spread proved 
an instant hit, charming customers with its savory, umami-tinged flavor, and super smooth texture. This year, 
we're giving this cheese yet another surprising turn: behold, Trader Joe's Holiday Cheer Unexpected Cheddar 
Cheese Spread! This wintry iteration builds on the original's savory spreadability with the inclusion of dried, 
sweetened cranberry bits, a touch of cinnamon, and a splash of Riesling. 

Even we're not quite sure how our supplier has done it, but believe us when we say: this Spread genuinely tastes 
like Holiday Cheer. Creamy, fruity, and savory all at once, it makes an excellent addition to any holiday hors 
d'oeuvres table, especially when paired with crackers or crusty bread. We also love it as a topping for sliced 
strawberries, apples, or Fuyu Persimmons [sku 95578]. And when the feasts and festivities are over, it adds a 
phenomenal level of flavor when used as a spread for sandwiches loaded with leftovers.

"When it comes to cheese, we don't just talk the talk. We walk the walk. Or rather, we ride the planes, trains, 
boats, whatever means of conveyance we can, really, to find amazing cheeses from all over the world. We take 
our cheeses seriously, and we know our customers do too, so we're willing to trek wherever necessary to find 
the real deal.

For one stop in our cheese-fueled world tour, we visited the Netherlands, the iconic home of windmills, tulip 
booms, and Trader Joe's 1,000 Day Gouda Cheese. It was there that we found the veteran cheese makers 
who hold the secret to ideal affinage-the art of caring for aging cheese-necessary for aging Gouda for such 
a prolonged period of time. During the maturation process, the cheese loses close to a quarter of its original 
weight, as its moisture content slowly but surely evaporates, condensing its naturally salty, caramel-y, and 
supremely savory flavor profile, without drying out completely. It's an intricate balance, and one that produces 
an unbelievably flavorful cheese.

It's a long journey from the Dutch aging cellars to our cheese case, but it's a journey well worth taking. It's a 
delicious enough cheese that you may just find yourself idly snacking on it (we certainly won't judge), but if

"We have no guilt in admitting a freshly opened bag of Trader Joe's Shredded Mozzarella Cheese is a tempting 
shortcut to eschew any skinned knuckles and wasted time grating your own mozzarella. While taking the 
time to make it yourself has its place, we really try our best to deliver you the freshest, softest, and stretchiest 
Shredded Mozzarella Cheese we can find! 

Whether oozing off of a slice of pizza or layered in a pan of lasagna, Trader Joe's Shredded Mozzarella 
Cheese is ready to include in many dishes for a melted, stringy, and flavorful cheese addition. Our mozzarella 
fior di latte, the Italian terminology for cow's milk mozzarella, is made with pasteurized part-skim milk, 
bacterial cheese cultures, vegetable rennet, and just a few other preservative ingredients. Pasta filata, again, 
an Italian term, but this time for the mozz making process, is as simple as starting with fresh whey and cheese 
cultures, adding the vegetable rennet, and then heating in water to form a stringy and elastic cheese that can be 
kneaded and then shredded; ready for you to sprinkle and melt on whatever you'd like!

"Ten miles off the northern coast of Scotland sit the Orkney Islands, a relatively isolated archipelago of isles 
known for their mild climate and remarkable amount of Neolithic artefacts. Each island is covered in lush, green 
grass, making it ideal grazing land for dairy cattle, a fact that's neatly demonstrated by the quality of our latest 
Spotlight Cheese, Orkney Mature Scottish Island Cheddar. Mild, creamy, and delicious, it's made exclusively 
from milk produced on Orkney dairy farms, meaning every bite is a taste of the idyllic islands from which it 
came.

Orkney Cheddar is inextricably intertwined with the Orkney Islands - even its packaging lovingly depicts the 
Islands' iconic Ring of Brodgar archeological site. As such, its remarkably creamy and mellow flavor profile all 
the more reflects the care and expertise of its artisan cheesemakers. On first taste, the Orkney is mild and easy, 
with a faint sharp edge on the finish. As you continue to savor its smooth, silky mouth feel, the sharpness builds 
more and more, and you begin to detect subtle sweet and nutty notes. Just complex enough to fascinate, but not 
so much as to overwhelm, Orkney Cheddar is gentle, alluring, and full of surprises - much like the Orkney 
Islands themselves.

On its own as part of a cheese plate, or melted into a particularly delicious grilled cheese (or even over some 
Trader Potato Tots [sku 94904] for a perfect Scottish pub-style snack), Orkney Mature Scottish Island Cheddar 
is an edible celebration of Scotland's Orkney Islands. And, while supplies last, Trader Joe's will be the only store 
you can find it in outside of the U.K. We're selling seven-ounce, pre-cut pieces for $4.99. Grab it while you can!

"This is a product that really makes us want to have a Caprese salad for lunch. Or dinner. And because Trader 
Joe's Fresh Mozzarella Log is so fresh and so easy to use, making that salad will be easier than ever. Inside the 
package are slices of fresh mozzarella, perfectly sized to perch atop a substantial slice of tomato, and longing 
to be topped with a basil leaf. Instant Insalata Caprese, no cheese slicing required. Each package contains 16 
ounces of Fresh Mozzarella, crafted with milk from cows - primarily from Idaho's fertile Treasure Valley - not 
treated with rBST. The cheese is mild and milky and fresh-tasting, as a good Fresh Mozzarella should always 
be.
 
When it comes time to craft that Caprese, be sure to pick up a Basil Plant [sku 64183]and some Organic Tomatoes 
on the Vine [sku 97266], and some good olive oil & balsamic vinegar to round out the recipe (you could also 
choose from the myriad dressing options you'll find on our grocery shelves or in our refrigerator case). Of 
course, you can also use this pre-sliced Fresh Mozzarella Log for panini, pizza, or cut into smaller pieces to 
toss into a salad.

"Where would we be without cream cheese? Could you imagine a world where bagels go bare? Where jalapeño 
poppers go un-packed? Where cheesecakes are simply... cakes? Well, we at Trader Joe's are doing our part to 
ensure that such a sorry scenario never becomes a reality, by carrying a number of delectable cream cheeses in 
our refrigerators, including Trader Joe's Organic Plain Cream Cheese Spread. Made with organic, pasteurized 
milk and cream, this soft, spreadable, and highly versatile Cream Cheese has a remarkable range of uses, from 
the extravagant to the everyday.

In the morning, this Cream Cheese is excellent on an Everything Bagel [sku 92267] with your favorite smoked 
salmon, of course, and also adds a luxurious element when mixed into scrambled eggs,  omelets, and frittatas. 
At midday, it's ideal for spreading on veggies sandwiches or enjoying with cucumber slices and celery sticks for 
a crunchy snack. At night, it works wonders in seafood chowders, savory dips, or mashed potatoes. And for 
dessert? Trader Joe's Organic Plain Cream Cheese Spread simply excels when swirled into brownies, mixed 
into fluffy frostings, or baked into moist, delicious pound cake.

"If you frequent the cheese case at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, you'll notice we like to riff on ricotta. Baked 
ricotta in particular is a creamy, cheesy canvas that's ripe for seasonal interpretations of all sorts-like our latest 
rendition for fall, Trader Joe's Baked Sheep's Milk Ricotta Cheese with Herbs de Provence. (Side note: if you 
haven't tried the Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese [sku 57341] on offer during the holidays, make this your year!)

To craft this one-of-a-kind Ricotta, our Sicilian supplier starts with a base blend of sheep's whey, sheep's milk, 
and salt. The resulting curd is seasoned with Herbs de Provence-specifically, rosemary, oregano, savory, 
thyme, and basil-then placed into a circular mold and baked at low temperatures. The process yields a savory 
Baked Sheep's Milk Ricotta with a texture akin to cheesecake. It's super scoopable, fabulously forkable, and 
utterly irresistible. Go the cheese board route and serve it alongside our Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps [sku 51246] 
and sliced Honeycrisp Apples [sku 93872]. Fancy up breakfast and fold it into an omelet. Or present it as a 
dreamy dessert with nothing more than a drizzle of our Mostly Mesquite Honey [sku 09146] and a spoon. This 
exclusive-to-TJ's Baked Sheep's Milk Ricotta Cheese with Herbs de Provence is available in random-weight

"Tucked away in the northern edge of France, just a mile or two from the Belgian border, the quiet commune 
of Jenlain is home to Brasserie Duyck, the world's most preeminent producer of beers in the Bière de Garde 
style. Characterized by rich malts and enticingly tart notes, Jenlain beers pair particularly well with soft, ripe 
cheeses, a fact that serves as the inspiration for this tour de force of fromage. Starting with a base of creamy, 
semisoft cheese, our supplier washes the rind with a generous amount of Jenlain beer, which imparts a light 
earthiness and faint caramel note throughout. They call it Délice de Jenlain: we call it an essential entry into 
the Spotlight Cheese series.

Just like the beer that gives it its name and distinctive flavor, Trader Joe's Délice de Jenlain is delightfully rustic, 
elegantly delicious, and uniquely French. With its characteristically profound aroma, well-rounded texture and 
well-balanced flavor profile, marked by subtly sweet notes of malt and yeast, it makes a welcome addition to 
any cheese plate or charcuterie board, and an especially apt hors d'oeuvre for a cocktail party. Serve it over 
crackers, with sliced apples or pears, or melt it into a truly luxurious grilled cheese with sautéed mushrooms 
and caramelized onions.

"While it's easy to think of it primarily as a luxurious complement to other foods, cream cheese is actually a 
suprisingly crucial component within the vast culinary canon. Aside from being a boon to bagels, cream cheese 
is essential in a wide variety of baked goods, soups, sauces, and so much more-which it makes it all the more 
challenging to work with if you have a lactose-free diet. That's where Trader Joe's Lactose Free Cream Cheese 
comes in. Made with lactase, the enzyme that naturally breaks down lactose, it has all the same delicately tart 
flavor and superb spreadability you'd expect from a Cream Cheese, and absolutely none of the lactose.

Just like its lactose-containing cousins, Trader Joe's Lactose Free Cream Cheese can be used in a plethora 
of rich, delicious recipes, from fantastically full-flavored appetizer dips to consummately creamy chowders, 
to sweet and fluffy frostings for carrot cake, brownies, or homemade whoopie pies. It adds body and a nice 
depth of flavor when mixed into a baked macaroni and cheese or casserole, it makes for a marvelous Lactose 
Free cheesecake, and a spoonful will even elevate a simple pan of scrambled eggs. And, of course, it's also 
quite delicious as a topping for a bagel, especially when paired with a bit of our Wild Sockeye Smoked Salmon 
[sku  60442].

"Like the original Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread [sku 74802] that inspired it, new Trader Joe's Unexpected 
Cheddar Cheese Spread with Hatch Chile begins, unsurprisingly, with our storied Unexpected Cheddar [sku 
96923]. The Unexpected Cheddar-a perennial customer favorite-is made spreadable by the addition of salted 
butter, cream, and whey. Then, for this unexpected, turn-up-the-heat take, we've added diced New Mexican 
Hatch chiles, bell peppers, and a kick of cayenne. The end result? Three letters: W-O-W. No matter how you 
slice-er, spread-it, it's a real crowd-cheeser. Our tasting panel couldn't get enough of the stuff!

While we're on the subject of ""WOWs,"" we're pleased to be offering  our Unexpected Cheddar Cheese Spread

"Situated on the very tip of the westernmost peninsula in Marin County, CA, the idyllic rolling hills of Point 
Reyes host some of the finest dairy farms in the world. One such dairy farm, the Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese 
Company, has been family-owned and operated for over 50 years, crafting blues, cheddars, mozzarellas, and, of 
course, their signature cheese, the Point Reyes Toma [sku 63690]. Italian for ""wheel of cheese made personally 
by the farmer"", Point Reyes's award-winning (and TJ's Spotlight Cheese alum) Toma has proven so popular, 
that Point Reyes has recently taken to offering variations on the Toma theme-including our newest Spotlight 
Cheese, the auspiciously herby Point Reyes TomaProvence.

Made with the same base as their celebrated Toma and TomaTruffle [sku 74726] (another former Spotlight 
fave) Point Reyes TomaProvence sets itself apart via the inclusion of a mix of aromatic herbs de provence, 
including rosemary, basil, savory, thyme, and marjoram. The resulting cheese is rich and herbaceous, with 
the same easy-eating, sem-firm texture that made us fall in love with the original Toma. Try it as part of a 
charcuterie board with olives, Marinated Artichokes [sku 49746], and Uncured Salame de Parma [sku 58940]. 
Enjoy it sliced or shredded in a grilled cheese, patty melt, or omelet. Or, simply enjoy it as a solitary, anytime 
snacking cheese, with or without a chilled glass of buttery Chardonnay.

"Like its famed forebearer, Fromage Pavé [sku 57335], Trader Joe's Red Chili Pepper Fromage Pavé is a square, 
soft-ripened French cheese made from milk that undergoes an ultrafiltration process, ostensibly removing the 
whey from the milk before the cheesemaking process begins. As a result, the cheese ripens faster-you get a 
60% butterfat, double crème Fromage that's ready to enjoy after just two weeks of aging. 

What sets this Pavé apart is its tongue-tingling triumvirate of jalapeño, cayenne, and red bell peppers. 
Together, they lend a fiery kick of heat and a splash of color to the cheese's mild and buttery base. If you're a 
fan of soft-ripened cheeses and all things spicy, Trader Joe's Red Chili Pepper Fromage Pavé belongs on your 
list... and your cheese board. Serve alongside Sliced Prosciutto [sku 98861], Envy Apple [sku 58248] slices, and 
Whole Grain Crispbread [sku 55902]. It adds a splendid spiciness to sandwiches, too. Spread our Red Chili 
Pepper Fromage Pavé on a crusty Organic Baguette [sku 53835], topped with Uncured Salame Di Parma Mild 
Salami [sku 58940] for a pleasantly spicy, simply delicious sandwich. You'll find seven-ounce squares in our 
refrigerators while we can keep them in stock.

"Admittedly, ""cheese alternative"" isn't the most appealing title. That's why we called our latest product in this 
vegan vein, Trader Joe's Mozzarella Style Shreds. Not only is this a better name, it really does describe the 
eating experience of this product!

We sampled lots and lots of dairy-free ""cheeses"" and finally settled on this one from a California-based supplier. 
They start with a crushed-cashew and water base and fortify it with coconut oil, and potato & corn starches. Sea 
salt and yeast extract add to the ""cheesy"" flavor, but it's really the curing of the cashew base over several weeks 
(a process not too unlike the culturing of real cheese) that gives these Shreds their authentic Mozzarella-Style 
flavor. 

In fact, we think this is such a good cheese alternative, you'll find the seven-ounce, re-sealable bag of Trader 
Joe's Mozzarella Style Shreds hanging in our refrigerators every day, right next to our other shredded cheeses!

"Cashews have been doing some amazing things for non-dairy cheese alternatives, lately. In what can only be 
described as acts of remarkable faux-fromage ingenuity, we've seen this humble nut transform into all kinds of 
cheese-like snacks, including our nacho-esque Cashew Fiesta Dip [sku 61494]. Today, we're proud to announce 
yet another bold leap of progress for the cashew/dairy-free alliance, Trader Joe's Dairy Free Cheddar Style 
Slices, a handy pack of ready-to-go slices of vegan cultured cashew ""cheese"" that tastes, feels, and melts just like 
a slice of regular old Cheddar.

How, you ask? Our supplier puts this cashew cheese alternative through a culturating and aging process inspired 
by traditional cheesemaking techniques. This not only gives each Slice a moderately sharp, Cheddar-like flavor, 
but mellows its texture to a degree where it melts nice and evenly. Which can only mean one thing: the dream 
of a satisfyingly melty vegan grilled cheese is now a reality! Trader Joe's Dairy Free Cheddar Style Slices, 
proudly made from cashews, are just the thing for topping vegan burgers (Protein Patty [sku 65240], anyone?), 
making dairy-free omelets, or even simply snacking on. We're selling seven ounce packs, each containing nine 
Slices, for $3.99*. Look for them in our cheese case.

"Imagine yourself as a French immigrant in 1800s Wisconsin, longing for the cheese of your homeland without 
the convenience of modern express shipping. So you head to the kitchen and begin making it the way you 
always used to, trying to imitate French Munster cheese. While that may sound like ancient history, think of it 
as the beginning of American Muenster, and by extension, the birth of Trader Joe's Sliced Muenster Cheese.

Our Sliced Muenster Cheese is far from the original French Munster; it doesn't undergo rind-washing or 
aging, so its flavor is mellow with a pleasant tang-a bit like our Sliced Pepper Jack [sku 73328] without the 
added peppers. The distinctive red-orange rind you see gets its color from annatto (the same natural vegetable 
dye used to give Cheddars their vibrant orange hues.) Trader Joe's Sliced Muenster Cheese marries this 
appearance, texture, and flavor into what is considered one of the great original American cheeses. With a 
semi-soft texture from the package, the versatility of our Sliced Muenster is unmatched. Use it with cold cuts 
or take advantage of its flawless melting ability and top a variety of hot dishes.

"For fans of the stuff, seeing Burrata on a restaurant menu is known to elicit shrieks of excitement and

or so years we've carried it on our shelves for that very reason. But break open a ball of Burrata, and you'll be 
delighted to discover soft, stretchy curds comingling with rich cream in its center, with a touch of sea salt to 
balance its slightly sweet, milky aroma. Creamy and almost cloud-like, it's a cheese-lover's dream, with only 
the simplest accompaniment needed to allow it to shine. Looking for palatable partners? How about fresh 
cantaloupe slices and balsamic vinegar? Perhaps some grilled peaches and mixed greens? Or maybe on pizza, 
with slow roasted tomatoes and basil, a glug of extra virgin olive oil, and a few cracks of sea salt¿

We're offering kosher-certified, eight-ounce tubs of Trader Joe's Burrata for $4.99, everyday. Each tub contains 
two generously sized balls of Burrata, so there's plenty to share with the other Burrata fans in your life (if you're

"At Trader Joe's, we endeavor to provide as many plant-based options for our customers as possible, even (and 
especially!) when the challenge is considerable. Our most recent venture in finding vegan versions of normally 
non-vegan fare brought us to a supplier in Greece, who specializes in plant-based cheese alternatives. They 
made for us this Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend, which combines a variety of vegan cheese 
alternatives into a single, peppery, plant-based blend. We were intrigued. Then, when we saw how well it 
melted (a notoriously difficult feat for non-dairy products), we were hooked. We think you'll be, too. 

Savory, spicy, and remarkably creamy, Trader Joe's Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend is great 
for any situation that calls for cheese: topping tacos, filling quesadillas, sprinkling over salads-you name it. 
With its blend of vegan shreds and savory spices, including cayenne, cumin, and dried jalapeño peppers, it 
brings a pleasant, building heat to any dish it's added to. While it's especially suited for Mexican, Tex Mex, or 
Southwest cuisines, we certainly wouldn't stop there: try it on a plant based patty melt with Impossible Burger 
[sku 69857] or a stuffed bell pepper, and you'll see exactly what we mean.

"Feta is one of those cheeses that makes you think of a particular geographic region (in this case, the Mediter-
ranean), yet is actually made all around the world. In much the same way Swiss cheese is made outside of 
Switzerland, and you can find delicious Brie made both in and out of France, great-tasting Feta is crafted by 
cheesemakers the world over. The cheese inside every tub of Trader Joe's Crumbled Feta is made for us by a 
fourth generation Wisconsin cheesemaking family, still making cheese where their founding father founded 
the family creamery in the late 19th century. 

The recipe for our Crumbled Feta is simple. It begins with high quality Wisconsin milk from cows that haven't 
been treated with synthetic growth hormones. That milk is expertly transformed into firm, crumbly, salty, tangy 
Feta Cheese, crumbled into bite-sized (or smaller!) pieces, and packed in a resealable tub. The process is simple; 
the result is magical. 

The process may be magical, but the real wonder comes when you put the Feta to use. Sprinkle it onto salads 
or pizzas for a tangy, creamy addition. Stuff it into sandwiches with hummus and Falafel [sku 93935], or melt 
it atop a burger.

"For our latest Spotlight Cheese, we've turned once again to the English countryside, home to some of the finest 
dairy farms and cheesemakers in the world, including the producer of our much-celebrated Cheddar Cheese 
with Caramelized Onions [sku 52381]. This same producer has custom-formulated a brand new cheese-herb 
combination just for us: using their own delicious farmhouse Cheddar as a base, and with a welcome addition 
of tasty bits of chive and onion, they then take the extra step of cold-smoking the cheese over oak chips for 
several hours. The result is Trader Joe's Smoked English Cheddar Cheese with Spring Onion & Chive, a 
marvelous mix of savory flavors and smoky notes - just the kind of surprising, standout cheese you'd expect 
for a Spotlight entry.

If you've never tried a smoked cheese before, you're in for quite a revelation. Because each piece of this Smoked 
English Cheddar is cold-smoked, rather than flavored with artificial smoke, it develops a delightfully present 
(but never overpowering) smokiness that accents the creaminess of rustic English Cheddar perfectly. Combined 
with its spot-on herby notes, courtesy of a diligently-honed ratio of real chives and onions, it makes an excellent 
addition to burgers, pizzas, and positively shines as the base for a smoky baked macaroni and cheese.

For a limited time, we're selling Trader Joe's Smoked English Cheddar Cheese with Spring Onion & Chive 
for the smokin' hot price of $8.99 per pound - a true bargain in the often-exorbitant world of smoked cheeses. 
While supplies last, you'll find it in our cheese case.

"England's highly esteemed Stilton® cheese has been made in the exact same way and in the exact same places 
as it has been for hundreds of years. It's so revered, in fact, that it's protected by the European Union with a 
PDO, or protected designation of origin, to ensure any cheese bearing the name lives up to its spectacular 
reputation-cheeses like Trader Joe's Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese. 

Produced for us in Leicestershire, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise, this White Stilton® is made 
only from locally pasteurized cow's milk, infused with a pleasant punch of pomegranate powder and fruity, 
freeze-dried Strawberry pieces. It's formed into a cylindrical shape, but is not pressed during its one-month 
aging period to help create an airy texture. The result is a sensationally light, slightly tangy cheese that offers 
pops of sweetness throughout, complement the savory nature and creamy-crumbly texture of the base.

Consider crumbling a handful of this Strawberry White Stilton® Cheese on a salad or melting a thick slice on 
a steak. It also presents particularly well on a cheeseboard alongside fresh strawberries (plan ahead-it's best 
enjoyed after a 30-minute rest at room temperature). And since each mini-Cheese wheel (endearingly called a 
truckle in the cheese world) is encased in a thick, non-edible, bright red wax, it can be easily popped in a purse 
or packed in a picnic basket-don't forget the cutting board and knife!

speckled throughout with Madagascar Vanilla Bean flecks. With only one gram of added sugar, this cultured 
Crème tastes impressively balanced: sweet, but not too sweet- tangy, but not too tangy. You might call it the 
secret to your summertime sweet-treat success! Try it as a dip for berries, a frosting for cakes and cupcakes, a 
topping for pancakes and waffles, or the base for parfaits. We'll admit our favorite way to eat it just might be 
straight out of the tub with a spoon! This creamy delight is only available for a limited time, so hurry down to 
your neighborhood Trader Joe's and pick up an eight-ounce tub while you can.

"Get your cheese board down, 'cause we're going to blueberry fields
Wedges from wheels, Sweet-savory aged cow's milk
Blueberry fields forever
-with apologies to The Beatles

When a truly phenomenal cheese is put forth at the tasting panel, it's not uncommon for our tasters to burst 
into song¿ OK, that might be stretching things a bit, but after one bite of Trader Joe's Blueberry Fields 
Hard Cheese, it's easy to see why taste buds were singing the day it was approved. This Hard Cheese (think 
Fontina in texture, but with a bit more sharpness) is made with raw cow's milk; the rind that surrounds the 
savory, creamy white base is then bathed in a Blueberry purée, adding complementary sweet-tart notes to each 
pleasantly nutty bite and a contrasting, inky blue hue to the exterior. 

Our Wisconsin cheesemonger concocts this Blueberry beauty in small batches and cures it using top-secret, 
artisanal methods to achieve its delicate texture-this makes the Cheese ideal for slicing and serving on 
summer cheese boards, melting in a turkey panini, or shaving atop a spinach salad with fresh blueberries & 
candied pecans. You'll find random-weight wedges (around a half-a-pound each) in our cheese case at a price 
that'll have you saying ""Cheese!"" all summer long...

"When happening upon a wedge of our latest Spotlight Cheese, Saint Paulin, at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, 
the first thing that will likely catch your eye is its signature golden-orange rind. Like its culinary cousin Port 
Salut [sku 81205], Saint Paulin was originally created by Trappist monks in France, and its vibrant exterior 
is an artifact of the traditional cheesemaking methods that are still employed in its production. As the cheese 
ages, it's washed in brine to increase the presence of a particular bacteria strain, which creates an enzyme that 
helps each wheel of Saintt Paulin develop its mild, buttery flavor, and rich, floral aroma-and also just happens 
to leave a vibrantly ruddy hue. 

Delectably creamy, with a smooth, semisoft consistency and totally edible rind (another benefit of the brine 
washing process), our Saint Paulin makes an attractive addition to any charcuterie board or cheese plate. We 
find that it's especially suited for pairing with sweeter flavors, like fresh cut fruit, Fig Butter [sku 96478], or our 
Spicy Honey Sauce [sku 76116]. For an elevated take on comfort food fare, try slicing it and adding it to a grilled 
cheese, panini, or patty melt.

"A Swiss cheese without holes? You must be joking! Well, look again and you'll uncover a dense, firm, pale 
yellow Swiss cheese that is naturally smooth and devoid of the ""eyes"" found in its sibling cheese. Cave Aged 
Le Gruyère Switzerland AOP Cheese is our Gruyère offering, bringing the Medieval Alpine cheese to live 
amongst our fridges and be discovered by our shoppers for a creamy, nutty flavor not found in other cheeses.

An inimitable flavor and made with the utmost regard for quality, Cave Aged Le Gruyère's production can be 
distilled into eight simple parts: the use of high quality, part skim cow's milk; curdling of the milk in copper 
vats; cutting, mixing, and heating the curds; placing the paste into molds; bathing in salt and beginning the 
cheese's storage; maturation in aging cellars; taxation by experts to denote that the cheese is of the quality to 
bear the Le Gruyère AOP name; and additional maturation time. The additional maturation of this specific Le 
Gruyère is a key to the final taste and texture. It's aged in extremely humid ""affinage"" (maturation) cellars to 
keep the cheese moist while taking on the strong, bold flavors of a cheese that's been given time alone to age.

Not every cheese turns to a warm, decadent, ooey gooey pool of delight that you want to dive and dip into, but 
with Gruyère, we do get that pleasure. It takes a cheese made with rennet (as opposed to a cheese curdled with 
acid) to be a melting cheese, and then it takes a cheese with a high water-to-fat ratio to be a good melting cheese. 
Trader Joe's Cave Aged Le Gruyère is a good melting cheese and goes wonderfully melted into sandwiches or 
enjoyed at room temp, solid, firm, and delicious!

"Based in Wisconsin, A-list cheesemaker Carr Valley has won more top national and international awards than 
any other cheesemaker in North America. It's with this pedigree in mind that we're shining the April Spotlight 
on their Sweet Vanilla Cardona Cheese. Handcrafted with fresh Wisconsin goat milk sourced from local 
farms, aromatic vanilla bean and sweet vanilla sugar are added to the cheese when it's removed from the brine. 
Over a few weeks of aging, the cheese develops notes of toasted caramel, coconut, and nutmeg, and the vanilla 
bean specks elegantly dot the edible rind, resulting in a fantastically fancy fromage that's more than ready for 
its cheese board close-up. 

This subtly sweet, delicate wedge of Cheese is a standout snack all on its own, but to further elevate its toasty 
vanilla notes, cut it into cubes and serve with a dollop of Fresh Strawberry Preserves [sku 87785]; pairing it with 
the bursting berry flavors and toasted oak notes in a magnetic glass of Monterra Merlot [sku 68097] will have 
the same scrumptious effect. Or for a doubly delicious, high-drama dessert, shred this Sweet Vanilla Cardona 
Cheese over a bowl of Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883]!

"The Dolomite mountain range of Italy is a renowned destination for skiers, cyclists and even stair climbers - it's home 
to the Calà del Sasso, the world's longest staircase open to the public at 4,444 steps. The Dolomite mountain range 
is also renowned for its cheeses, and happens to be the home of Trader Joe's Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs.

Our Bigonda Cheese is made for us by a master cheese-making family in the Trentino province, with over 80 years 
of experience under their belts. The milk used in the making of this cheese comes from cattle that graze on the 
breathtaking mountain pastures of the Dolomites. The clean air and lush mountain grasses help the cows produce 
supremely fresh milk, ideal for making this traditional style of Italian farmstead cheese, known as caciotta, that has 
a semi-soft texture with a creamy, firm consistency. While there are variations on the style (some cheese makers add 
black pepper or olive oil), our Bigonda Cheese is studded with laurel, thyme, parsley, organic chives, fennel and 
caraway seeds, juxtaposing fragrant Herbs with the slightly sweet, fresh milk notes of the cheese. 

The beauty of Bigonda is its versatility - you can melt it into an omelet or on a grilled cheese sandwich, or try it cut 
into cubes atop a green salad with extra virgin olive oil, garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. Liven up a cheese 
plate with sliced Bigonda and a foil of sweet fig jam, crunchy Marcona almonds and crisp white wine.

"What's the best thing since sliced bread? Sliced cheese, of course. Sliced cheese like Trader Joe's Sliced Sharp 
Cheddar.  

Trader Joe's Sliced Sharp Cheddar is made for us under the supervision of two Wisconsin Master Cheesemakers, 
using milk from local family farms. It's a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored ""cheddaring"" 
process first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional 
cheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they've been cut and turned. It's a time and 
labor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more ""modern"" 
cheddaring methods like stirring the curds.

The flavor and texture of Cheddar changes dramatically as it ages, to our eternal delight. Our Sliced Sharp 
Cheddar is aged four to six months, just enough time to develop its rich, creamy, nutty flavor and almost-but-
not-quite-ready-to-crumble texture. This complexity makes it an ideal mate for a burger, and it's also excellent 
in cold sandwiches, panini, tuna melts, and omelets. Each slice is separated by parchment, making it easy to 
use and ideal for anytime at all. We're selling each 12 ounce package of 12 slices for $3.99, every day. This is a

with exceptional and rare flavor combinations. Case in point: Wildfire Blue. Made by the expert cheesemaking 
team at Carr Valley Cheese, this Wisconsin blue starts with a classically creamy, perfectly salty, remarkably 
expressive blue cheese profile, complete with rich blue veins streaked throughout. They then take things to 
the next level with the addition of pepperoncini pepper flakes, turning the cheese into a masterclass in multi-
faceted flavors. Each soft, melt-in-your-mouth bite becomes a marvelous mix of creaminess, fiery heat, and 
ripe blue notes of salted caramel-in other words, a combination that will light up your senses like wildfire.

So, what to do with a spicy blue? Aside from simply enjoying it on its own or as part of a cheese plate (an 
excellent option, especially when drizzled with your favorite honey, we might add), Wildfire Blue's unique 
spicy-sweet-salty profile makes it a great addition to most savory fare. Try adding a few crumbles to the top 
of a freshly grilled burger or steak, or mixing into a batch of macaroni and cheese, for starters-speaking of 
starters, how about a Wildfire Blue-stuffed jalapeño popper? Whatever your pleasure, make sure to act fast, 
because quantities are limited.

"Over the years, we've offered Toscano Cheese in a number of iterations-some seasonal, some available every 
day. One of our perennial favorites is Trader Joe's Toscano Cheese with Black Pepper, an exceptional cheese 
that you don't have to save for a special occasion. As it ages, each wheel of cheese is hand-rubbed with cracked 
black pepper, so every wedge features a burst of mildly spicy pepper flavor-the closer you get to the outside 
of the wheel, the more pronounced the flavor becomes, yet it's never overpowering. Serve it on crackers, grated 
over pasta or shaved onto a freshly prepared steak. It's priced at $9.99 per pound, (random-weight wedges of 
about eight ounces will be somewhere in the vicinity of $5), so you can serve it often. You'll find it in our cheese case.

"Unless you've tasted chocolate cheesecake or tried homemade brownies with a cream-cheese swirl, you've 
probably never enjoyed the pleasure of the cocoa & curds combination. We can personally vouch for the 
dreamy flavor of a creamy cheese and rich cocoa concoction-but why just take our word for it when you can 
just buy a tub of our Hot Cocoa Inspired Cream Cheese Spread and taste what we mean?!

What appears as an unassuming eight-ounce container of cream cheese, is actually a novel schmear with a 
recipe that's unique to Trader Joe's. The cheese base, made from pasteurized milk and cream, is blended with 
cocoa until it's smooth and spreadable. These flavors are sweetened with sugar, and balanced with a touch of 
salt. A hint of natural vanilla flavor conjures marshmallows in your palate's imagination, bringing this Cream 
Cheese Spread fully into the Hot Cocoa flavor realm!

Bagels are always a top cream-cheese complement, and this instance is no exception. We might add that the 
Hot Cocoa flavor is especially nice smeared on freshly baked Trader Joe's Mini Croissants [sku 65467]. Try 
spreading some on a TJ's Cinnamon Graham Cracker [sku 43871] that you top with a TJ's Dark Chocolate 
Covered Marshmallow [sku 98413]. For a different spin, put some on slices of your favorite TJ's apple, bringing 
the taste of tart-sweet fruit to the Hot-Cocoa-Cream-Cheese table!

"""Ricotta"" is an old Italian word literally meaning ""recooked"" which is a tell-tale, practical naming, telling you 
exactly how this fluffy, sweet cheese is produced. Cheesemakers simply take the whey left from whipping up 
batches of other types of cheese, drizzle in whole milk, an acid of some sort (in our case, acetic acid), and begin 
cooking the whey mixture. This causes curds to coagulate, grow, and solidify. Finally, the curds are strained of 
the remaining whey and you're left with freshly made, fluffy, white Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese.

The aforementioned process is the ""traditional"" way (or should we say whey) of making ricotta, and as we're 
never one to shy away from culinary tradition, Trader Joe's Ricotta Cheese follows this authentic tradition 
to bring our shoppers a classically Italian cheese able to find its way into tons of recipes! An ideal cheese for 
lasagna, baked pastas, stuffed shells, and of course dessert recipes such as cannolis and cheese blintzes. In 
addition to all these mealtime options, our Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese is high in calcium and, for a cheese, 
light in fat and high in protein.

"Wine and cheese go together like bread and butter-for some, they're effectively inseperable. And in our latest 
Spotlight Cheese, they go together so well that they're actually quite literally inseperable! A treasured tradition 
of the Treviso region of Italy, Trader Joe's Ubriaco al Cabernet is made by taking wheels of delicately sweet 
and creamy cheese, poking them all over with a series of holes, then aging them in a mixture of dry Cabernet 
wine and grape marc (the mashed grape skins that are left over during the winemaking process) for at least 
eight months. As the cheese ages and develops a robust flavor and firm texture, the holes in the cheese soak in 
the wine and mashed grape juices, turning the rind a rich, burgundy red.

This process, playfully referred to as ""inebriating"" the cheese (Ubriaco itself is Italian for ""drunk"" or ""tipsy"") 
also infuses the entire wheel with persistently ripe, fruity, and lightly spicy Cabernet notes, giving every bite an 
expansive suite of flavors that's a bit like enjoying a fine wine and fine cheese at the same time. That makes it an 
especially apt choice for inclusion in all kinds of charcuteries and cheese plates, especially when paired with a 
bottle of your favorite dry red wine. We recommend pairing like with like: while supplies last, try it with a glass 
of Cocobon Cabernet [sku 71768] or the latest Trader Joe's Reserve Cab.

"We like toying with Toscano, the robust cheese that combines the nutty characteristics of an aged Parmesan 
with the creaminess of a farmstead Cheddar. We've featured iterations soaked in Syrah wine, crusted with 
black pepper, and dusted with cinnamon! Our latest Toscano tweak again involves wine. Trader Joe's Creamy 
Toscano Cheese Soaked in Chardonnay Wine starts with wheels of that same nutty, creamy cheese, crafted 
for us in Wisconsin. It's made from the freshest milk sourced from local, family-owned farms, and it's certified 
to come from cows never treated with rBST hormones. Each wheel is patiently soaked by hand in a bright and 
buttery Chardonnay. The classic character of the wine - hints of sweet citrus with oak-barrel notes - creates a 
savory masterpiece when partnered with the Toscano. 

It's irresistible with or without an actual glass of Chardonnay. And the price for such a uniquely crafted cheese 
is pretty irresistible, too. We're selling Trader Joe's Creamy Toscano Cheese Soaked in Chardonnay Wine 
for $9.99 per pound. You'll find random-weight pieces, around half a pound each, chillin' in our cheese case.

"Trader Jacques double crème brie with truffles is a decadent cheese made with real French 
truffles. This cheese is made by a family-owned cheese manufacturer in the village of 
Pelussin in the heart of the Rhone-Alps region of France where the world famous Cotes du 
Rhone wine production occurs. The cheese is made using technology called ultrafiltration, a 
process that removes the water from 
pasteurized milk, concentrating the 
nutrients, proteins and fat; delivering a 
truly creamy and delicious cheese.  
 
Truffles are a sought after delicacy that 
impart complex flavors to food. Our 
truffle brie is made with actual bonafide 
truffle shavings, not the truffle oil or 
extract found in other ""truffle-flavored"" 
cheeses. This recipe delivers a rich and 
authentic truffle flavor, soft and smooth 
texture and a pleasant earthy finish. The 
creamy, buttery cheese provides a rich 
back drop for the earthy, slightly salty 
truffle flavor. Our tasting panel went 
through many versions of this cheese to

"A holiday tradition dating back all the way to 17th century England, Sage Derby is well beloved in Britain 
for its savory, herbaceous taste, firm, buttery texture, and unmistakable green hue. Trader Joe's Sage Derby 
(pronounced DAR-bee, across the pond) is crafted especially for us by a small, family-owned cheesemaker in 
Lancashire, who hand-blends the Cheddar curds with a mix of earthy, aromatic sage and spinach (for color). 
Each wedge has a marvelously marbled, and-if we dare say so ourselves-charmingly festive appearance, 
ideal for serving on cheese plates of all kinds.

So how best to enjoy Sage Derby? Aside from simply eating it on its own or with a glass of crisp Chardonnay 
(which we certainly won't dissuade you from), it also makes an excellent ingredient in cheese scones, quiches, 
or potatoes au gratin. For aesthetically-minded foodies, it provides some nicely verdant visuals when cubed 
and served alongside charcuterie or melted into mac & cheese. And if you're ready for some exceptionally sage 
advice, we find its awesomely herbaceous qualities make it a perfect cheese for slicing thin and serving on a 
roast turkey sandwich. Mmm!

"Sometimes, to make something truly great, you've got to do it by hand. Just ask the suppliers behind Trader 
Joe's Rutland Red Leicester Cheese, the newest addition to our Spotlight Cheese lineup. Based out of the 
county of Leicestershire   (pronounced ""LEH-ster-sher"") in the United Kingdom, these expert cheesemakers 
prepare each batch of this Leicester red by hand-coating the blocks of cheese in butter, then hand-wrapping 
them in cloth before maturing them. As the cheese ages, the butter keeps it moist, and the cloth seals in the 
butter, resulting in a super crumbly texture that simply melts in your mouth. 

From its striking red-orange hue (a result of added annato, the same natural dye used to give Cheddar its 
signature yellow color) to its mild, caramel-y flavor and remarkably flaky texture, Rutland Red is unique, 
delicious, and versatile. It adds visual flair and savory sophistication to any charcuterie board, brings a delightful 
something extra to mashed potatoes or omelettes, and pairs wonderfully with a crisp, full-bodied white wine. 
And since it's a TJ's Spotlight Cheese, it's a real value, too: while supplies last, you can find random-weight 
pieces of Trader Joe's Rutland Red for $9.99* per pound. Look for them in our cheese section.

"We'd like to introduce you to Stripey Joe, a marvelously multi-hued English cheese, new to our cheese case. 
Actually, if we're being entirely accurate, Trader Joe's Stripey Joe is four English cheeses, luxuriously layered 
on top of one another to create a Stripey masterpiece. Crafted for us by a small, family-owned creamery 
in Northwest England, this savory supergroup is made with Cheshire, Cheddar, Double Gloucester and Red 
Leicester, arranged in alternating layers of yellow, orange, and white. Each bite will take your taste buds on a 
tour of the English countryside, where you'll savor some of the most celebrated cheeses from across Britain.

Individually, each of Joe's stripes is creamy, salty, and sharp in its own, unique way. When eaten all together, 
those subtle differences compose a kind of culinary harmony suited for melting over burgers, grating over 
a salad, or simply enjoying on its own, paired with a frosty glass of your favorite ale. And when it comes to 
providing some visual flair to a charcuterie board or cocktail party cheese plate, believe us: this cheese has more 
than earned its stripes.

"One of our favorite things about finely crafted cheese - and believe us, our list of favorite things about finely 
crafted cheeses is a long one - is how ably they act as a canvas for other flavors and sensations. Take Trader Joe's 
Triple Cream Brie Cheese with Green Peppercorns, for instance. Buttery, soft-ripened Triple Cream Brie is a 
delight on all its own, but by adding in the piquant pop of Green Peppercorns (i.e., black peppercorns before 
they're blanched and dried), our supplier, an expert cheesemaker based in Germany, has created something 
entirely unique: a cheese that's rich, creamy, zesty, and even just a touch spicy, all at once. 

Ideal for cheeseboards and charcuterie plates, great on a grilled cheese or patty melt, and a wonder when 
simply enjoyed out of the fridge, this plush-yet-peppery Brie is truly something to behold. Try melting it 
over a flatbread with prosciutto and chopped figs for an elevated appetizer, or stuffing into a flattened chicken 
cutlet before breading and pan-frying for a first-rate cordon bleu. We find that its full flavor and delicate spice 
combine especially well with sweeter flavors: try pairing it with sliced pears, a drizzle of honey, or a dollop of 
your favorite fruit preserves.

"Hailing from the Lombardy region of Italy just southwest of Milan, the Mascarpone story begins. While we got 
plenty of positives from Italy during the Renaissance, this fresh, cream cheese offering may be one of the best 
thing that came out of the turn from 16th to 17th century. 

Unlike many of the other cheeses you'll find in our refrigerators, Mascarpone is a pasteurized milk and cream 
cheese that is coagulated from the use of an acidic substances (in this case we use citric acid, but historically 
lemon juice and vinegar have been used). After the curdling, the whey is removed without pressing or aging 
resulting in a thick crème fraîche-like cheese with a fat content upwards of 60%+. 

The final product is that of a smooth, thickened cream not far from the texture of whipped butter. This light 
texture continues with a mildly flavored, milky flavored cheese that is so mellow in flavor it can lend itself to 
both sweet and savory dishes. Mascarpone is used in tons of northern Italian dishes and desserts because the 
original flavor goes well with anything from mustard and spices to sweet cocoa and coffee. Grab a tub today 
and take your culinary travels to Italy with a Mascarpone recipe!

"Green goddess began as a salad dressing. Wait, back up. As the story goes, a hotel chef in San Francisco (circa 
1923) wanted to pay tribute to his actor friend who was appearing in a play by William Archer called ""The 
Green Goddess."" He concocted a creamy, green-tinted dressing that was to be the inspiration for many dressings 
to come.

Of course, Trader Joe's picked up on this with our Green Goddess Dressing [sku 59991] and extended that line 
into the dip category with our Green Goddess Dip [sku 65623]. Then we wanted to stretch the concept a bit, so 
we partnered with a cheese maker in New York to create a cheese that would be exclusive to Trader Joe's and 
would include a distinct, green-herby character that could justify its name: Green Goddess Gouda.

This Gouda is actually a blend of two goudas; one milder, and one that's aged and a bit sharper. The smooth, 
flavorful cheese base is blended with a pesto (created separately) that includes olive oil, avocado oil, onion 
powder-and several dried alliums and herbs, such as minced garlic, scallions, chives, basil, and parsley. The 
result is a herbalicious, smooth & nutty cheese that very tasty on its own. It also melts quite well, so you can put 
our Green Goddess Gouda on your panini, your burger, or even in your mac and cheese!

"What's in a name, you ask? For cheese, a name can mean quite a lot. For instance, the name of Trader Joe's 
Chiave D'Oro, a returning favorite to our Spotlight Cheese program, translates from Italian to ""golden key."" 
It's crafted for us by an acclaimed supplier from California, who named it for its rich, golden color, and for the 
fact that its uniquely nutty and delicately sweet flavor profile can only be ""unlocked,"" as it were, by a series of 
secret, proprietary cheesemaking techniques. Perhaps, by any other name, this Chiave D'Oro would taste just 
as nutty and sweet-but it wouldn't be quite as poetic, now, would it?

Made with raw milk and aged a minimum of 6 months, Chiave D'Oro has a firm, toothsome texture and 
balanced flavor that's a bit like a Parmesan mixed with a Gouda. In addition to being an excellent standalone 
snacking cheese, it makes an extraordinary addition to any cheese plate or charcuterie board, and it's especially 
delicious when grated and served over salads, soups, or roasted veggies. Looking to pair with a wine? Something 
big and bold will be key (if you pardon the pun). We reccommend a glass of Trading Post by Trader Joe's Napa 
Valley Cabernet [sku 78466].

"Trader Joe's sells lots of cheese. We have since our inception. The bulk of our cheese selections derive from cow's 
milk, but we do carry a considerable variety of goat's milk cheeses (or chèvre, in French)-around 15, at last 
count. Add one more, seasonally, to our list: Trader Joe's Jalapeño and Honey Chevre Goat's Milk Cheese.

From an American cheese maker known for chèvre comes this uniquely flavored log, made exclusively for Trad-
er Joe's. Although we've seen other goat cheeses with jalapeños before, and though we currently carry a popular 
Chevre with Honey [sku 98592], we've never seen these two flavors put together in one goat cheese. 

Our Jalapeño and Honey Chevre presents spicy heat from real jalapeños, combined with the sweetness of real 
honey. These flavors are blended into fresh cheese made from pasteurized goat's milk collected from a network 
of independent family farms in the U.S. Made in the French tradition, goat's milk is first curdled, then slowly 
drained, and finally folded with the peppers and honey, ensuring real depth of flavor and a smooth texture.

Trader Joe's Jalapeño Honey Chevre was, at one point, our featured August Spotlight, but it was so good we've 
decided to bring it back seasonally, for the summer. Each five ounce log is $2.99. Find it in our cheese case with

"Provolone Cheese is an age-old Italian creation that brings a mildly creamy flavor to plenty of dishes. Trader 
Joe's Sliced Provolone Cheese makes this exemplar cheese variety available in a pre-sliced form ready to enjoy 
atop sandwiches, wraps,  and other cold cut classics a plenty. 

A cousin of mozzarella, Provolone Cheese is a cow's milk, semi-hard formaggi a pasta filata (Italian for ""spun 
paste cheese""). It undergoes kneading of the fresh curd in hot water to give that famously elastic, rubbery 
texture that Provolone Cheese is known for. This mass of curd created from the stretching process is then aged 
to harden, and therefore differentiate, the Provolone from its mozzarella cousin. Like all pulled curd cheeses, 
a bit of Sliced Provolone Cheese is wonderful, and arguably more flavorful, when melted. This should direct 
your mind to the world of paninis, casseroles, baked pasta, and hoagies as a perfect pairing for our Sliced 
Provolone Cheese. Each slice was made for two slices of fresh bread, to be flashed in heat, and to evoke images

"Could you crumble goat cheese yourself? Absolutely. But why would you want to when we've done the

"In a recent Trader Joe's tasting panel, we became absolutely enamored by an outstanding summer 
flavor duo: Chive and Cheddar Cheese. Early in the cheese-making process, fragrant Chives are hand-
rubbed on wheels of Irish-style Cheddar Cheese, marrying its semi-firm texture with the delicate allium flavor 
and verdant hue of the fresh herb. It's aged a minimum of four months to create the palate-pleasing partnership 
of creamy, sharp Cheddar and sweet, earthy Chives that truly made our panelists believe in love at first bite. 

An altogether fantastic fromage on its own, Trader Joe's Chive Cheddar Cheese also imparts an herbal, savory 
interest to a myriad of culinary matches. Try it melted with elbow macaroni or on a grilled cheese sandwich, 
or showcase it on a summer cheese board alongside a handful of Everything But the Bagel Bite Sized Crackers 
[sku 94599]. Next time you fire up the grill, melt a slice over your burger for an awesome allium addition. Why 
not bake up an appetizing alliance of Organic Deglet Noor Dates [sku 70907] stuffed with cubes of this herbal 
Cheddar? (Warning: it's impossible to eat just one.)

"When it comes to finding excellent cheeses at astounding prices, you don't need to search over the rainbow-simply 
seek out the cheese case at your neighborhood Trader Joe's. In addition to our incredible everyday offerings, we 
shine a spotlight every month on unique cheeses from all corners of the earth-cheeses with interesting stories and 
irresistible flavors, like Dorothy's Comeback Cow Soft Ripened Cheese. 

In 1925, Dorothy Demeter's father Fred launched the company that would eventually come to be known as Dorothy's 
Creamery. Dorothy worked in the Lena, IL plant, and as she grew to become a cheesemaking pioneer in her own 
right, she was known to work tirelessly or, as they say, until the cows came home, perfecting her soft-ripened cheeses. 
One such soft ripened cheese with a velvety mouthfeel, slightly sweet, buttery flavor and earthy aroma, Dorothy's 
Comeback Cow can be identified by its characteristic bloomy orange rind and its unique shape. Each wheel of 
Dorothy's Comeback Cow is molded into the shape of a flower, a nod to the wild grasses and flowers the cows feed 
on to produce the flavorful milk that goes into this silky Soft Ripened Cheese-milk which is also r-BST-free!

There's no denying that a cheese of this particular pedigree is a standout option on a cheese board, with TJ's Truffle 
Marcona Almonds [sku 54048], tangy Cornichons [sku 00616], and a glass of Cabernet. It's equally excellent in a 
panini with thinly sliced green apple, a handful of peppery arugula, and a crisp glass of La Burgondie Cremant de 
Bourgogne [sku 58288]. Or you could bake it in the oven, drizzle generously with Mostly Mesquite Honey [sku 01534], 
and dip with crisp crackers until the cows come home...

We're offering 7-ounce packages of Dorothy's Comeback Cow Soft Ripened Cheese for $6.99, only during the 
month of May. Find it by following the road-er, the aisles, to our cheese case.

"Each New Year arrives with the promise of being distinctive and unlike any other year that's come before. This 
annual anticipation-the feeling that something special (and good) is just around the corner-is one of the 
reasons we've chosen Trader Joe's Caramel Washed Gouda as our January Spotlight. From its inception to 
it's aging, this unique cheese is an edible analog for those one-of-a-kind experiences that will define the year 
ahead.

Like all of Trader Joe's cheeses, our Caramel Washed Gouda begins with milk that comes from cows that 
have never been treated with rBST hormones. But that's not the only way these cows are coddled. Their 
farmer-who oversees an idyllic estate in the picturesque Twente region of The Netherlands-gives his 
bovines carte blanche to roam, from clean stable to clover-laden fields. Happy cows supply marvelous milk, 
which yields exceptional cheese. Of course, the farmer's authentic recipe and artisanal methods don't hurt, 
either.

We could stop at great Gouda, but there's more¿ The fresh-made cheese is hand-washed in caramel (yes, 
caramel!). As it matures over the next five months, the rind develops an appealing, chestnut-brown color. On 
the inside, the aging curds absorb some of the caramel, producing a mildly sweet flavor.

It's hard for us to think of a better cheese to kick-off a brand new year than this Caramel Washed Gouda. 
You'll consider $9.99 per pound a true value, especially after you see and taste this creamy, mildly sweet, 
distinctive cheese. Let it be the taste of good things to come!

"What happens when you marry old world cultures and cave-aged technique with quality milk production 
in the Green Mountains of Vermont? The cheese mongers at Jasper Hill did exactly that, and came up with 
Vault No. 5 Cave Aged Cheese. Toasty and aromatic, Vault No. 5 was inspired by Swiss and Italian mountain 
cheeses-delightfully creamy, toasty and savory, with subtle earthy notes. It's cave aged for a minimum of one 
year, a process that allows a natural rind to form around its golden, straw colored paste. In short, it's the stuff 
cheesy dreams are made of.

Let this Cave Aged Cheese warm to room temperature, and you'll be rewarded as its dense, pliant texture 
gives way to an ultra-buttery mouthfeel with each bite. If you manage not to eat all of it right off the cheese 
board-and we wouldn't blame you if you did-try it melted on a grilled cheese sandwich or burger. It'd be 
right at home paired with a glass of Satis Dei Syrah Garnacha [sku 642149], or Drive Thru Red Dry Hopped Red 
Ale [sku 61149].

"We've heard mumbling that our Fresh Mozzarella is ""magical"" from the moment we introduced it in our 
stores, way back in 1995. While we cannot officially ascribe it this designation (the FDA has yet to rule on what 
foods may be dubbed ""magical,"" you see), we do see what folks are getting at-Trader Joe's All Natural Fresh 
Mozzarella really is the perfect ball of Mozzarella Cheese. It's moist, mild, and milky-fresh, with that perfect-
for-melting, almost ""bouncy"" mozzarella texture. It's also made from the milk of cows never treated with rBST, 
so you can feel fantastic about adding it to everything from pizzas & pastas to salads & hors d'oeuvres. 

Another thing to feel good about: each Trader Joe's Fresh Mozzarella Cheese ""ball"" (mind the quotes, as it's

"How do I love thee?  Let me count the shreds. ~Joe Shakespeare

Trader Joe's Fancy* Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend is our ideal blend for dishes with a Mexican flair, with 
sharp Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Asadero and Queso Blanco cheeses. It's a blend that's unique to Trader Joe's, 
and it boasts a unique flavor profile. The Jack, Asadero and Queso Blanco are mild, while the sharp Cheddar 
adds a bit of a bite. 

All of the cheeses are well-known for their meltability, which makes them particularly well-suited to dishes 
like burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas and tacos. And don't let the name make you feel like you need to limit 
yourself to Mexican dishes. This blend is excellent in salads and atop soups, and makes a distinctively flavored 
grilled cheese sandwich.

We're selling each 12-ounce, resealable package of Trader Joe's Fancy Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend for 
$3.49, a price that's not fancy at all.

"Here to add some heat to sandwiches, charcuterie boards, or homemade mac and cheese, Trader Joe's Spicy 
Buffalo Cheddar combines the savory splendor of a classic Cheddar with the satisfying spice of buffalo wing 
sauce. It's crafted for us by a specialty cheesemaker in upstate New York (just a little ways away from the city of 
Buffalo, itself), who mixes their Cheddar with hot sauce and bits of jalapeño, habanero, and dried red pepper 
flakes, providing a piping hot pop of flavor in every bite. Hot enough for all the heat-seekers out there, but not 
so blazing as to turn away any casual fans of capsaicin, our Spicy Buffalo Cheddar is a fun, fiery cheese with 
practically endless uses.

Try melting a slice of Buffalo Cheddar on a smash burger, or shredding it and serving it over hard shell tacos 
for some extra spice. It adds peppery pinache when incorporated into salads, soups, or baked potatoes, and 
pairs beautifully with spicy cuts of Calabrese salami or pepperoni. Just don't let our inventory burn out before 
you get a chance to try it, because supplies are limited, and a deal this red-hot won't last for long!

"Given our fondness for food mashups, you might assume that Trader Joe's Garlic Bread Cheese is a garlic 
bread cheese-as in, a cheese flavored like the popular side dish for pizzas and pastas. But the truth is, it's 
actually a garlic bread cheese, inspired by the Finnish delicacy that just happens, by idiomatic coincidence, to 
pair wonderfully with garlic. It's crafted for us by master cheesemakers in Wisconsin, who take blocks of rich, 
thick, cow's milk cheese, cover them in garlic powder, then bake them to a beautifully golden brown hue.

Known in its native Finland as juustolepä, Bread Cheese contains no wheat, or gluten, nor anything else of that 
nature, but rather gets its name from its hearty, remarkably bread-like consistency and squeaky, Halloumi-like 
texture. And much like Halloumi, Trader Joe's Garlic Bread Cheese is best served nice and warm, after it's 
had a chance to get just a little melty and gooey. Fun fact: in Finland, Bread Cheese is typically eaten in the 
morning, dunked in coffee. We find that the bold and savory notes of garlic in this Bread Cheese are better 
suited for a bit of Organic Marinara Sauce [sku 09976], ourselves.

"A little earlier this year, we introduced Trader Joe's Garlic Bread Cheese [sku 71622] to our stores. Inspired by 
the Finnish specialty juustolepä, this garlic-seasoned, squeaky-textured, baked cheese gained quite a following 
during its limited run, particularly for its ability to become gooey and stretchy-but not quite melt entirely-
when heated. Trader Joe's Pizza Bread Cheese, our fabulously flavorful follow-up, keeps that same texture and 
gooey-when-heated quality, but ups the ante in the flavoring department, by way of a panoply of zesty pizza 
seasonings, inlcuding oregano, basil, fennel, and even bits of dried tomato flakes.

Like our previous iteration, this Bread Cheese contains no wheat, gluten, or other bread-y ingredients-the 
""bread"" refers to the consistency of the cheese, rather than its actual makeup. Best enjoyed warm, after a quick 
searing in a skillet or even a minute or so in the microwave, each bite is a bit like eating a fresh, hot-from-the-
oven slice of margherita pizza-but without the crust. Try it as appetizer or snack, paired with a ramekin of 
warm Organic Marinara [sku 09976] for dipping.

"Imagine finding an antique wooden spoon with some writing on the back of it. Upon closer examination, you 
find this flat, wide, spoon to have small drain holes. It's a very old cream skimmer. Then, you realize that the 
message on the back is actually a recipe-step-by-step directions for making farmhouse cheese, exactly the way 
it was done by an anonymous dairy farmer who lived years ago in the Eastern Italian Alps.

If you were to follow that recipe (like we did!) you would end up with our Formaggio Lagorai (La-gor-EYE). 
This is a traditional cheese made for us in the Lagorai mountains of Trentino, Italy... from an actual recipe 
found on the back of a spoon. The milk comes from cows that feast on pristine Alpine grasses. Their fresh 
milk is shipped daily to skilled dairy artisans, who filter and chill it (to maintain it's natural characteristics) 
and then process it-following the recipe, exactly as it appears on the back of that old skimmer. The curd is 
ripened on pinewood shelves in a cool, damp space. Once a week for two months, it is washed and turned until 
it has matured. The finished cheese has a delicate, semi-soft texture. It exudes the subtle aromas of herbs and 
mountain flowers, delivering a mild and pleasant taste.

The ""cheese of the unknown farmer,"" called Formaggio Lagorai, is the kind of heirloom item we are proud to 
feature and pleased to offer everyday at the remarkable price of $8.99 per pound. Cut size varies.

"When our customers talk, we listen. And organic cheeses have been on our customers' minds. Based on the 
continued success of crumbled cheeses in our stores, our Product Developer was happy to oblige customer 
requests, while at the same time creating a first-of-its-kind product (on our cheese shelves, at least). Please 
welcome Trader Joe's Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese!  

While traditional feta is made with sheep's milk, our Organic Crumbled Feta is made in Wisconsin with 
organic, rBST-free cow's milk. The cow's milk offers a milder flavor than sheep's milk, while retaining the 
pleasant tanginess so favored by feta fans. The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as ""pickling"" but 
with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process 
creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made 
with organic milk? Be still our palates! 

Although a handful of Crumbled Feta atop a crisp romaine salad is a wonderful thing, there's an endless 
number of ways to enjoy its salty goodness outside of leafy greens. Stir it into rigatoni with sausage, white beans, 
and kale. Mix it with TJ's Fresh Bruschetta Sauce [sku 07904] and Steamed Lentils [sku 90240] for a quick cracker 
dip. Or, gently warm some Giant Chalkidiki Olives [sku 57608] in olive oil with chili flakes and lemon peel, 
then pour the mixture over a shallow bowl of Organic Crumbled Feta Cheese, and serve with crusty bread for 
dipping. At $3.49 for six ounces, you may want to grab more than one tub to explore all the possibilities! Find

"One of our favorite things about truffle is just how wonderfully its savory flavors and intense aromas interact 
with other flavors and sensations, Take something like Burrata, for example. Already a superbly sumptuous 
eating experience in its own right, the silky-soft, fresh mozzarella exterior and sweet, delicately creamy interior 
of Burrata acts as a perfect foil to the earthy notes of black truffle, creating a uniquely delicious interplay of 
taste and texture  - and one that you can savor in every bite of Trader Joe's Truffle Buratta.

Made for us by an expert cheesemaker in Wisconsin, this Truffle Burrata uses the contrasts of its constituent 
ingredients to great effect, with each opposing aspect accentuating the other. The fresh mozzarella's soft 
chewiness heightens the richness of the cream inside, which in turn is enhanced by the umami notes of the 
black summer truffle mixed within. It makes an excellent appetizer or side dish, especially when served with 
pasta or pizza, and even tastes amazing when melted directly onto of a wood-fired pizza, itself. For an even 
more thrilling mix of flavor and texture, try it on top of a crisp, simple salad, drizzled with just a touch of olive 
oil and balsamic vinegar.

"One of only twelve Swiss cheeses with an official Appellation d'Origine Protegèe (""protected designation of 
origin""), Tête de Moine is a cheese with an 800-year-old recipe. It's crafted with part-skim cow's milk, the fresh 
product of eight village creameries in the Swiss region of origin. Once made, the petite, cylindrical wheels of 
cheese are matured on spruce wood boards for at least two-and-a-half months. Now, here's where it gets really 
interesting: Each wheel is centered on a steel post so it may rotate while a very sharp cutting tool is dragged 
along the surface of the cheese. The result is super-thin and long slices that naturally curl as they are cut, 
forming what resembles a delicate rose.

In addition to the intriguing look of these Rosettes, the increased surface area that comes in contact with 
the air changes the structure of the cheese, allowing its aromatic character to develop to the fullest. When 
popped in your mouth, the silky, ivory-colored, flower-shaped Cheese literally melts, creating a cheese-eating 
experience like no other!

"No need to be sheepish about it: we love a good sheep's milk cheese, and pecorino happens to be one of the 
finest sheep's milk cheeses in the flock. Mild and nutty, with a firm, lightly aged texture, pecorino pairs perfectly 
with big flavors like sweet preserves, salty cured cold cuts, and as this cheese ably demonstrates, super savory 
truffles. Please join us in giving a warm, welcoming boungiorno to Trader Joe's Truffle Pecorino!

Made for us by an expert Italian cheesemaker, our Truffle Pecorino's bold combination of lightly tangy, slightly 
briny cheese and intense, umami-forward truffle lends it a remarkable degree of versatility. You can shave it 
and serve it over soups and salads, grate it and incorporate it into a particularly decadent cacio e pepe pasta, 
give it a showstopping turn on your charcuterie board, or simply enjoy it out of the fridge as a snack. However 
you enjoy it, be warned: this rich, truffle-y cheese will be herded away once the holidays are done. Until then, 
you can find it in our cheese section.

"Trader Joe's Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese begs the question¿ is it cheese, or is it dessert? Of course, 
cheese can be dessert, but Lemon Ricotta represents a blurry line. You see, if you closed your eyes and 
took a bite, you may well think you're biting into lemon cheesecake. Not that there's anything wrong with 
that.

Made for us in Southern Italy, Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese starts with fresh milk, salt, and whey. The 
resulting curd is blended with lemon cream (a mix of lemons and sugar), then placed into a circular mold 
and baked at low temperatures. When it emerges from the oven and cools, it does in fact look like dessert. 
And you can serve it for dessert. The winning part of this proposition, though, is that you can also serve 
it on a cheese platter before dinner¿ and no one will look askance. Serve this sweet, tangy cheese with 
crackers, on baguette slices, or with fresh fruit. And here's a fresh idea¿ mix it into hot pasta for a creamy, 
lemony ""sauce"" that will leave your dinner guests pining for seconds.

Trader Joe's Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese is only around for the holiday season, and only as long as we 
can keep it in stock. We're selling it for the terrific price of $10.99 a pound, only at your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's.

"There are many benefits to aging: better knowledge of oneself, accumulated wisdom, and a distinctive nuttiness. 
That last quality especially applies to aged cheese! And we have a very special aged cheese for the holidays...

We regularly sell shaved, grated, and cut pieces of authentic Parmesan Reggiano, which is typically aged 24 
months or more. What makes this particular Parmigiano so special is that it's aged 40 Months. Yes, that's 
3 years and 4 months! And yes, it is distinctively nutty, with a full and fruity aroma, intense notes of melted 
butter, and a wonderfully crumbly texture that only comes with such age. 

It's made in the Parma-Reggio Emilia region (official P.D.O.), with strict adherence to traditions handed down 
over nearly one-thousand years-from the production of the milk, through the entire cheese-making process. 
Just three ingredients are used: the highest quality raw cow's milk, animal rennet, and salt. We suppose you 
might consider 'knowledge' a fourth ingredient-the knowledge applied to making and inspecting each wheel 
of Parmigiano as it matures over time. Only the best wheels are chosen to go the 40-month distance, and this 
Trader Joe's cheese certainly makes the cut!

"We've been offering a Cranberry Chevre in our cheese case for many years. It was the first of our fruit-enhanced 
goat cheese offerings, and if you've visited over time, you'll know that its impact on our approach to goat cheese 
was (and remains) profound! In the intervening years, we've introduced a number of fruit-partnered options-
and while we truly love them all, the Cranberry Chevre will always have a special place on our palates. 

Fresh goat cheese is formed into a log shape, then rolled in a mixture of sweetened, dried cranberries. It's 
that simple. Don't let the simplicity fool you-the tart tang of the cheese, combined with the sweet tart of the 
berries, produces a revelation of flavors. Creamy inside and just a bit chewy around the edges, this cheese is

"Raclette is a classic melting cheese 
perfect for the fall and winter months. It 
is a mountain cheese that has a nutty 
flavor and a silky, smooth texture. The 
word raclette refers to both the famous 
type of cheese as well as the dish. 
Younger and a bit softer than most other 
alpine cheeses, raclette is delicious 
melted over potatoes, cornichons and 
vegetables. It's also great to scoop up 
with bread. Raclette is easy to prepare 
using the simplest of ingredients and has 
long been a favorite for festive and fun 
interactive evenings. Because it's mostly 
used for cooking, we thought converting 
this product from a cut and wrap wedge 
into a sliced format made it easier and

"Sardinian Sheep's Milk Cheese has a magical ring to it. Not surprisingly, the magic continues far beyond the 
title of this September Spotlight!

Trader Joe's Canestrato Pepato is made for us in Italy-Sardinia, to be exact. There, an award-winning 
cheesemaker combines century-old practices with a modern production facility to craft this cheese. It's made 
with pasteurized sheep's milk, animal rennet, salt, and proprietary cheese cultures. The inclusion of peppercorns 
adds even more distinction, and a mild kick.

Canestrato Pepato's pleasantly piquant profile with its peppery notes, occasionally crunchy texture, and 
underlying rich, nutty flavor, is delightful when enjoyed with a pale ale. And if you're making your own Cacio 
e Pepe pasta dish at home, the creamy-pepper character of this cheese will make it magical, indeed!

"Famed for their importance in Caribbean cuisine, and named for their physical resemblance to a woolen tam 
o' shanter cap, Scotch bonnet chilis have a delicate sweetness to them and a remarkable level of heat - a few 
orders of magnitude hotter than jalapeños, for reference. And as the makers of Trader Joe's Cheddar with 
Scotch Bonnet Chilis and Red Peppers have found, these qualities make them a natural companion to the 
inherent nuttiness and crumbly texture of a classic English Cheddar. Using a mix of time-tested cheesemaking 
techniques and state of the art equipment, they flavor this savory Cheddar with sweet and fiery Scotch bonnet 
chili relish to great acclaim in supermarkets across the U.K. - and we're proud to say that we're the first to carry 
it across the pond.

A delight for heat-seekers and fromage fans of all stripes, this Cheddar balances its blend of sweet, spicy, and 
creamy with remarkable grace. It makes a great addition to grilled cheese sandwiches, mac & cheese casseroles, 
or even a sweet and hot potatoes au gratin. Looking to turn up the heat at your next get-together? Pair this 
Cheddar up with spicy cold cuts like pepperoni and capicola for a scorching charcuterie plate - just make sure 
to take the cheese out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving for maximum flavor.

"When you set out to create a vegan version of cream cheese, you better be sure that you're getting the ""cream"" 
part right. Luckily, with Trader Joe's Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative, that's exactly what we've done. Made 
from an ingeniously balanced base of coconut oil mixed with potato starch and chickpea protein, this Vegan 
Cream Cheese has all the smooth spreadability and silky mouth feel of a standard, dairy-based cream cheese, 
but non of the dairy - or any other animal-based products, for that matter.

Since this Cream Cheese Alternative so perfectly sticks the landing, creaminess-wise, it opens up all kinds of 
avenues for use: from the simple pleasure of a breakfast bagel, lovingly smeared with Vegan Cream Cheese 
and topped with sliced red onion and capers, to vegan stuffed manicotti or jalapeño poppers, the sky's the limit. 
And that's before we get to its boundless baking opportunities: the creamy center of a vegan danish, the swirl in 
a pan of vegan brownies, or the frosting of a vegan red velvet or carrot cake aren't just possible, they're now all 
as simple as grabbing a tub of Trader Joe's Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative from your neighborhood Trader 
Joe's cheese section.

"Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar looks like an aged Cheddar. At first bite, it tastes like an aged Cheddar.  And 
then something entirely unexpected happens. The smooth creaminess of the Cheddar gives way to a tangy 
flavor and slightly crumbly texture, a subtle hint of salt crystallization is discovered, and it begins to taste like 
an aged Parmesan. Unexpected indeed!  

Our cheese makers, based in Wisconsin, have origins in Valdastico, in Italy's mountainous, Northeastern 
Veneto region. In this cheese, they've combined the best qualities of hard Italian cheeses like Parmesan with the 
best qualities of finely crafted American Cheddar and created a semi-hard cheese that pairs well with lighter-
bodied red wines (think Pinot Noir) or pale ales. Joined by crusty bread, a slice of your favorite salami, and Fig 
& Olive Crisps [sku 53273], this cheese is unexpectedly perfect.  
 
As with most cheeses, we suggest letting Unexpected Cheddar breathe at room temperature for about 30 
minutes prior to serving. If you're prepping a platter, unwrap the cheese and resist the temptation to cut right in. 
Your patience will be rewarded with cheese that really lives up to its flavor potential. It really is worth the wait.
 
Anywhere else, its price of $3.99 for each seven ounce piece of this exquisite cheese would be an unexpected 
value.

"While in England visiting a farm, famous for their flavored cheese artistry, we were introduced to this Cheddar 
Cheese with Caramelized Onions. It's crafted for us on an established estate, idyllically situated between the 
rolling Dorset Downs and the Jurassic Coast-an international world heritage site, lush with pastures. With 
more than 40 years of traditional cheese making experience, a famed farm on this estate transforms rich, 
creamy milk from local grazing herds (within a 30 mile radius) into beautiful, full-bodied farmhouse Cheddar. 
Inspired by a classically British ploughman's lunch pairing (cheese & chutney), these blending artists mix 
caramelized onion marmalade into the Cheddar, giving it a balanced sweet-savory bite and pleasing onion 
aroma. It's firm, creamy and adorned throughout with bits of onion. It's memorable!  

Trader Joe's Cheddar Cheese with Caramelized Onions is excellent served simply-cut and accompanied 
by crackers or small slices of rustic bread. It also melts exceptionally well, which makes it a fun topping for 
burgers, grilled cheeses or pizzas. We also enjoy the sweetness it brings to cream sauces.

"Certain cheeses can be a real challenge to replicate without the use of dairy, but lucky for all of us, Parmesan is 
definitely not one of those cheeses. Trader Joe's Dairy Free Shredded Parmesan Cheese Alternative is proof! 
Made from a base of highly refined coconut oil, our Parmesan Alternative is packed with all the same salty, nutty, 
and supremely savory notes of traditional, dairy-based Parmesan-but contains only plant-based ingredients. 

That makes it a great option for sprucing up soups, salads, pasta, potatoes, and everything in between. Since it 
was designed with vegans and non-vegans in mind, this plant-based Parmesan Alternative can be used in both 
vegan and non-vegan dishes with equal aplomb. We must admit, though, it does present some especially delicious 
opportunities for vegan recipes: imagine roasted Brussels sprouts sprinkled with savory, vegan Parmesan, or a 
luxuriously creamy salad tossed with our Spicy Cashew Butter Dressing [sku 68423] and topped with these shreds 
for some extra texture. Too good to be true? Hardly - you can find eight-ounce pouches of this Shredded 
Parmesan Alternative in our cheese case, every day.

"Making a cheese board for guests who have a low tolerance for cheese from cow's milk? Looking for that tangy 
flavor that can only be described as ""goaty""? Well, Trader Joe's Chevre Goat Cheese has the perfect little log 
of creamy, fresh goodness for you!

Chevre, French for goat cheese, is made in similar fashion to many cheeses made from cow's milk. The finished 
product, though, delivers a whole new world of flavors, texture, and nutrition profile that works wonders for 
people who prefer to stay away from traditional cheeses or anyone looking to add a slice of adventure to their 
cheese spreads. Trader Joe's Chevre has a uniquely earthy, tangy taste that separates them from their ungulate 
cow-nterparts. This lovely Chevre is fresh, soft, and unaged - lower in fat, calcium, but higher in vitamin A 
than cheese from cow's milk. And with a lower lactose content, makes it more tolerable for many children and 
elderly people who may have a tougher time processing lactose.

"A sprinkling of shredded mozzarella is a sure-fire way to add a nice element of savory flavor and smooth texture 
to all kinds of savory dishes. Like all good things, though, sometimes moderation is called for - sometimes 
you just want a light bit of cheesiness that won't overwhelm your entrée. For times like these, we have Trader 
Joe's Lite Shredded Mozzarella, a handy pouch of pre-shredded mozzarella cheese that contains 60% less fat 
and 25% fewer calories than standard mozzarella. Even with this lower fat content, it has an elegantly firm and 
chewy texture at room temperature, and becomes gloriously gooey when melted.

Delicately buttery in flavor, this Lite Shredded Mozzarella can be subbed in for any application that calls for 
regular mozzarella, like pizzas, patty melts, lasagnas or casseroles. Try it on salads, mixed into scrambled eggs, 
or sprinkled over soups to give your meals a little something more. And of course, since this is Trader Joe's, 
you'll pay a little someting less for each 12-ounce resealable bag.

"Individually, cheese made from goat's milk and cheese made from sheep's milk are fantastic: goat's milk cheese 
is typically creamy and elegant, with a soft texture and dry aftertaste, while sheep's milk cheese is often savory 
and firm, with a smooth texture and a light nuttiness. But when you can get them together, as the talented 
hands behind Mobay® Cheese have done, that's something else entirely. Crafted for us by the certifed Master 
Cheesemakers at a renowned Wisconsin creamery, our latest Spotlight Cheese is made by stacking together 
wheels of flavorful goat's milk cheese and sheep's milk cheese, with just a thin layer of faintly smoky grapevine 
ash in between them. 

Mobay® is a tantalizingly delicious tandem; a showcase for the best aspects of goat's milk cheese and sheep's 
milk cheese, as well as an opportunity to explore how exponentially delicious they taste when eaten together. 
Best enjoyed in situations where you can truly sit and savor their complex, creamy flavors, try serving Mobay® 
on crackers or crostini, with plenty of dried and fresh fruit to pair it with. Be sure to try both halves on their 
own and together - you especially don't want to miss out on experiencing the complementary flavor that the 
grapevine ash brings. And unless you want to miss out on Mobay® entirely, be sure to grab it quick - supplies 
are limited, after all.

"""There are two types of people who eat truffles: those who think truffles are good because they are dear 

and those who know they are dear because they are good.""
Jean-Louis Vaudoyer

Oh, truffles.  For thousands of years, you've inspired such passion, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern 
America.  You've also inspired Trader Joe's Italian Truffle Cheese, which is definitely dear because it is good.
Our Italian Truffle Cheese is made with black truffles from central Italy's Umbria region. Made from 
pasteurized cow's milk, it's a young cheese, aged for 15 days. Its mild flavor makes it the ideal canvas for the 
concentrated truffle oil and black truffle pieces that are blended liberally throughout the cheese. The truffles' 
earthy, woody, musky aroma shines, and on the palate, it delivers with aplomb.  The semi-soft nature makes 
this an excellent melting cheese - it's delicious melted over roasted meats, makes delightful omelets, and adds 
dynamic dimension to pasta or potato dishes.  It also makes a bold statement on a cheese board.

We're selling Trader Joe's Italian Truffle Cheese in random-weight pieces of about eight ounces You'll find it 
in our cheese case.

"Admist the pastoral splendor and rolling, verdant hills of the New Zealand countryside, you'll find countless 
dairy farms covering the land. On these farms, grass-fed cows produce remarkably rich, deliciously creamy 
milk. On one such farm in particular, the master cheesemakers use this milk to craft a soft, easy-eating Cheddar, 
then age it for six to twelve months to give it a nice sharp note and full-flavored profile. And after all that, they 
ship it off to us, where it becomes Trader Joe's New Zealand Grass Fed Sharp Cheddar.

With its mild, creamy base, punctuated nutty notes, and hint of cultured butter, this New Zealand Cheddar is 
quite versatile for a white Cheddar. It slices nicely for inclusion in sandwiches and burgers, it melts wonderfully 
for queso dips or cheesy potato soups, and postively wows when shredded and served over a fresh plate of 
Handsome Cut Fries [sku 96143]. And if that weren't enough, it fares just as well on a cheese plate, especially

"The Triple Crème de la Crème
The Triple Crème of the Crop

Like the Cat that got the Triple Crème 

In 1928, crafted by a small-time fromager in the Southern French countryside commune of Villefranche de 
Rouergue, Saint André Triple Cream Brie can find its roots. This same region, notable for its famed Roquefort 
cheeses, debuted this beautifully soft-ripened, triple cream cheese we have kept in our cheese refrigerators for 
years. Taking flavorful cues from equal parts tang and density from sour cream and the sweetness of whipped 
cream and marrying them together with a classic brie base, Saint André Triple Cream Brie is a cheese for 
the unyielding connoisseur. Gourmands unite! This Saint André Triple Cream Brie has a bloomy, edible rind 
surrounding a lusciously smooth, creamy paste made from cow's milk and enriched with pure cream. This 
cheese has no less than 75% butterfat making every bite full of dreamy creamy delight.

"This product has been a project long in the making... When we were forced to find a new supplier for our shelf-
stable, private-label Grated Parmesan Cheese, we initially partnered with the Colonna Brothers® to bring in 
their version of the product until we could create a perfect Parm. of our own. Well, Dear Customers, the day 
for Perfect Parm has finally arrived!

Unlike most big-brand versions of Parmesan-in-a-jar, Trader Joe's Grated Parmesan Cheese is free of 
potassium sorbate, a preservative often added to mantain flavor and shelf-life. Like all of our private-label 
dairy products, it's also made only with milk from cows not treated with rBST. Call us cheesy, but we'd say that's 
a double win!

Whether you plan to pour it over pasta, sprinkle it on a salad, or mix it into mac-'n-cheese, the price on Trader 
Joe's Grated Parmesan Cheese should put a winning smile on your face, too-we're selling the stuff in eight-
ounce, shakeable jars for $2.99* each. You'll find them in our grocery aisle.

"Some say three's a crowd. We say the more the merrier-especially when it comes to cheese! Our Shredded 
Three Cheese Blend [sku 16541] is a popular customer favorite, and for good reason. It's a blend of our most 
popular cheeses (Mozzarella, Monterey Jack and Cheddar) that's got loads of savory, cheesy flavor, and superior 
meltability. (The convenient resealable pouch doesn't hurt, either.) 

Never ones to rest on cheesy laurels, we took the ""Does it get any better than this?"" challenge with this favorite 
blend of fromages in mind, and our Product Developer emerged with Trader Joe's Organic Shredded 3 Cheese 
Blend. It's a blend of the same three varieties (low moisture part skim Mozzarella, Monterey Jack and Cheddar 
Cheeses), all made with organic milk sourced from cows that were never treated with rBST. 

Even better, inside this bag of Shredded Cheese you'll find the savory, cheesy flavor and maximum meltability 
you desire for all of your cheese needs. Keep a bag handy for Taco Tuesday. Toss a hearty handful into corn 
chowder or beer cheese soup. Or go old school and use this Organic 3 Cheese Blend in a grilled cheese sand-
wich (feel free to throw some Fire Roasted Diced Green Chiles [sku 54452] in there, if you're so inclined).

We're offering 8-ounce resealable pouches of Trader Joe's Organic Shredded 3 Cheese Blend for $4.49, every-
day. You'll find them in our cheese case.

"Start spreading the news - there's a flavored Cream Cheese Spread at Trader Joe's! With spring on the horizon 
(okay, fine, it's not quite on the horizon, but let's just go with it¿), we felt the time was as right as any to

"The lush, green pastures of New Zealand's organic dairy farms provide the jumping off point for our 
Sliced New Zealand Organic Cheddar. The milk used to produce this distinctive cheese comes from 
cows raised on family owned dairies and treated to a diet of the abundant organic clover and grasses that 
blanket the pastures of New Zealand's dairy lands. Moderate temperatures (60-75ºF), flowing mountain 
streams, and abundant rainfall mean that there is ample pasture for grazing year round. Because of their 
diet, the cows produce incredibly rich and flavorful milk, and that milk, in turn, produces incredibly rich 
and flavorful cheese.

Trader Joe's Sliced New Zealand Organic Cheddar is aged for three to six months, enough time to al-
low its fresh and creamy profile to fully emerge. It's excellent on burgers, as a quick snack, and of course, 
on sandwiches, cold or hot - try it on a grilled cheese with arugula and fig butter! 

We're selling an eight ounce package of about eight slices for $4.99, every day. That's a cheesy value!

"We've long considered feta cheese to be practically synonymous with Mediterranean cuisine. In fact, we can 
hardly conceive of a Mediterranean meal without it. Can you even imagine a crispy spanakopita sans creamy 
feta? Wouldn't falafel feel awfully lonely without a few feta crumbles? Wouldn't a feta-less Greek salad be 
reduced to a salad without a country? Luckily, we don't have to deal in such alarming hypotheticals, because 
we've got Trader Joe's Israeli Feta at the ready.

Since feta has such a long and storied history (records show that feta and feta-like cheeses have been eaten 
in the Mediterranean region for thousands of years, and even garnered a mention in Homer's Odyssey), we 
knew we needed a supplier who would respect that history. That's why we reached out to a 4th generation 
cheesemaker in Israel, whose family has been in the dairy business for over a century. Their feta speaks for 
itself: creamy, crumbly, and toothsome, with a wonderfully soft texture and a mild, tart tang - exactly how a 
feta ought to be.

While we recommend using this Israeli Feta in all the ways you normally would for a delicious Mediterranean 
fetas, we also strongly encourage you to enjoy it as a table cheese or part of a cheese plate. A feta of this quality, 
with its subtle acidity and fine brininess, deserves to be savored, esepcailly with a glass of crisp or off-dry white 
wine. In addition to its synonymity with all things Mediterranean, you can also consider Trader Joe's Israeli 
Feta to be synonymous with value: we're selling each 8.8-ounce piece for the remarkably reasonable price of 
$5.99. You'll find them in our cheese case.

"Translated from the Latin word recocta (recooked), ricotta is made by cooking the whey that is left behind after 
making other cheeses. Cool, right? We've carried a fat-free version of this classic cheese for quite some time, but 
as palates and preferences are wont to change when it comes to food trends, we felt the existing product could 
use a refresh of sorts. Without further adieu, we're pleased to welcome Trader Joe's Part Skim Ricotta Cheese 
to our cheese case.

To find a Part Skim Ricotta Cheese aligned with Trader Joe's standards (tastes excellent, offers amazing value, 
and made with milk from cows not treated with rBST), our product developer went to Wisconsin, a state that's 
second to none when it comes to cheesemaking capability. The cheese monger combines pasteurized whey, 
cream, milk, vinegar and a touch of salt to produce a cheese that's rich, creamy and slightly grainy in texture, 
with a fresh, slightly sweet flavor. What's more, a one-quarter cup serving of this rich, creamy, kosher (dairy) 
goodness has just 70 calories, 4.5 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein!

The clean, versatile flavor of Part Skim Ricotta Cheese leaves it open to all sorts of culinary interpretation. 
Enjoy it with a few cracks of salt & pepper, olive oil and chopped fresh herbs. Bake it into a rigatoni casserole 
with spicy sausage and marinara. Its slight sweetness lends itself to dessert as well-may we suggest a fancy, 
fresh ricotta parfait with sliced Strawberries [sku 35878] and a drizzle of Turkish Honey [sku 53382]?

We're offering 16-ounce tubs of Trader Joe's Part Skim Ricotta Cheese for $3.49-that's a whole dollar lower

"Way, way, way back in 2008, we introduced a very special product. A product that almost instantly captured the 
hearts and minds of Crew and customers alike. That product was Chèvre with Honey. To this day it's a Trader 
Joe's cheese case staple. We've decided, though, to give it a bit of a makeover¿

Trader Joe's Chèvre with Honey Goat's Milk Cheese is the same fantastic cheese we've been selling for ten 
years, but now in a five-ounce log with an updated label. Crafted using traditional techniques and goat's milk 
from small family farms in the Midwest, this Chèvre combines the sweet goodness of honey with the tangy 
temptation of goat cheese. 

One of the reasons for the enormous popularity of this cheese is not just its deliciousness or uniqueness, but 
also its versatility. You can enjoy it in the same way we did when we first encountered this product years ago: 
slathered thick on slices of crusty Organic French Baguette [sku 53835] and popped under the broiler for a 
couple minutes. Trust us, it's an instant crowd-pleaser. It's equally as wonderful when served with crackers and 
fruit, or spread on a piece of toast with Raspberry Preserves [sku 87805] in the early a.m. Atop a burger, intrigu-
ing in an omelet, crumbled onto a salad, whipped up for a dessert¿ 

We're selling these slightly smaller five-ounce logs of Trader Joe's Chèvre with Honey Goat's Milk Cheese for 
$2.99 each, every day.

"Having been around for almost 10 years, our Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923] is hardly unexpected anymore-
at least for our regular Customers. Just to be clear, this is not to say that the extraordinary effect this cheese has 
on one's taste buds has diminished in any sort of way! On the contrary, the smooth creaminess of finely crafted 
American Cheddar is still fused with the tangy, crumbly texture of a hard, aged Italian cheese¿ and it's still 
surprisingly satisfying for the cheese-lover.

Knowing the popularity of this cheese and knowing that our Customers are always looking for more ways to 
enjoy it, we've made the bold (and perhaps unexpected!) move to offer it in handy, Shredded form. This eight-
ounce package contains large shreds of Unexpected Cheddar (an ounce more than the cut pieces we sell), 
ready for topping salads, soups, and open-faced sandwiches. This delicious cheese also works well in (and is 
now more easily added to) quesadillas, chili, sauces-whatever meal might require the complement of this 
classic Trader Joe's cheese.
