"079150","Cranberry Ginger Chutney","There's more than one way to sauce a cranberry. We prove it over and over again each holiday season, when our 
cache of cranberry condiments arrives on our shelves and in our refrigerators. We have options that can cater 
to anyone's cranberry cravings, and this year, we've added yet another standout to the cranberry condiment 
crowd: Trader Joe's Cranberry Ginger Chutney. 

Inspired by the aromatic flavors of South Indian cuisine, Trader Joe's Cranberry Ginger Chutney invites a 
welcome touch of global inspiration to your Thanksgiving table. Our supplier starts by boiling whole cranberries, 
but only lightly, so as to maintain a chunky texture. Next, they sweeten them with sugar and combine them 
with ginger, garlic, and cayenne pepper, resulting in a sweet and savory profile that plays well with the tangy, 
tart fruitiness of the cranberries. Enjoy this Chutney with your turkey dinner, give it a supporting role on your 
next charcuterie board, or use it as spread for crackers, sanwiches, wraps, and more!

"079820","White Queso Dip","Guacamole, salsa, and queso dip are the holy trinity of scoopable Mexican restaurant appetizers. Peruse the 
refrigerators at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, and you'll notice we're two for three on this front, with a 
plethora of guacamole and salsa options to choose from. With the debut of Trader Joe's White Queso Dip, 
we're finally three for three!

Our Queso starts with tangy white cheddar-it comprises 50% of the recipe, in fact! We mix in cream for extra 
richness, plus sea salt and onion for savory aromatics. Mild red & green bell peppers add a touch of sweetness 
(and festive red & green speckles throughout), while diced jalapeños lend a just-right amount of heat. Go 
ahead, shovel a tortilla chip-full into your mouth-your tastebuds will love this Queso's restaurant quality 
flavor, and your wallet will appreciate you skipping the takeout. 

For vegetarian nachos, drizzle a generous helping of Queso over a plate of White Corn Tortilla Chips [sku 
95347], then cover them with crumbled Soy Chorizo [sku 92463] and Hot & Sweet Jalapeños, if you're feeling 
especially spicy. Or, pay homage to Tijuana, Mexico's quesabirria tacos by spreading some Queso Dip onto 
Corn Tortillas [sku 92394], topping them with Beef Birria [sku 72620], folding them over into tacos, and pan 
frying until crispy and melty. Don't forget to save the birria juice for dipping!

"091113","Sweet Chili Sauce","Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce is our authentic take on the sweet-hot blend of chilies and garlic used in 
kitchens across Thailand. Our supplier adds whole red chilies and Thai garlic to a sweet & sour-like concoction, 
creating a versatile sauce that can be used as a condiment, dip, stir-fry sauce, or appetizer component. We 
like it on burgers and Korean Style Short Ribs [sku 90809], or brushed on chicken before grilling. It's a natural 
for dipping things like gyoza, egg rolls or Chicken Spring Rolls [sku 55571]. You may try grilling peaches or 
nectarines and dipping them in Sweet Chili Sauce. It's also surprisingly delicious served over softened cream 
cheese and served with crackers - a quick, super-easy hors d'oeuvre that will leave your guests begging for the

"078789","Thick, Bold & Spicy Red Sauce","When it comes to pasta sauces, we offer more variety than we do in some other food categories. While you 
may only desire the singular, best Organic Ketchup [sku 55860] to satisfy your ketchup cravings, your cravings 
for different styles of pasta sauce may fluctuate day to day, meal to meal. With this in mind, we concluded that 
our assortment of sauces was missing a richer, bolder, tomato-based option. This is where Trader Joe's Thick, 
Bold & Spicy Red Sauce comes in!

The name sort of says it all, but let's break it down a bit... This Red Sauce begins as any homemade tomato 
sauce might, with diced tomatoes in juice, tomato paste, garlic, diced onion, and oil (we opted for extra virgin 
olive oil here). The addition of basil, honey, and sun-dried tomatoes work together to develop a more nuanced 
flavor profile than a standard red sauce. So far, so Bold-where's the Spicy? The heat comes with a carefully 
concocted combo of peppers that includes crushed red pepper, ancho chili pepper powder, black pepper, and 
paprika. Finally, all these ingredients are simmered until reaching a Thick, rich texture.

Trader Joe's Thick, Bold & Spicy Red Sauce is so good on all kinds of pasta, from Organic Spaghetti [sku 
78011] to Chickpea Fusilli [sku 78268]. Beyond pasta, it also works incredibly well as a tasty dipping sauce for 
your oven-warmed Ciabatta Baguette [sku 96398], or for TJ's ready-to-bake Organic Garlic Bread [sku 77219]. 
You'll find sixteen-ounce jars of Thick, Bold & Spicy Red Sauce on our shelves among a variety of delicious 
pasta sauces, every day!

"078961","Enchilada Sauce","Enchiladas might just be the very definition of comfort food: layers of hearty rolled tortillas, rich, savory, and 
often meaty fillings, gloriously melty cheese...and, of course, vividly full-flavored sauce to bind it all together. 
In fact, the sauce might just be the most important element of enchiladas to get right, which is why we proudly 
carry Trader Joe's Enchilada Sauce on our shelves. It's made for us by a trusted supplier, who starts with a 
base of tomato paste and red jalapeño purée, then seasons it with ground red chiles, onion, garlic, and chipotle 
pepper powder. What they don't use are any gums, natural flavors, or artificial preservatives, so that your 
homemade enchiladas will taste homemade, every time.

Savory, smoky, and ever-so-slightly spicy, our bold and full-flavored Enchilada Sauce won't just make your 
enchiladas tastier, they'll make them a lot easier, too: simply roll corn or flour torillas up with your favorite 
fillings (we find it's a little easier if you fry the tortillas in oil for a second or two beforehand), line them up 
in a baking dish, cover with Enchilada Sauce and your favorite cheese, and bake! And if that wasn't enough, 
we also find that it's quite suited for making Mexican cuisine-inspired casseroles, or even using as a sauce for  
making chilaquiles, too.

"080035","Thai Style Peanut Dressing","When is a salad dressing more than a salad dressing? How about when it's also a great dip, condiment, marinade,  
sauce for a uniquely sweet and spicy pizza... All of these would make an entirely apt description for Trader 
Joe's Thai Style Peanut Dressing, but, truth be told, ""Trader Joe's Thai Style Peanut Dressing (and Dip, and 
Condiment, and Marinade, and Pizza Sauce...)"" just wouldn't quite fit on the bottle. It's made for us using the 
same recipe as the dressing found in Trader Joe's Crunchy Slaw [sku 80035], a longtime Crew and customer 
favorite in our West Coast stores, where its complex mix of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors earned it a spot as 
a solo act in Trader Joe's across the country.

Our Thai Style Peanut Dressing is so versatile, that even within just the context of salads, it's marvelously 
multifaceted: we recommend it for everything from light, leafy salads to hearty slaws, all the way to creamy 
pasta and potato salads, too. As for its dip qualifications, give it a spin with spring rolls or savory meat skewers. 
As a condiment, it's excellent on burgers and bánh mì-inspired creations. It makes a magnificent marinade for 
grilled chicken wings or steak, and a super sauce for a Thai-style pizza with chicken breast, cilantro, and sliced 
green onion.

"078297","Hoisin Sauce","Named for the Cantonese word for ""seafood,"" hoisin sauce gets its moniker not by virtue of containing 
seafood as an ingredient (it traditionally contains no animal-derived products, sea-based or not), nor by being 
specifically designed for serving with seafood (although it is, indeed, great with fish.) Rather, its title comes 
from the fact that its rich aromas and umami undertones evoke an ineffable, subtly seafood-y quality that's 
celebrated in Szechuan cuisine. To that, we'd also add that a great hoisin sauce, like Trader Joe's Hoisin Sauce, 
also expresses a certain sticky sweetness, savory character, and velvety texture that make it one of the more 
versatile condiments you'll ever find.

Made for us by a supplier in Thailand, who starts with a base of fermented soy bean paste, black sesame paste, 
and brown sugar, each batch of our full-flavored Hoisin Sauce is seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices like 
star anise, garlic powder, coriander seed, and Szechuan peppercorns. You may have had hoisin with roast duck, 
spring rolls, and noodle soups before-all excellent pairings, but that's hardly where we'd stop. We recommend 
drizzling our Hoisin over stir-fried vegetables, fried rice, bánh mì sandwiches, burgers, barbecued ribs, grilled 
shrimp or salmon, or even just using it as a sweet and savory dip for Fries [sku 96143].

"079675","Chicken Uncured Bacon Ranch Dip","There's a group of ingredients that have been trending online for quite a while amongst lovers of savory, 
comforting recipes. This combination comes in the form of casseroles, skillet meals, sheet-pan recipes, 
sandwiches, salads, and even dips. In fact, this combo is the inspiration for Trader Joe's Chicken Uncured 
Bacon Ranch Dip!

Our version starts with a mixture of sour cream, shredded sharp Cheddar, cream cheese, mayo, and buttermilk. 
This creates a rich, creamy, cheesy base with a hint of tanginess. Then we add plenty of shredded, rotisserie-
style Chicken breast and pieces of Uncured Bacon. (Uncured, meaning there are no nitrites or nitrates added, 
except what's naturally occurring in sea salt and celery juice.) As if cheese, Chicken, and Bacon weren't enough, 
we finish the recipe with a custom, Ranch-style seasoning blend of herbs & spices, including chives, parsley, 
dill, garlic & onion.

While you can eat it cold, this Dip is really made to be heated. That's as easy as putting it in a microwave-safe 
bowl, and heating it 2-3 minutes at 30-second intervals until it's heated through. Then comes the dipping! 
The dip-list is limitless, but you might start with celery sticks, Les Petite Carrots of Many Colors [sku 57285], 
Pita Bite Crackers [sku 90701], Fall Leaf Tortilla Chips [sku 66065], and slices of toasted Organic Baguette [sku

"072519","Sweet Potato Habanero Hot Sauce","In the collective imagination, autumn flavors aren't typically associated with a whole lot of heat, per se-and if 
you ask us, that's a shame. As we approach the autumn months, and temperatures begin to lower, it's the perfect 
time for hearty chilis, capsaicin-loaded curries, super-spicy soups, and red-hot roasted veggies and proteins of 
all kinds. In support of this autumnal argument, we submit Trader Joe's Sweet Potato Habanero Hot Sauce. 
Made for us by a famed hot sauce supplier out of Atlanta, Georgia, each batch is made from a base of vinegar, 
sweet potatoes, and habanero peppers, as well as a mix of autumnally-appropriate spices like cinnamon, ginger, 
allspice, and cloves.

This marriage of peppery heat and fall flavors results in a one-of-a-kind Hot Sauce that's as versatile as it is 
unique. Aside from its use in the afore-mentioned hearty soups and roasts that autumn is known for, it also 
goes great with everyday fare like pizza, chicken wings, tacos, and all sorts of savory breakfast options. And for 
a fiery, dip that makes a great late summer or early autumn appetizer, simply mix a teaspoon or two with Greek 
Yogurt [sku 69707] and enjoy with French fries or Tots [sku 94904].

"078791","Pizza Sauce","At Trader Joe's, a product doesn't pass muster just once-it must do so again and again, long after it launches, 
to ensure our customers are as excited about it as our tasting panel was when it was first presented. Recently, 
our buyer applied this standard for satisfaction and deliciousness to our preexisting pizza sauce, and knew we 
could do better. And after a few rounds of tasting and tweaking an array of sauce options, we did-allow us to 
(re)introduce Trader Joe's Pizza Sauce! 

With a bright tomato flavor and more subtly seasoned profile than its predecessor, this Pizza Sauce provides a 
savory base layer that complements pizza toppings without overpowering them, and makes for a mighty tasty 
Breaded Mozzarella Cheese Sticks [sku 50209] dip, too. An added bonus: it's packed into shelf-stable jars, so you 
can always have a jar of Pizza Sauce at the ready when the craving strikes. 

In addition to our tasting panel standards for satisfaction and delicious, this kosher-certified Sauce passes 
muster when it comes to value, too. If ""pizza party"" is in your day planner, pop on over to your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's, where you'll find jars of Pizza Sauce on our grocery shelves for an incredible price, every day.

"062527","Ponzu Sauce","If you've ever been to a restaurant that serves poke, chances are that you've already experienced the uniquely 
tart, tangy, and umami-rich flavor of ponzu. Traditionally made with a base of rice vinegar, bonito broth, rice 
wine, and some manner of citrus juice, ponzu is a pitch-perfect sauce for seasoning fish for poke and sashimi, 
but that's hardly where we'd stop. Made for us by an expert supplier in Japan, Trader Joe's Ponzu Sauce can 
add an element of sweetness, savoriness, and richness to all sorts of dishes, from the simplest of rice bowls to 
the most complex of marinades.

Trader Joe's Ponzu Sauce is made in the style of shoyu ponzu, meaning it has a soy sauce base-ponzu without 
soy sauce tends to not keep very well on the shelf. Our supplier's recipe also subs out the rice wine in favor of 
a bit of sugar to provide a sweet contrast to the delightfully tart yuzu juice used in every batch. We find that 
this balance of ingredients makes it a more-than-capable condiment for pretty much any savory application in 
the kitchen, and especially so for making flavorful salad dressings, dipping with tempura, pan-fried gyoza, and 
other crispy appetizers, or mixing into burger patties for an extra bonito-powered boost of umami.

"077581","Yuzu Miso Topping & Spread","Combining two iconically Japanese ingredients into one uniquely delicious sauce, Trader Joe's Yuzu Miso 
Topping & Spread is a curiously captivating condiment, unlike any other we've offered before. On tasting it, 
you'll likely first notice its rich, luxuriously thick consistency, then the savory, umami-filled notes of its white 
miso paste base, which perfectly leads into the pleasantly tart tones of its mixed-in yuzu zest and yuzu juice. 
Then, once you've had a chance to take it all in, the elegant balance between its savory and citric elements ought 
to immediately inspire you with all the possibilities for where you can use it..

And indeed, the possibilities are practically endless: it's spectacular spread over grilled seafood, it's stupendous 
on a seared steak, and it adds remarkable depth of flavor to roast chicken. But that's just the beginning. From 
the simple (drizzled over a bowl of plain white rice, dunked with Handsome Cut Potato Fries [sku 96143] 
or Organic Chicken Nuggets [sku 67594]) to the sophisticated (mixed into marinades for pork ribs, served 
alongside charcuterie boards, or as a spread for an especially ornate sandwich), Trader Joe's Yuzu Miso 
Topping & Spread will add an unmistakeably umami, tantalizingly tart element to them all.

flavors... And lucky for you, Trader Joe's Organic Mango Vinaigrette Dressing deftly incorporates each of 
these attributes, setting the table for some fantastically fresh, summer fare.

A fairly simple blend of organic mango purée, vegetable oil, distilled white vinegar, and cane sugar (plus organic 
orange juice concentrate, dried red bell peppers, and garlic powder for added vim and vigor), our Organic 
Mango Vinaigrette lends itself to all sorts of applications. You can, of course, add a splash to salads (spinach 
+ feta + toasted almonds + Organic Mango Vinaigrette = yum), or you can use it as a marinade for grilled 
chicken. Or as a fancy inclusion for fish tacos. Or as the star of a cold noodle dish or pasta salad...

"073601","Yuzu Kosho","The trick behind many great hot sauces and spicy condiments is a balance between tartness and heat-in 
a classic Buffalo sauce, for example, this is most often achieved via a carefully calibrated ratio of vinegar to 
cayenne. However, in the case of yuzu kosho, a chili paste popular in Japanese cuisine, it's less of a balancing act 
and more of a gleeful deep dive into both ends of the spectrum. Made with a captivating combination of chili 
peppers, sea salt, and peel of yuzu (a citrus that's downright essential in Japanese cuisine), Trader Joe's Yuzu 
Kosho offers thrilling heat, invigorating zestiness, and even a touch of umami in every bracing bite.

Our Yuzu Kosho's savory, sour, and spicy notes make it a more-than-capable condiment for all kinds of 
applications: it's an excellent spread for a sandwich, a terrific topper for freshly-seared scallops, and a superb 
sauce for spicing up a slice of pizza. Try mixing it into your next marinade for barbecued chicken wings, or 
adding a spoonful to a salad dressing for a little extra oomph. And for a truly special dip for French fries, Tots 
[sku 94094], and Organic Chicken Nuggets [sku 67594], add a bit of Yuzu Kosho to a small bowl of mayonnaise 
and sprinkle with Furikake [sku 60255].

"077302","French Vinaigrette with Shallots","A great salad dressing should accomplish three things: for starters, it shouldn't be too thick-at that point, 
it's just dip. Second, it should expertly complement your salad ingredients. And third, it should of course, be 
delicious. We're delighted to report that Trader Joe's French Vinaigrette with Shallots handily meets these 
salad dressing standards.

Sporting a signature tanginess courtesy of red wine vinegar and Dijon mustard, this French Vinaigrette with 
Shallots offers from-scratch flavor without the hassle that tends to accompany from-scratch preparation. Its 
subtle, sophisticated flavors and easily poured nature create a classic Paris bistro vibe wherever you splash 
it-on Little Gem Lettuce [sku 76869], in a marinade for chicken or fish, over of-the-moment veggies (think 
steamed Artichokes [sku 76894] or grilled Zucchini [sku 20491]), or in a picnic-ready pasta salad. (Give the 
bottle a good shake prior to use-just like a from-scratch dressing, you won't find gums or thickeners here!)

This authentic, made-in-France classic is an astonishing value-and now available on the grocery shelves at 
your neighborhood Trader Joe's, every day.

"026426","Soy Sauce Reduced Sodium","Everyone knows soy sauce is salty. It's like the Asian-cuisine equivalent to a shaker of table salt. People use it 
liberally to add verve to all kinds of dishes, from stir-frys and noodle soups-to meats and vegetables. Just a 
little transforms bland white rice into something of a meal. And when it comes to recipes, it often serves as the 
base for sauces and marinades.

Despite its popularity, soy sauce's saltiness (say that ten times fast!) also means high sodium-something more 
and more people are choosing to avoid. Accordingly, the only soy sauce we sell is Trader Joe's Reduced Sodium 
Soy Sauce. With 530mg of sodium per 1 Tbsp. serving, it contains about 50% less sodium than leading soy 
sauce brands. Lower sodium aside, our Soy Sauce is made with the traditional Honjozo method, which uses 
a 6 month to 2 year natural brewing and fermentation approach. This means Trader Joe's Reduced Sodium 
Soy Sauce tastes authentic and is ideal for all your soy sauce needs. We're pretty sure you won't even notice the

slightly-less-acidic flavor-and Trader Joe's Organic 100% Sicilian Lemon Juice captures the essence of an 
Italian lemon grove in a bottle. 

We know what you're thinking: ""Gee, Trader Joe's, couldn't I just squeeze my own organic lemons?"" Why, 
certainly you can! Easy-peasy lemon-squeezy, as they say. But squeezing your own organic Silcilian lemons 
might be a little trickier, as Sicilian lemons aren't as commonly found in stateside stores. Plus, you simply can't 
argue with the sheer convenience of having not-from-concentrate Lemon Juice on-demand. And whereas 
most bottled lemon juice is made from concentrate and infused with preservatives, ours contains nothing but

"050784","Cowboy Caviar Salsa","Legend has it that the Cowboy Caviar concept was originally developed around 1930 for an ""all Texas"" 
menu at a high-end department store. The head chef was mandated to include black-eyed-peas on the menu.  
Since she personally loathed the legumes, to make them palatable, she pickled them with onions, creating a 
salad-esque salsa -- ""Cowboy Caviar"" --  that has since become a cult classic.  

Strap on your spurs, Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar is now in your town. Since we love cult classics, 
especially of the crazy, creative culinary concoction class, and we've had good success with our other less-
than-ordinary salsas, we decided to create our very own Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar. Instead of black-
eyed peas, however, our ""caviar"" of choice is black beans that are mixed together with corn, onions and 
red bell peppers. Pickled in a blend of chipotle peppers, adobo sauce and lime juice, this crunchy, savory 
salsation carries southwestern character and enough heat to take note. It's a natural partner to tortilla chips 
and makes a delicious fish taco topping. Gluten-free, fat-free, low in sodium and vegan, Cowboy Caviar 
has ""cult-classic character"" written all over it, especially at just $2.49 for a 13 ounce jar. Yee-haw!

balsamic glaze available and within arm's reach, without having to take the time to 
reduce our own balsamic vinegar every time the craving struck.  And that's exactly 
what's inside this squeeze bottle. 
 
Balsamic Glaze is made for us in Modena, Italy, home of some of the world's best 
balsamic vinegar.  It's crafted using traditional methods, so it has the deep flavor and 
pungent aroma you expect. You can, of course, reduce balsamic vinegar over a flame to 
achieve a similar consistency, but that takes precious time and tends to increase the 
acidity of the vinegar.  Our Balsamic Glaze is ready to use and it preserves an ideal 
balance of sweet and bitter.  It's made by combining concentrated grape must and 
balsamic vinegar, then using a special filtration process that results in the thicker 
consistency that makes this Glaze so versatile.  Use it on salads, as a drizzle over grilled 
meat and fish, or as a dessert topping for fresh, summertime berries.  We're selling each 
8.5 fluid ounce bottle for $2.99, every day, making it a time saver and a money saver!","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20405/97892.png","2.99","[""Alfresco Dining"",""Cheese Board"",""Date Night"",""Feeling Fancy"",""Gild The Lily"",""Pour It On"",""The \""X\"" Factor""]",,"[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1 Tbsp.

"097915","Reduced Guilt Spinach & Kale Greek Yogurt Dip","Trader Joe's S&KGYD (that's Spinach & Kale Greek Yogurt Dip, as the header up above might have indicated) 
is a downright delicious. And thanks to its key ingredients-specifically, low-fat Greek yogurt-it has just 2g 
of fat & 30 calories per two-tablespoon serving. That's 75% less fat than regular spinach dip made with sour 
cream. Every tub is packed with Spinach & Kale, with finely chopped water chestnuts, red peppers, carrots, 
green onions, garlic on board contributing major flavor and texture. The recipe includes with a bit of mayo for 
extra smoothness, and just a touch of agave nectar to add subtle sweetness.  

S&KGYD is a natural choice to pair with fresh vegetable crudités or crackers and a superstar on sandwiches 
in place of mayo or other traditional condiments-whether it's turkey & cheese, piled high roast beef, an 
abundance of roasted vegetables, or even a freshly grilled burger, the flavor & texture of this Dip really shine.  

TJ's S&KGYD is made exclusively for us, so you'll find it only in the refrigerated case at your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's. We're selling each 16-ounce tub for the excellent everyday price of $4.49.

"077247","Thai Peanut Satay Sauce","Satay may be the one of most celebrated street foods in the history of global cuisine. Originating in Malaysia 
possibly as far back as the 1400s, love for satay has spread across Southeast Asia in the ensuing centuries, 
including the Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, where it has since been enshrined as a national 
dish. Now a favorite among foodies the world over, the popularity of satay skewers has brought with it a 
commensurate appreciation for satay sauce (also known as sambal kacang.) As our very own Trader Joe's Thai 
Peanut Satay Sauce demonstrates, this sweet, savory, and lightly spicy peanut-based sauce makes the ideal 
accompaniment to a classic chicken satay skewer-and so much more, too.

Made for us by a supplier in Thailand, our Peanut Satay Sauce starts with a base of rich coconut milk, peanuts, 
and aromatic red curry paste, to which our supplier adds a mix of savory seasonings including lemongrass, 
shallot, garlic, galangal, and tamarind paste. In addition to making a delicious dipping sauce for grilled, 
skewered proteins of all kinds (we're especially fond of it with shrimp, pork loin, or tofu), it also makes a 
fantastic condiment for burgers and lettuce wraps, and a superb sauce for serving over Thai Wheat Noodles 
[sku 62742]. And for an effortless and flavorful salad dressing, simply add a bit of Rice Vinegar [sku 76721] to  
a few spoonfuls of Satay Sauce in a bowl, mix, and enjoy.

"076262","Rosatella Pasta Sauce","When it's pasta night, if you have a hard time choosing between the tangy brightness of marinara and the silky 
creaminess of alfredo-then don't! Enjoy the best of both worlds with Trader Joe's Rosatella Pasta Sauce.

This ""pink sauce"" really delivers on flavor, and it's no wonder considering the quality of what goes into the jar. 
Our supplier in Italy sources all of their dairy from the Piedmont region-a region renowned for its milk and 
cheeses. They start with a cream & milk blend, to which they add a short list of ingredients, including tomato 
paste, onion & garlic purées, basil, oregano, and Grana Padano PDO cheese. 

Boil your favorite TJ's pasta until it's al dente, then drain and mix with our Rosatella Pasta Sauce. The bright

"061934","Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce","There's a great big world of hot sauces out there, from the straightforward and simple (like our Chili Pepper 
Sauce [sku 92484] to the deceptively versatile (like our Sriracha Sauce [sku 50828]). Some hot sauces blast you 
with heat upfront, thrilling your taste buds with immediate urgency. Others subtly sneak in heat, coupling their 
capsicum with complementary sensations and flavors. And others still, like Trader Joe's Italian Bomba Hot 
Pepper Sauce, build heat, bite by bite, until you reach a crescendo of spice so invigorating, that it paradoxically 
keeps you coming back for more.

Made with Calabrian chili peppers sourced from a trusted pepper cultivator in Calabria, Italy (the ""toe"" of Italy's 
""boot,"" if you will), our Italian Bomba Hot Sauce is our tribute to a centuries-old culinary tradition. Since 
the 1500s, Calabrian hot chili peppers have been a staple of Southern Italian cuisine, especially when crushed, 
fermented, and mixed into a firey hot condiment, just like this Bomba Sauce. The natural fruity notes of the 
peppers are amplified by the slightly pickled flavor and texture they take on during fermentation, making it 
particularly suited for pasta dishes and pizzas. And, like a ticking time bomb (""Bomba"" is Italian for bomb, after 
all), the more you eat, the more heat develops, until it (and whatever you put it on) is bursting with flavor.

While most specialty Italian grocers might charge you upwards of $8 or $9 for a jar of Calabrian pepper sauce, at 
Trader Joe's, you can find our 6.7-ounce jars of Italian Bomba Hot Pepper Sauce, made from authentic Calabrian 
chilies and authentically imported from Italy, for the steaming hot price of $2.99. Look for them in our Grocery aisle.

"075537","Guacasalsa","There's more to an avocado than just guacamole, and one need look no further than Trader Joe's Guacasalsa 
for proof. This tangy, tantalizing take on a classic salsa de aguacate is made with a base of tart tomatillos and 
creamy avocados, to which our supplier adds jalapeños for spice, cilantro for aromatic herbiness, garlic purée 
for a savory edge, and a touch of lime juice to keep everything in balance. All together, this sublimely simple 
recipe results in super smooth and satisfying salsa that's great for dipping with chips, mixing into sauces, or 
spooning over pretty much anything you can think of.

Seriously: try it on homemade nachos, atop a burger, drizzled over a brown rice bowl with seared salmon and 
roasted broccolini...Guacasalsa will bring a burst of bright, lightly spicy flavor to them all. When it comes to 
dipping, feel free to think beyond chips, too: we love them with our Chicken, Cheese & Green Chile Pupusas 
[sku 75475], crispy empanadas, French fries and tater tots, or our Buffalo Style Chicken Poppers [sku 61202].  
And at the breakfast table, we're particularly partial to giving the Guacasalsa treatment to omelets, chilaquiles,

"045226","Roasted Garlic Marinara Sauce","Maybe its just us, but the smell of a luscious red sauce heating up in harmony with boiling pasta is a nostalgic 
memory of a simple dinner of yesteryear. But unlike many meals from our childhoods, a simple weeknight 
spaghetti and marinara dinner is still a staple that evokes heartiness, warmth, and family even into adulthood. 
And boy, can Trader Joe's Roasted Garlic Marinara get you there within minutes of cracking open a fresh jar.

We start with a classic tomato puree base and crank up the flavors from there; soybean oil, salt, sugar, roasted 
garlic, and plenty of parsley, basil, and oregano to be precise. A traditional whirlwind of flavors, but an ideal 
balance of each one comes together to make our Roasted Garlic Marinara as delightfully delicious as if you 
were enjoying an authentic Italian dinner during a night out on the town. But we don't require a reservation, 
suit and tie, or parking validation for this authentically Italian Roasted Garlic Marina sauce to be enjoyed. And 
don't limit yourself to pasta recipes, think of this mouthwatering Marinara as just the beginning of shakshuka,

"055306","Fall Harvest Salsa","In Spanish, salsa simply means ""sauce,"" but English speakers have adopted the term to reference a spicy, Mex-
ican-style condiment used for dipping. Maybe that's the kind of salsa you're thinking of when you hear about 
our Fall Harvest Salsa-you're probably thinking: tomatoes, onions, jalapeños; diced and mixed, ready for chip 
dipping. 

You'd only be partly right! Take your North American idea of salsa and move it north and east, to New England. 
Now flip the calendar forward to autumn. Remove those tomatoes and replace them with fire-roasted tomatillos. 
Add in some honey-roasted, heirloom Dickinson pumpkin chunks, and diced butternut squash. Balance those 
slightly spicy jalapeños with some chopped sweet apples, and pull it all together with honey, vinegar, and lime. 
We call this the ""salsification of New England¿ with a Latin twist.""

Our Fall Harvest Salsa melds fantastic fall flavors with the brightness and heat you expect from a typical salsa. 
It's the perfect balance of earthy, sweet, tangy, and spicy. Open up a jar and pair it with our Organic Blue Corn 
Tortilla Chips [sku 94583] for your football-watching friends. Invite the Mediterranean to the party when you 
spread some Fat Free Ricotta Cheese [sku 95458] on our Fig & Olive Crisps [sku 53273] with a spoonful of Fall 
Harvest Salsa on top-an amazing crostini appetizer at your next seasonal party. You could even empty an 
entire jar into a saucepan, add Organic Vegetable Broth [sku 21509], and heat it up until you have a stupendous, 
salsified, autumnal soup!

However you enjoy it, Trader Joe's Fall Harvest Salsa is an incomparable way to welcome the crisp, cool days 
of autumn. Each 12-ounce, shelf-stable jar is available on our grocery shelves for only $2.99.

"073711","Almond Chipotle Dip","Sometimes, a product comes through our tasting panel that's so fun, flavorful, and immediately habit-forming 
that we know, then and there, we have something special on our hands. Trader Joe's Almond Chipotle Dip 
is such a product. Made with a base of smooth and creamy almond butter, and flavored with smoky and 
savory seasonings like chipotle pepper powder, smoked paprika, garlic, and tamari, as soon as our panel tried 
this pleasantly peppery, vegan Dip, excitement and ideas rapidly began to spread: ""This would go great with 
something cool and crunchy, like Jicama Sticks [sku 55482]!"" ""I'd love to try this on a nice piece of BBQ Cut 
Salmon [sku 24455]..."" ""Ooh, what about on top of a Quinoa Cowboy Veggie Burger [sku 53276]?"" 

We're happy to report that all these ideas are right on the money. It's scrumptious when scooped with your 
favorite chip, cracker, or crudités (we're especially fond of using it as a supplemental sauce for our Vegetable 
Tray [sku 77630]), it's splendid as a spread on a sandwich, burger, or wrap, and it's sensational as a sauce for 
lighter proteins like poultry, fish, and tofu. And since it's vegan, it also makes a great alternative to dairy-based 
topping for homemade nachos, baked potatoes, and Battered Plant-Based Fish Fillet [sku 74251] tacos.

sauce that's become a mainstay in our grocery aisle. You might think it's just another teriyaki sauce - you'd be

veers from the everyday is in the addition of sesame seeds to the mix. The seeds add flavor and texture, setting 
Trader Joe's Soyaki quite apart from the crowd. Remember to give the bottle a good shake before using - this

Soyaki experience.

Try Trader Joe's Soyaki as a marinade for chicken, beef, pork or shrimp - the slightly sweet flavor of the sauce 
is equally delicious grilled, broiled, pan sautéed or baked. Use it as a stir-fry sauce for veggies and tofu. It makes 
a good dip for gyoza or shu mai. You may even find yourself drinking it straight from the bottle - we're not

No need to guess where we acquired this pleasing paste -just look at the title. Our Harissa Hot Chili 
Pepper Paste hails from the land where they know best how to make Harissa. And, we think our 
Tunisian supplier is the best-of-the-best. The paste is prepared in small batches with fresh, red chiles 
that are grilled in a tumbler over an open flame, and blended with a traditional mix of herbs and spices, 
including garlic, cumin, and caraway. This deep red concoction is smooth and spreadable, with a little 
smoke flavor (from the grilling), and a healthy amount of heat. Yes, it is as flavorfully divine as it sounds. 
Plus, this bold spread boasts only 10 calories, and a half-a-gram of fat per serving (one teaspoon). 

Create a traditional Tunisian dish with this Harissa atop Albacore Tuna in Olive Oil [sku 99287]. Or, enjoy this 
paste with grilled, diced Fresh Organic Chicken Breast [sku  63550], and Garbanzo Beans [sku 20829]. For a 
flavorful dip with a kick, stir some Harissa into our Smooth & Creamy Classic Hummus [sku 93590]. This is one

"074550","Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce","A hot sauce needs more than just heat to be great. A truly great hot sauce-and we're talking about the kind you 
can put on absolutely anything-needs to strike a balance between its savory, tart, textural, and spicy elements. 
And we're here to tell you today that Trader Joe's Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce is a truly great hot 
sauce. Inside each bottle, Jalapeño and Garlic work hand in glove to produce a flavor profile that effortlessly 
balances savory and spicy, salty and sour, chunky and pourable, all in a way that makes it a marvelous match 
for tacos, eggs, nachos, potatoes, and pretty much anything else that could use an extra kick of flavor.

Made with a base of puréed, brined jalapeños and garlic grown in Gilory, CA (the ""Garlic Capital of the World,"" 
no less!) our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce's relatively thick consistency, captivating aromatics, and 
steady, building heat all work together in harmony to create a consummate catch-all condiment. We especially 
like it over something warm and crispy, like a basket of freshly air-fried Seasoned Waffle Cut Fries [sku 73594]. 
Another hot tip: Our Chunky Garlic & Jalapeño Hot Sauce may just be your new best friend at the breakfast 
table. Try it on omelettes, homemade chilaquiles, a well-stacked breakfast sandwich, or even avocado toast.

"076472","Roasted Red Pepper Hummus","We do our best to remain humble about our hummus selection, but it's not always easy-especially when we 
have humdingers like Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper Hummus among our ranks. Made with a base of 
creamy, puréed chickpeas and sesame seeds, as well as a bit of sunflower oil and sea salt, our supplier finishes 
each batch with with a helping of rich, flavorful, roasted red peppers to tie it all together. Every bite is superbly 
savory and terrifically smooth-textured-the kind of hummus to leave you humming with excitement all day.

An ideal companion to Pita Chips [sku 91053], crackers, carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, or pretty much anything 
that'll serve as a scoop, to be honest, Trader Joe's Roasted Red Pepper Hummus makes a great midday snack, 
pre-meal appetizer, or party hors d'oeuvre. We also find that its creamy consistency and delightfully peppery 
notes make it especially suited for spreading on sandwiches and wraps, and even more so when the sandwiches 
and wraps in question prominently feature other roasted veggies. And for a full (and full-flavored) meal, make 
our Roasted Red Pepper Hummus part of a Mediterranean-style meze plate, along with other favorites like our

"068663","Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce","Ginger is so utterly unique in its flavor, aroma, and even the physical sensations it creates in the mouth, that it 
almost feels like a culinary gift from nature itself. It's honestly hard to imagine what global cuisine would look 
like (or, more importantly, taste like) without this singularly scrumptious root. And now, there's an easy way to 
incorporate its inimitable flavor profile to any dish you wish: Trader Joe's Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce combines 
the savory, herby sensations of ginger with the rich sweetness of coconut sugar, a touch of pickled garlic, and 
just a bit of soy sauce to make one seriously versatile condiment. You get sweet, spicy, salty, and garlicky - all 
in a single sauce.

Made especially for us by a trusted supplier in Thailand, this Sweet Ginger Sauce is practically perfect for 
serving with a plate of pan-fried Pork Gyoza [sku 10602], but that's hardly where we'd stop. In fact, we find that 
its sweet, ginger-y heat makes for excellent dunking with all kinds of savory, meaty dishes, including chicken 
skewers, samosas, or crispy fried shrimp. Of course, we haven't forgotten plant-based options: try pouring a bit  
of our Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce over garlic-fried rice or sautéed Tempeh [sku 99125], or mix with a bit of olive 
oil and vinegar for a sweet, snappy salad dressing.

"045029","Tomato Basil Marinara Sauce","Basil has a strong association with two very different culinary cultures; In Southeast Asia (particularly Thailand), 
a bolder, spicier basil is common, while in Italy, a sweeter version enhances many popular dishes. Trader Giotto's 
Tomato Basil Marinara is our personal ode to the flavor of sweet basil as it's so often enjoyed in its Italian 
context.

Ironically, neither tomatoes, nor basil originate in Italy. Tomatoes made their way eastward to Europe as late 
as the 16th century, when Spanish explorers brought newly discovered tomato plants back home from the 
Americas. Basil came westward, from India, via the ancient spice route. But, distant origins won't change the 
fact that tomatoes and basil taste like they are made for Marinara-like frescoes are made for the Sistine Chapel.

Giotto's Tomato Basil Marinara incorporates the usual suspects: tomato puree, tomatoes, oil (extra virgin olive 
and soybean), salt, sugar, garlic, onions, and spices (parsley and oregano, in addition to the basil). We've cooked 
everything down to a smooth, slightly chunky sauce that has a bright tomato taste, accented by moderate basil 
notes. Heat it 'as is' and serve over spaghetti, penne, or any kind of pasta. (Thai rice noodles might make an 
interesting partner!) Use it as a simmer sauce for chicken breasts or meatballs. Or, let it be the starting point for 
your own sauce-creation. So many different ways to enjoy this sauce. 

Each 26-ounce jar of Trader Giotto's Basil Marinara is just $1.79. Find it in our grocery aisle. (If it happens to 
be next to our Thai Red Curry Simmer Sauce [sku 57474] on the shelf, that's pure coincidence.) ...

"074462","Buttermilk Ranch Dressing","Since its invention in the middle of the 20th century, ranch has taken on a culinary life of its own. In addition 
to its status as the best-selling style of salad dressing in the U.S. for over three decades, it's also earned the 
title of best-selling condiment in the U.S. in recent years-even more so than ketchup! Beloved for how well 
its creamy, herby flavor profile enhances French fries, carrot sticks, chicken wings, pizza, and everything in 
between, ranch is a powerhouse of ""put-it-on-everything"" practicality, and Trader Joe's Buttermilk Ranch 
Dressing ably demonstrates why.

Each bottle is made with a classic recipe that starts with a base of cultured buttermilk, sour cream, and 
mayonnaise, and flavored with an array of aromatic herbs and seasonings including garlic, chives, dill, and 
shallots. Cool, creamy, and delightfully old-fashioned, our Buttermilk Ranch serves spectacularly well in 
a salad with nearly any leafy green [though we're particularly partial to one made with Butter Lettuce [sku 
94470]. Unsurprisingly, it also makes an excellent dip, condiment, or spread for all kinds of savory snacks, 
appetizers, or sandwiches, respectively. What might surprise you, however, is the fact that even with its rich, 
creamy consistency, each two-tablespoon serving contains only 70 calories.

"093920","Pico de Gallo Salsa Mild","Also known in its native home of Mexico as ""Salsa Bandera"" (after the red, green, and white of the Mexican 
flag), pico de gallo is an icon in its own right: a perennial favorite for parties, a necessary accessory to nachos, 
and an absolute essential for any taco Tuesday (or taco any-other-day-of-the-week, for that matter.) Trader 
Joe's Mild Pico De Gallo is an edible tribute to this scion of salsas, an easy option for when you need fresh pico 
de gallo, but don't quite have the time for all that chopping.

Made in the classic style using diced tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, cilantro, and lemon juice, our Pico De Gallo 
isn't just an ideal companion to tortilla chips, it's also an excellent (and easy) recipe enhancer. Looking to spice 
up a bit of pan-fried fish? A layer of chunky Pico De Gallo will add just the right amount of zest. Making a quick 
Tex-Mex queso? Simply add a tub of Trader Joe's Mild Pico De Gallo to a skillet of melted cheese and milk, and 
you're there, compadre. Scrambled eggs, omelets, breakfast burritos - pretty much any savory breakfast you can 
name could do with a little Pico De Gallo, too.

In addition to being a great convenience, Trader Joe's Mild Pico De Gallo Salsa is also a great value. You'll find

our pasta sauce set: Trader Joe's Calabrian Chili Spicy Pasta Sauce!

Our Calabrian Chili Spicy Pasta Sauce offers a pleasant kick of flavor thanks to the Calabrian Chili hot sauce 
emulsified in its classic tomato base. Beautifully balanced with a touch of honey, the Chilis are also responsible 
for the Sauce's striking orange hue. It's an exceptionally thick Sauce that manages to be creamy without the use 
of actual cream, with the power to coat a plethora of pasta shapes with ease. Try tossing it with our Pappardelle

"054173","Garlic Spread Dip","We love to develop flavorful, time-saving products. We also love to invent words and descriptors to categorize 
said products. Since we couldn't definitively declare this mousse-like, garlicky masterpiece a spread or a dip, and 
we didn't want to pigeonhole it into one usage versus another, the solution was simple: we dubbed it Trader Joe's 
Garlic Spread-Dip!

This kicky Garlic Spread-Dip has its origins in Middle Eastern cuisine, where it's called toum (say ""toom""), the 
Arabic word for garlic. Fresh garlic cloves, canola oil, salt and lemon juice are slowly blended together to create 
an emulsion, which sounds simple in theory, but is actually a time-and-effort intensive process to ensure the oil 
and lemon juice are properly incorporated. And as anyone who's attempted to make mayonnaise or hollandaise 
sauce from scratch can attest, the finished product doesn't always turn out as intended.  With Trader Joe's Garlic 
Spread-Dip, the hard work is done for you, so you can just open the container, scoop and eat.

The versatility of this Spread-Dip cannot be overstated - simply use it anywhere you desire a creamy, bracing 
kick of garlic flavor. Serve it as a dip with French fries. Baste it on roast chicken or grilled meats. Slather it on 
hamburgers or hot dogs. Feel free to go outside the suggested spread-dip application and add a healthy dollop 
to pasta sauces, soups or salad dressings or extra zing. You'll be happy you did.

You may want to brace your taste buds, but there's no need to brace your wallet. We're selling each eight ounce 
tub of this intensely flavorful Garlic Spread-Dip for a WOW price of $2.99, everyday.

"074903","Sweet Cannoli Dip","There's a time-honored saying that ""it's what's on the inside that counts"", and that's especially true if you happen 
to be talking about a superlatively sweet, cream-filled pastry. Taking this axiom to heart, we've created a dip 
that's entirely inspired by what's on the inside of a classic Italian dessert: introducing Trader Joe's Sweet Cannoli 
Dip! Made with a base of cream cheese, sour cream, and ricotta, every bite of this delectable dessert Dip is 
remarkably rich, with sweet, vanilla-tinged, ever-so-slightly tart notes and a velvety, frosting-like consistency 
 just like what you'd find within a freshly baked cannoli.

Freed from the confines of its traditional, crispy, pastry shell, Trader Joe's Sweet Cannoli Dip can be enjoyed 
in any situation that calls for something extra sweet. Try it as a spread on crackers or short cake, as a layer in a 
super luxurious trifle, or mixed with chopped fresh berries and melon for a full-flavored fruit salad. Of course, 
our favorite way to indulge might be the one most tied to its inspiration: as a dip with crispy, crunchy, Belgian

"074211","Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Almond Pesto Sauce","Our Genova Pesto [sku 15759] salutes the very first pesto sauce that has its roots in northern Italy. Like the 
original, our Genova is garlicky, cheesy, and nutty, with a vibrant green hue owed to the fresh basil that's been 
pounded together with oil and other ingredients to create a delectable pasta partner. But the word ""pesto"" 
really just means ""to pound, or crush"" (in the Ligurian language of the Middle Ages), which seems to open up 
a world of possibilities. Taking the implicit cue, we've applied this namesake technique to a different group of 
ingredients, calling the final product: Trader Joe's Organic Roasted Red Pepper and Almond Pesto Sauce. 

While there is still some basil in this Pesto, the real star of the show is Organic Roasted Red (Bell) Peppers. 
These are crushed with organic PDO Pecorino Romano cheese, organic almonds, organic onions, organic 
garlic, and a handful of organic herbs and spices, including marjoram, basil, and paprika. These ingredients 
are artfully emulsified with a combination of organic extra virgin olive oil and organic sunflower oil. The final 
flavors are delicately fine-tuned with touches of organic cane sugar, and organic apple cider vinegar.

Although the fiery red-orange color of our Organic Roasted Red Pepper Pesto may look completely different 
from the pesto of the Genoese, the concept and application is very familiar. Simply take spoonfuls of this rich, 
roasted, cheesy, nutty, flavorful Sauce and toss it with your favorite cooked Trader Joe's pasta shape. One taste 
and we think you'll agree-Trader Joe's is totally crushing it in the pesto game!

With its bespeckled, red-orange hue, not only does this Sauce look like fall, but it tastes like fall, too. You'll 
find plenty of creamy, savory Pumpkin flavor, accented with classic warming spices, like cinnamon, ginger, 
nutmeg, allspice, and clove. You'll also note its serious depth and complexity, thanks to tangy apple cider 
vinegar, sweet molasses, and, of course, smoky Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. 

This stellar Sauce is made for us by the same supplier that makes our Magnificsauce [sku 69916]-so you already 
know just how magnificent their sauce-making skills are. Try coating some Baby Cauliflower [sku 66248] or 
Organic Mini Sweet Peppers [sku 57202] with this seasonal Sauce before roasting them in a hot oven. Use it as a 
marinade for chicken or pork that you can then shred for an aromatic, taco filling. Or add some autumnal flair 
to your next pasta night by adding a touch of cream to the Sauce and tossing with Organic Cascatelli Pasta [sku 
72471]. We're selling each 14.5-ounce jar for $3.49, while we can keep it in stock. Happy roasting!

"073082","Organic Artichoke Pasta Sauce","There's a new pasta sauce gracing our grocery shelves, and this one is a piece of art-artichoke, that is. Trader 
Joe's Organic Artichoke Sauce is a thick and creamy Sauce, made with Italian ricotta, Parmigiano Reggiano, 
and tender, chopped Artichokes. Our supplier is located in Puglia, Italy-an area  celebrated for their artichokes. 
And not only is our supplier 100% Organic, they even grow and harvest the artichokes themselves. 

For a weeknight meal masterpiece that comes together in minutes, use our Organic Artichoke Sauce as the 
paint to a blank canvas of your favorite noodles. Simply heat the sauce, add a couple spoonfuls of pasta water, 
then toss in your cooked noodles of choice. The pasta water will help the Sauce coat each and every noodle, so 
each bite has an excellent composition of noodle to sauce. And while this is, first and foremost, a Pasta Sauce, 
consider some other tasty applications-atop a pizza, roasted with veggies, or baked with Shredded Mozzarella 
[sku 81085] and served as a dip.

"073246","Gochujang Paste","With origins dating to at least the 1600s, and possibly earlier, gochujang isn't so much an ingredient as it is an 
institution of Korean cuisine unto itself. Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, 
salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that's 
a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe's Gochujang, we reached out to a 
supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor 
profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, 
a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more.

Our Gochujang's beautifully balanced elements of sweet and heat make it an excellent choice for flavoring 
proteins of all kinds, from barbecued beef to pan-seared porkloin, crispy fried chicken wings to hearty tofu 
stew. It can spice up burgers when used as a spread, can be enjoyed with french fries either on its own or 
mixed with mayo, and adds a whole new dimension of flavor when added to noodle soups. And for a fun, fiery 
appetizer, it's great for making kimchi-inspired quick pickles with salted smashed cucumbers.

way. It's an a-maizing condiment, beginning with a base of sweet corn, and blended with finely diced red bell 
peppers, onions, jalapeño peppers, and a bit of sugar. By ""a base of sweet corn,"" we mean, ""lots and lots of sweet 
corn."" As in, 1.8 ears of corn in every jar - we have taken them off their cobs to make them fit. (We've sold 
enough of this salsa that over time, this has added up to more than 41,313,173 ears of corn.) It has a little kick, 
but it's not what we'd call hot. 

Pile it into tacos or burritos, scoop it up with Organic Corn Dippers [sku 92482], spoon it over salads or chili or 
soup, use it as a dip for veggies, fold it into scrambled eggs, serve it as a side dish with grilled chicken or fish, 
blend it into Queso Dip [99262], or even use it in place of traditional relish on a hot dog.

"059821","Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto","In modern cuisine, ""pesto"" is often used to describe any number of ingredients finely chopped and blended 
together into a sauce or paste. Traditionally, though, pesto is a combination of fresh basil, nuts, garlic, Parmesan 
cheese and oil-and it's delicious. But what about our vegan and dairy-averse friends? Why shouldn't they be 
able to enjoy the creamy, green luxury that is traditional pesto? We think they should, so we've gone and created 
a real deli-section delight: fresh Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto. 

Trader Joe's Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto is a simple blend of-surprise, surprise-kale, cashew butter, 
and basil, mixed together with olive oil, lemon juice, and water, then seasoned with garlic, salt, and pepper. The 
kale gives the Pesto some serious depth, the basil infuses it with freshness, and the cashew butter lends it enough 
creaminess to leave you saying, ""Parmesan? Who needs Parmesan?!"" Exaaaactly. 

In addition to being delicious, Trader Joe's Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto is also impressively versatile. 
Toss it with your favorite TJ's pasta. Use it as a dip for chips, crackers, and crudités. Spread it on a sandwich or 
in a wrap. Luckily, this Pesto is delicious regardless of your dietary preferences, and omnivores can feel free to 
use Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto as a marinade for chicken or a topping for fish.  

The only time we've seen pesto in this format outside of a vegan restaurant, it was going for $9.99 per pound. At 
Trader Joe's, however, we believe in spending a little green to get a lot of green, so we're selling each 8-ounce tub 
of Trader Joe's Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto for $3.69. You'll find it in our deli cases.

"074314","Ube Spread","One way to describe ube: a purple-hued yam popular and most often grown in the Philippines. Another way 
to describe ube: a unique flavor (and color!) that has captivated our customers for several years and counting. 
Truth be told, ube is both of these things, and this summer, we're offering yet another sweet way to scratch that 
ube itch: Trader Joe's Ube Spread.

True to its name, our Ube Spread boasts ube purée as its first ingredient, which means it goes big on the 
distinct, craveable, coconut-meets-pistachio Ube flavor. Butter, cream, and coconut cream gives it its smooth, 
buttery texture; cane sugar sweetens the deal; and sea salt brings out even more of the Spread's yummy, yammy 
flavor. Its eye-catching purple hue originates from the ube itself, but we've stepped-up the saturation with a 
splash of purple carrot juice, making it a pretty-in-purple sight for both your peepers and your palate alike!

Spread Ube Spread on toasted TJ's Braided & Sliced Brioche [sku 71239], waffles, or pancakes. Incorporate it 
into baked goods. Spoon it over scoops of ice cream-even TJ's Ube Ice Cream [sku 61854]. There's not much

"073469","Truffle Flavored BBQ Sauce","We ask: why does truffle pair so well with such a wide variety of flavors? Is it the fact that its rich, enchanting 
aroma tends to wake up the finer details of a dish? Is it the fact that its unique, intensely umami-forward profile 
gives your taste buds something new to work against a familiar flavor? Or is it just because it's, well, simply 
delicious? The truth is, likely, a mix of all three-or, at the very least, all three are easily evident in Trader 
Joe's Truffle Flavored BBQ Sauce, the newest entry (and dare we say, one of the tastiest yet) into our seasonal 
summer truffle lineup.

Starting with a bold, smoky, classic BBQ base of sugar, tomato, and vinegar, our supplier adds a suite of savory 
seasonings including garlic, oregano, cumin, cinnamon, and, of course, bits of black summer truffle. The 
resulting Sauce is delectably spicy, satisfyingly sweet (but not too sweet), and rich with those ineffably umami 
notes that only truffle can provide. We especially like it served on something savory and juicy, like a rack of ribs 
or a hot-off-the-grill Organic Beef Hot Dog [sku 57562].

Truffle Aioli delivers a dose of decadence wherever it's spread, offering a powerhouse of flavor for everyone 
to enjoy-and it's emulsified without eggs, making it a vegan-friendly option for your imminent summer 
cookouts, barbecues, and picnics. 

It makes a terrifically creamy dip for Patio Potato Chips [sku 62977] or your favorite veggie crudités. Slather it

Real strawberry purée and strawberry juice concentrate are combined with a touch of cane sugar to accentuate 
the sweet, fruit-forward profile of this vegan Vinaigrette, while fragrant basil and tart lemon juice concentrate 
provide balance with herbal, zesty notes. It's all layered on a backdrop of tangy, white balsamic vinegar and 
expeller-pressed canola oil-the use of this neutral oil allows the Strawberry Basil flavors to truly shine. Splash 
it on a classic spinach salad with freshly sliced strawberries, Crumbled Goat Cheese [sku 76929], and walnuts; 
or over a platter of sliced beefsteak tomatoes and Burrata [sku 98671]. Or, steer it into more savory territory

mustard with the snappy, herbaceous kick of a well-dilled pickle via the addition of natural pickle flavoring, 
dill weed, and actual diced-up pickle pieces. Together, these elements form a superbly summer-y sauce that's

"073649","Chimichurri Sauce","A certified staple of Argentinian and Uruguayan cooking, chimichurri is savory, herbaceous, refreshing, and 
richly aromatic, all at once - truly a consummate condiment, if ever there was one. Though its precise origins 
are somewhat disputed, food historians generally agree that it rose to prominence as part of Argentinian ranch 
cuisine, likely sometime in the 19th century, primarily as a way to season grilled beef. Since then, as Trader 
Joe's Chimichurri Sauce deftly demonstrates, its uses have expanded to include sandwiches and seafood, 
burgers and kebabs, pastas and potatoes - pretty much anything that's savory and delicious will be even more 
so with a bit of Chimichurri on top.

Starting with a mix of finely chopped parsely and cilantro, our supplier adds in minced garlic, dried cumin, and 
crushed red pepper, then blends in a mix of oil and vinegar. The resulting Sauce is a compellingly complex mix 
of herby aromatics, savory spice, silky texture, and even a delicately tart note that serves to wake up the flavors 
within any entrée it's added to. We especially like it with grilled shrimp on crispy crostini, al pastor tacos with 
charred pineapple, roasted sweet potatoes with crumbled cotjia, or, of course, a freshly seared steak.

"073435","Organic Vegan Nacho Dip","Vegan cheese has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time - it wasn't too long ago that the idea 
of non-dairy nachos was more or less unheard of. However, thanks to plant-based powerhouses like cashew 
and coconut, which are especially adept at mimicking the texture of melted cheese, it's easier than ever to enjoy 
savory, cheesy treats without the use of animal products. Case in point: Trader Joe's Organic Vegan Nacho 
Dip. Soft, spreadable, and decidedly dairy-free, it conjurs all the same familiar flavors of a classic nacho dip, 
while being made from entirely organic, plant-based, and - we ought to mention - gluten free ingredients.

Equally delicious when enjoyed as snack, sauce, or spread, our Organic Vegan Nacho Dip can be enjoyed 
straight out of the fridge with your favorite tortilla chip, cracker, or crudité, but we like it even better after it's 
been warmed in the microwave for a minute or so. It can be used to make your own dairy-free nachos at home 
by simply melting and pouring the contents over a plate of Restaurant Style White Corn Tortilla Chips [sku 
58073] and sliced jalapeños, or as a condiment for other dishes. Try spooning a bit of warm Dip into your next

With a recipe that's more than 50% jalapeños, this is a sauce that's hot without being overwhelmingly spicy, 
smooth and creamy without any dairy (in fact, it's vegan!). Drizzle it over eggs for breakfast or employ it as a 
replacement for traditional enchilada sauce in an enchilada bake at dinnertime. Of course, chips are improved

fruity flavor profile, lively level of heat (they tend to run 2,500-5,000 Scovilles, akin to a jalapeño), and overall 
versatility. They're made from dried mirasol peppers, and are most often prepared by being rehydrated, then 
pulverized or puréed for use in moles, marinades, or salsas, like the kind you'll find in every jar of Trader Joe's 
Guajillo Salsa. Starting with a base of ripe, juicy tomatoes, our supplier seasons each batch with a blend of 
guajillo purée, red chili flakes, and garlic, then finishes it with a bit of chipotle pepper powder to add a soft, 
smoky edge to its steady, satisfying spice.

Just like its namesake pepper, Trader Joe's Guajillo Salsa makes a remarkably versatile addition to any pantry. 
It makes a great first course for taco night when enjoyed with tortilla chips, an ideal condiment for tacos, 
burritos, and fajitas, and even an excellent ingredient in chilis, soups, and queso dips. We find that its zesty 
profile and balanced notes of sweet, smoke, and spice make it a particularly excellent salsa for savory breakfast 
dishes, like huevos rancheros or a hearty breakfast burrito.

Curry Sauce, we've honored the modern recipe of a zesty, chili-forward red curry with red chili puree, and of 
course tons of onions, garlic and ginger! Each jar contains a delicate blend of the fragrance and flavors of these 
ingredients all laced together with creamy coconut milk. With this sauce you can make a traditional red curry 
dish in no time! Cook up some meat, poultry, tofu, or veggies until done, stir in our Thai Red Curry Sauce, 
simmer until heated through, and serve on a bed of rice.

"072128","Tamarind Sauce","Beloved the world over for its unique mix of sweet and sour, the tamarind is a powerhouse of flavor. It's an 
essential ingredient in a wide range of global cuisines, including those of India, the Philippines, and Mexico, 
and can be employed in a truly impressive array of dishes, including curries, candies, stir-fries, soups, cocktails, 
and barbecue glazes. As tribute to this treasure of tropical climes, we now offer Trader Joe's Tamarind Sauce, 
a condiment that's as uncommonly versatile as the fruit that inspired it.

On its own, our rich, tangy Tamarind Sauce makes a great dip for savory appetizers like our Vegetable Samosas 
[sku 61534] or Kaula Pork Spring Rolls [sku 70655], and can even be served over simple dishes like steamed rice 
or veggie noodles to take them to a whole new level. But that's hardly where we'd stop: it also adds a uniquely 
tart twist when mixed into a homemade curry, brushed over a salmon fillet, or blended into a quick vinaigrette. 
Try it on a plate of crispy chicken wings or grilled chicken thighs for something truly special.

condiment ever have a partner to help in the ongoing fight against flavorless foods?"" Wonder no longer, Trader 
Joe's Incredisauce is here!

While Magnifisauce has a kind of relish-y profile, Incredisauce is more like honey-mustard. Mustard is 
blended with egg yolks, garlic and onion powders, cane sugar, lemon juice, and a hint of natural smoke flavor. 
The resulting sauce is golden-yellow, with a thick and creamy texture, and a super balance of tangy and sweet 
flavors, plus just a hint of smokiness. 

It's a dynamic dipping sauce for Trader Joe's Chicken Drummellas [sku 15791] or Gluten Free Breaded Chicken 
Breast Nuggets [sku 52805]. It also adds verve when spread on hot or cold sandwiches. Quinoa Cowboy Veggie

Dressing offers all the satisfying flavor and smooth texture of a classically creamy dressing, but does so without 
the use of any animal products. Starting from a base of cauliflower, almond butter, and vinegar, our supplier 
builds up an amazingly herby flavor profile via the addition of garlic, shallots, parsley,  and chives, then finishes 
it off with distinctively aromatic dill. The result is one exquisitely silky Vegan Dressing that can be used on 
salads and sandwiches, or enjoyed as a dipping sauce for all kinds of snacks.

Since this Creamy Dill Dressing is so veritably Vegan, it opens a whole world of opportunities for those on 
plant-based diets and omnivores alike. It can be a dip for carrot sticks and other crudités, as well as a sauce for 
Chicken Nuggets [sku 52805]. It can be used to top a freshly baked potato, as well as a perfectly roasted salmon 
fillet. And of course, it also adds a refreshing, herby note to any salad it's tossed with. If you ever find yourself

"071498","Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole","It's tough to beat homemade guacamole  - but Trader Joe's Organic Chunky Homestyle Guacamole certainly 
gives it a run for its money. Made with all organic ingredients, including rough-cut hunks of Hass avocados, 
tender tomatoes, and chopped onions, our supplier mixes them all together with a bit of lime, diced jalapeño, 
and cilantro to give it a zesty, creamy, oh-so-snackable flavor, as well as a smooth, yet chunky, just-like-
homemade texture. In every sense, this is truly, wholly, Guacamole.

When enjoyed with chips, this Organic Guacamole is the breakout star of any snack table: its charmingly 
chunky consistency lends itself particularly well to holding onto tortilla chips, as well as giving you that soft, 
perfectly ripe avocado texture with every bite. But that's hardly the end of this Guacamole's gastronomic 
utility. We also adore it spread on a crispy slice of sourdough for easy avocado toast, scooped into sandwiches 
or fish tacos, or incorporated into an at-home burrito bowl.

"059248","Organic Hummus","Hummus, simply meaning ""chickpeas"" in Arabic, is a staple of the Trader Joe's fresh dip refrigerators. While we 
love to toy with the classic chickpea-based spread and make funky, creative additions, none are more pure than 
a newly opened container of Trader Joe's Organic Hummus. 

Our supplier starts with the star of the show: our favorite nutty legume, the chickpea, and blends it into an 
incredibly creamy base for its supporting acts. A couple spoonfuls of sesame tahini, a splash of oils, garlic and 
lemon to add tang to the sweet chickpea blend, and salt and cumin round out the pure, organic ingredient list. 
Don't allow the unassuming, beige dip basking in its re-sealable bowl fool you, Trader Joe's Organic Hummus 
is a classic that is far more than the sum of its parts. This proprietary blend of these age-old ingredients has us 
salivating for that next dollop of Organic Hummus. So much so that we may just double dip when no one's

"064204","Chocolate Hummus","Our Customers love chocolate, and our Customers love hummus¿but Chocolate Hummus?! Admittedly, we 
were skeptical. The idea of a dessert hummus being anything more than ""interesting"" seemed unlikely-and 
while we're all for ""interesting,"" our products have to actually taste good, too. Like, really good. And, to our great 
surprise, Chocolate Hummus does, in fact, taste really good.

Made from a standard base of cooked chickpeas, tahini, expeller pressed canola oil, & sea salt, Trader Joe's 
Chocolate Hummus is, texturally speaking, just like any other smooth & creamy hummus-it's even made for us 
by a vendor that produces a few of our ""regular"" hummus varieties. Flavor-wise, however, Chocolate Hummus 
presents a whole new world.  We've swapped the savory for the sweet-instead of garlic, roasted red peppers, 
eggplant, or any of the other typical hummus mix-ins, we've added in cane sugar, cocoa, & a bit of natural flavor 
in their place. The result is a sweet-but-not-too-sweet, chocolate-y spread with subtle sesame undertone...that's 
headed straight for the TJ's Hummus Hall of Fame!

Enjoy Trader Joe's Chocolate Hummus by the spoonful, or devour it as a dip for Organic Sliced Apples [sku

Your shopping cart. A classic combination, not unlike a bountiful blend of garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, 
and garlic. 

But what makes our traditional hummus different? First, consistency. Mediterranean Hummus is super 
smooth and creamy, a bit more ""whipped"" than many of our other hummus choices. The texture of hummus 
tends to be different depending on where in the world it originates, so it makes sense for us to offer some of 
that variety in our stores. We've also taken the liberty of topping Trader Joe's Mediterranean Hummus with 
crunchy pine nuts, and a bright blend of parsley, red bell pepper, and olive oil which creates a distinctive flavor 
and texture profile we think you'll really enjoy. Of course, it's also mighty delicious - then again, this isn't a 
difference at all, because we think all of our hummus options (hummi?) are delicious.

"059991","Green Goddess Salad Dressing","There was a time when a salad was a bowl of lettuce, and dressing was a simple mix of oil and vinegar. Thank-
fully, from our perspective, that time has passed. Salads take myriad forms - sometimes there's no lettuce at 
all - and dressings include flavors that wouldn't have been possible to imagine ""back in the day."" A recent look 
at the dressing offerings in our refrigerated cases, though, didn't reflect this evolution. Sure, we had some in-
teresting flavors, but we realized we'd had more or less the same salad dressings in our case for years and years 
and years. It was time for some updating. Luckily for us (and you!), it was right about this time that we made 
the acquaintance of a terrific new salad dressing supplier in Wisconsin.

One of three in a lineup of new dressings is Trader Joe's Green Goddess Salad Dressing. A heavenly green 
hue, as its name suggests, this vibrant salad accompaniment is packed with Hass avocados, fresh herbs like 
basil, and chives, and seasonings that include green onions, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. Most refrigerated 
dressings are heat pasteurized for safety. That's great for safety; not so great for maintaining the fresh flavors 
of otherwise raw foods. Our supplier uses a process called HPP (that stands for High Pressure Processing), 
which uses very cold water and very high pressure to achieve the same food safety results, without cooking 
the ingredients. The result is  a dressing with big, bold, bright flavors, and only 20 calories per serving!

We're selling Green Goddess Salad Dressing in an 11 ounce bottle for $3.69, a terrific everyday price for this 
vegan, no added sugars dressing of distinction. You'll find it in our refrigerated case.

"068135","Pesto Rosso","Our Pesto alla Genovese [sku 44947] has long been a customer favorite. While this style of pesto comes from 
Genoa (it's in the name!), our Trader Joe's Pesto Rosso brings the tradition of red, Sicilian pesto to our grocery 
shelves.

Our Italian supplier uses tomatoes as the foundation, with sunflower oil, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and some 
basil-though not as much basil as one would find in green pesto. Pine nuts, typical of Genoese pesto, are 
exchanged for cashews in our Pesto Rosso. Carrot purée pumps up the red-orange color, while also adding 
some subtle sweetness.

Pesto Rosso has a saucy, spreadable texture that is great for topping a toasted baguette, or a homemade pizza. 
Use some spoonfuls to enhance the flavor of your minestrone, or vegetable soup. Of course, tossing this red 
Pesto with your favorite hot pasta is a must!

"062480","Crunchy Chili Onion","While most condiments have very specific applications, there are a select few that take on a more universal 
appeal. We all know someone who likes to put ketchup on everything, or that sees sriracha as a one-sauce-fits-all 
solution. Well, we're here today to introduce yet another condiment contender to the ""great on everything"" hall 
of fame: made from a smoky, savory mixture of crunchy garlic, onion, peppers and olive oil, Trader Joe's Chili 
Onion Crunch is now available for all of your savory seasoning needs - and we do mean all of them! 

Similar to the jars of chili oil with crunchy garlic you can find on the table of many Chinese restaurants, the genius 
of Chili Onion Crunch is in its simplicity: with just a handful of simple ingredients, it creates a remarkably deep 
flavor profile that manages to accentuate the flavors of anything else it's placed on. The crispy, crunchy, dried 
garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes 
build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the 
olive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all 
the other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning.

Which brings us to its application: we happily contend that Chili Onion Crunch truly does taste great on 
everything. Pizzas, burgers, burritos, hummus - anything and everything that you'd add hot sauce, steak sauce, or 
even just salt and pepper to, will benefit greatly from Chili Onion Crunch. Seriously: hot dogs, pasta, omelettes, 
chow mein - we really could keep going. We haven't tried it on ice cream yet, but we're certainly not ruling it out. 

Of course, at Trader Joe's, the spice that always goes with everything is value, so we're proud to say that Trader 
Joe's Chili Onion Crunch works well with that, too: we're selling six-ounce jars for $3.99, every day. You'll find 
them in our grocery aisle.

"071835","Truffle Piccante Spicy Pasta Sauce","Last year, we introduced a spicy, savory Truffle Hot Sauce [sku 68444] to our holiday lineup, which not only 
proved to be a certified hit among our customers, it also proved a point: that truffles and spice go hand in hand. 
With this point in mind, we're excited to introduce Trader Joe's Truffle Piccante Spicy Pasta Sauce to this 
year's holiday lineup. It's made with a mix of rich, zesty tomatoes, spicy Calabrian chilis, and boldly flavorful 
bits of Italian black truffle, which combine to create a Pasta Sauce that's compellingly spicy and complex, yet 
artfully balanced.

Whether you enjoy it spread over a crispy eggplant Parmesan, mixed into a righteous ratatouille, or simply 
tossed with your favorite noodles, this Truffle Piccante Pasta Sauce is a powerhouse of flavor. Each bite 
starts with the intoxicating aroma of umami-rich truffles, which is followed by the tang of its tomato base, 
and finally ends on a moderate heat that steadily builds over time. In other words, an ideal Pasta Sauce for 
warming you up during the cold winter months.

"063682","Black Truffle Alfredo Pasta Sauce","On its own, Alfredo Sauce is rich, creamy, and cheesy, an undisputed icon of comfort food. So how could we 
possibly improve upon it? By adding truffle, of course! (Honestly, it seems obvious, now that we're saying it 
out loud.) With Trader Joe's Black Truffle Alfredo Pasta Sauce, we've taken something flavorful and luxuri-
ous and given it an even fancier upgrade. 

Starting with a full-flavored Alfredo made with savory grated Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano cheese, 
we add real pieces of black summer truffle-just enough to evoke the earthy, umami essence of truffle with-
out overpowering the sauce's creaminess. Use it to make your favorite comfort foods even more extravagant, 
like in a white lasagna with hints of truffle, as an upscale substitute for pizza sauce, or for a truffle-tinged 
twist on classic fettuccine Alfredo. 

While you might expect to pay top dollar for such luxury, we're happy to report that each 14.5 ounce jar of 
Trader Joe's Black Truffle Alfredo Sauce sells for the decidedly non-upscale price of $3.99. We think that's 
pretty comforting, too.

These fun, fungi components are suspended in a smooth oil blend, with some pine nuts added for crunch (and 
for pesto credibility). It's finished with chopped Italian parsley, sea salt, and black pepper, creating a Pesto that

"070096","Peri Peri Sauce","Depending on your tolerance for heat, a good hot sauce can be one of the most versatile tools in your kitchen. 
Some hot sauces, however, go beyond versatility to reach indispensability. That's certainly the case for Trader 
Joe's Peri-Peri Sauce, a one-sauce-fits-all condiment that combines the welcoming heat of fermented chilies 
and dried chili flakes, the tangy tartness of lemon juice, and the savory splendor of garlic to create a uniquely 
enchanting flavor profile that genuinely goes with everything. It's spicy, a little sour, even a little sweet, and has 
a smooth, creamy texture that keeps you coming back for more, bite after bite.

Made for us by a supplier in South Africa, where peri-peri peppers are plentiful, this curiously complex Peri-
Peri Sauce has an uncanny ability to not just match well with other foods, but to wake up and augment their 
flavors as well. From roasted chicken, to pork chops, to beer-battered fish, a nice drizzle of Peri-Peri can help 
bring out the inherent sweetness and depth of flavor to practically any protein. But that's not all: it adds a new 
dimension to roasted veggies, tater tot nachos, and jackfruit tacos, it provides a delightful kick to fried rice, 
potato salad, or hummus, and makes an ideal dipping sauce for fried pickles, calamari, or tofu nuggets.

pectin (a plant-based thickener). Nothing else is added. This combination and method yields the most tempting

"099343","Whole Grain Dijon Mustard","As classic a condiment as can be, dijon mustard was popularized in the mid-19th century, after an enterprising 
chef in Dijon, France augmented his mustard recipe by replacing the traditional verjus, an extremely acidic 
wine made from unripe grapes, with comparatively much tamer vinegar. The result was a strikingly smoother 
- yet still tantalizingly tart  - sauce that would go on to become a darling of delicatessens and fine dining 
establishments alike. Made for us by a suppler in France, Trader Joe's Whole Grain Dijon Mustard builds on 
this classic profile by going all in on whole mustard seeds, giving every bite a nice, textural pop to go along with 
its charming, rustic tanginess.

Lightly spicy and superbly spreadable, our Whole Grain Dijon Mustard can be used in pretty much any 
sandwich situation you can think of: it's a hit with hamburgers, a coup with cold cuts, and even goes great with 
grilled cheese. You can also use it as a dip for soft pretzels, cocktail wieners, or chicken tenders. But that's just 
the start: it can be mixed into salad dressings, casseroles, roasted vegetables, and all other sorts of savory fare. 
Put a spoonful into your next dish of baked macaroni and cheese -you might be surprised how many levels 
this Dijon works on.

"021888","Dijon Mustard","Dijon mustard is a ubiquitous condiment, yet none of the options we've seen in other stores even comes 
close to matching the value presented by Trader Joe's Dijon Mustard with White Wine. Ours is a real Dijon 
mustard, crafted by a moutardier in the French countryside just outside of the city of Dijon. Ingredients in 
true Dijon Mustard are subject to strict regulation - ours passes muster(d) in every way. It's a richly-flavored, 
pungent Mustard made with brown mustard seeds, vinegar, white wine, water, and citric acid for freshness. If 
you're a fan of this type of sharp Mustard, you owe it to yourself to try Trader Joe's Dijon Mustard - on hot 
dogs and sausages, burgers and cold sandwiches, in salad dressings and marinades. 

And if you're a fan of great prices, you owe it to your wallet to pick up a jar. We're selling each 13-ounce jar of 
Trader Joe's Dijon Mustard with White Wine for $1.69, the same price it's been since 2010. You'll find it in

"071649","Indian Style Garlic Achaar sauce","Sometimes, you want a sauce to lightly accentuate whatever you're adding it to, to provide a delicate 
counterbalance for your palate. Other times, you just want a sauce that brings a lot of spice, a lot of garlic, and 
a whole lot of flavor. Trader Joe's Indian Style Garlic Achaar Sauce definitely fits in the latter category. It's 
inspired by achaar (""pickle"", in Hindi), a tradition of Indian cuisine that some estimate originated 4,000 years 
ago. Our version swaps out the whole cloves of a typical lahsun ka achaar dish with puréed roasted and fresh 
garlic, which combines with puréed red Anaheim and jalapeño peppers to create one super savory, satisfyingly 
spicy Sauce.

A true catch-all condiment for lovers of garlic and spice, our Garlic Achaar Sauce can be enjoyed with 
everything from rice to roast chicken, sauces to soups, hummus to hamburgers, and beyond. It adds an exciting 
depth of flavor when mixed into stir fries and marinades, a nice bit of complexity to noodle dishes or breakfast 
scrambles, and a thrilling kick of spice when used as a spread on a sandwich. And if you're really looking for 
a jolt of savory sensations, try it as a dipping sauce for french fries, mozzarella sticks, or a plate of Trader Joe's 
Vegetable Samosas [sku 61534].

"071861","Pumpkin Alfredo Sauce","For us, pumpkin is more than just a festive flavoring, it's a cozy, comforting reminder of the changing of the 
seasons, a scrumptious signpost to mark the beginning of the end of the year. It's only natural, then, that we 
would combine the homey sensations of pumpkin with another comfort food classic: rich, creamy Alfredo 
Sauce. Made exclusively for us by an expert Italian supplier, Trader Joe's Pumpkin Alfredo Sauce starts with 
a base of sweet, earthy pumpkin (it's the first-listed ingredient, in fact) to which they add heavy cream, Grana 
Padano & Pecorino Romano cheeses, and a mix of savory spices including garlic, onion, sage, and black pepper. 

The result is a deliciously hearty, harvesttime Pumpkin Alfredo, perfect for warming you up as the weather 
gets crisp and the leaves fall. We especially like it served over its most obvious pasta-partner, fettuccine, or 
Honey Roasted Pumpkin Ravioli {sku 50199], but for more adventurous autumnal eating, try it drizzled over 
roasted veggies, atop a lightly breaded chicken cutlet, or even inside a seasonal squash-based lasagna.

This Pumpkin Spice Hummus fits right in the sweet-hummus category-and it fits right in the season! 

Our hummus supplier-who takes pride in using only the finest, freshest ingredients-starts with vine-dried 
garbanzo beans. Once dried, they're soaked in pure water, then steamed, and mashed. In this case, the usual 
sesame flavor of tahini is swapped out for the rich flavor of pumpkin purée, with cane sugar, pumpkin spices, 
plus notes of vanilla and maple. The smooth texture makes Pumpkin Spice Hummus great for spreading on 
Graham Cracker Squares [sku 71089]. It also works well as a dip for your favorite apple slices or Pretzel Slims 
[sku 87777].

"055269","Autumnal Harvest Creamy Pasta Sauce","If only it were possible to capture the flavors of fall, bottle them up in a jar, and take them home with you. If only 
you could pour them over a bowl of pasta, or bake them into a veggie lasagna, or use them to dip everything 
from Zucchini Fries [sku 52006] to Whole Wheat Butternut Squash Gyoza [sku 55385]. If only reality were as 
satisfying as fantasy. ""If only"" no more, because Trader Joe's Autumnal Harvest Pasta Sauce has arrived, and 
it satisfies on all of these levels.

Autumnal Harvest Pasta Sauce is a tomato-based sauce that's richer, creamer, sweeter, and savorier than its 
typical tomato brethren. Its secret weapon? All those flavors of fall, incorporated here to delicious effect. Pump-
kin, butternut squash, and carrots add sweetness and thicken the sauce; a touch of cream makes it creamier; and 
herbs and spices like rosemary and sage lend a savory finish. We recommend Autumnal Harvest as a suitable 
substitute for any other tomato-based sauce for pasta dishes, a variation on chicken parmesan, or for dipping. 
What pasta is best? Of course, that's a very personal question, but if pressed, we'd recommend our Italian-made 
Trader Joe's Penne [sku 09299]. 

Autumnal Harvest Pasta Sauce is only on our shelves during Pumpkin Season, so this is one of those rare oc-
casions where hasty action is encouraged. In other words, don't be left with ""if only"" when Pumpkin Season is 
over. We're selling each 25-ounce jar for $3.49. You'll find it in our grocery aisle.

"070650","Cacio E Pepe Pasta Sauce","It's the simplest recipes that often have the greatest staying power. Take cacio e pepe, for instance - translated 
literally as ""cheese and pepper"", this creamy, flavorful, two-ingredient-centered sauce is thought to have been 
invented by shepherds in ancient Rome, but still proudly populates restaurant menus to this day. We wanted 
to pay proper tribute to this sublimely simple, time-tested dish, so we went back to its ancestral roots to work 
with an Italian supplier who specializes in traditional recipes. Doing just as the Romans did, Trader Joe's Cacio 
E Pepe Pasta Sauce combines Pecorino Romano cheese, made from sheep's milk, with bold, black pepper to 
create a cheesy, savory sauce that's deceptively simple, and simply delicious.

Now, a classic cacio e pepe dish that you'd find at a restaurant would usually be served over long, twirlable 
noodles like spaghetti or linguine. That's an excellent option for our Cacio E Pepe too, but by all means, don't 
feel boxed in: we find that this Cacio E Pepe serves excellently with all kinds of ravioli, or gnocchi, or in white 
lasagnas. Feel free, even, to serve it over steamed broccoli, a baked potato, or with grilled chicken breast.

Trader Joe's Cold Brew Coffee BBQ Sauce. 

The base is what you might expect from any classic BBQ sauce, incorporating dark brown sugar, tomato

seasonings to amp up the savory and even add a hint of heat-onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, smoked paprika,

of pickled fish and seasonings - a far cry from the tomato ketchup we enjoy today on our burgers, which first 
appeared sometime in the early 19th century. 

Trader Joe's Organic Ketchup contains no pickled fish. It is produced for us in small batches, and does include 
tomatoes. It begins with the purée of vine-ripened, organic California tomatoes, organic cane sugar and a 
concoction of organic spices. So gather up some people, lay out a spread of all the different burgers you can 
get at Trader Joe's (loads of choices here), and top them all with our Organic Ketchup - we can think of far

Introducing our new and improved Trader Joe's Organic Yellow Mustard. 
When recently tasting our Organic Yellow Mustard we had a thought - this

So we started meeting with mustard-makers and tasting lots of organic mustard. 
And we did it! Trader Joe's Organic Yellow Mustard is a great tasting yellow 
mustard! 
And not only did we improve the taste, but we also improved the ingredients (the 
first ingredient is no longer water, and the xanthan gum is gone).  
And that's not all. Not only does it taste better and have better ingredients, but 
we also managed to lower the price!  Now just $1.69 for a 9 ounce bottle!

"071595","Pimento Cheese Dip","Pimento cheese is more than an appetizer or snack - it's an institution. Known by many as ""the caviar of the 
South,"" this highly craveable concoction of shredded Cheddar, zesty, diced pimento, and a binding agent (in 
most cases, mayonnaise) tops everything from crackers to sandwiches to endive leaves across the southern 
United States - and its national popularity has only grown in recent years. In order to keep up with the spreading 
excitement for this exciting spread, we've intoduced Trader Joe's Pimento Cheese Dip, our own take on this 
Southern classic, that ups the creaminess factor via the introduction of a lush, luxurious, Neufchâtel-like cream 
cheese to the mix.

Savory, cheesy, and delightfully full-flavored, Trader Joe's Pimento Cheese Dip can be enjoyed as an indulgent 
hors d'oeuvre before a dinner party, a topping for a burger or hot dog at a barbecue, or just an anytime snack 
with a cracker, tortilla chip, or baby carrot. Our supplier has truly gone the extra mile by using tangy, pickled 
pimentos, adding just the faintest touch of vinegar to every bite. Here's an extra special tip: add a light layer to 
a grilled cheese prior to frying for an utterly out-of-this-world sandwich experience.

"070506","Everything And the Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip","Just as it says on the jar, our certified spice sensation Everything But The Elote Seasoning Blend [sku 66804] 
offers all the flavors of a classic, freshly grilled elote, just without the corn that normally carries them. So when 
the time came to infuse those flavors into a tangy yogurt dip, we got to thinking: why not have our corn and 
season it, too? Boldly flavored with garlic, Parmesan, and chipotle pepper powder, and featuring toothsome 
kernels of sweet yellow corn, Trader Joe's Everything And The Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip truly lets you 
have it all.

As it turns out, creamy, lightly tart yogurt and zesty, lightly smoky elote make for a pretty perfect flavor and 
texture combination - and one that serves equally well with pretty much any kind of scooping vehicle, be it 
a tortilla chip, cracker, or baby carrot. We also feel obligated to mention how well Everything And The Elote 
Dip works as a spread, especially on sandwiches and wraps that already have a spicy element. And if you really 
want to take things to an elote extreme, you can always attempt a grilled cheese spread with a layer this Dip,

"068423","Spicy Cashew Butter Dressing","It's not every day that you encounter a salad dressing that's simulataneously sweet, spicy, creamy, and vegan - 
unless you happen to visit your neighborhood Trader Joe's every day, that is. Because that's precisely what you'll 
encounter in Trader Joe's Spicy Cashew Butter Dressing, a salad dressing that combines smooth, creamy 
cashew butter with lime juice, ginger, cilantro, and hot chili peppers into one remarkably versatile condiment. 
And have we mentioned that it's totally vegan?

With its almost luxuriously creamy texture and zesty, herby, charmingly aromatic notes, Trader Joe's Spicy 
Cashew Butter Dressing adds flavorful flair to any leafy green salad, but that's hardly where we'd stop. Cold 
noodles, grilled fish, pan-fried poultry, savory dishes of all kinds can be improved with a drizzling of this 
Dressing. We find its snappy, savory profile makes it especially suited for topping plant-based burgers or vegan 
jackfruit tacos. You'll find its retail makes it an especially great value: we're selling 11-fl. oz. bottles of Trader 
Joe's Spicy Cashew Butter Dressing for $3.99*, every day. Look for them in our refrigerated section, next to

"001535","Salsa Autentica","When it comes to something as simply delicious and purely flavorful as salsa, there's no need to overcomplicate 
things. That's why, with Trader Joe's Salsa Autentica, we opted for a simple recipe using just six ingredients: 
tomato puree, yellow chili peppers, salt, vinegar, dried onion, and garlic powder. Combined, these ingredients 
create an impeccably textured Salsa with plenty of savory spices and tempered heat - a Salsa that pays homage 
to its culinary tradition and goes well on just about anything - a Salsa that's, simply put, simply Autentica. 

Our Salsa Autentica's zesty flavor profile not only makes it a natural companion for dipping with your favorite 
tortilla chip, but it also makes a great condiment to pour over nachos, to spoon into burritos, or to apply 
generously on savory breakfast items.  Don't just take our word for it, its simple, universal appeal has clearly 
stood the test of time: for close to three decades, and it's set the standard for other salsas on our shelves.

"053799","Organic Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce","One of our most successful approaches to developing new products is to simply combine two distinct items 
that are already well loved. Think Cocoa Almond Spread (chocolate + almonds), or Reduced Guilt Chunky 
Guacamole (Greek yogurt + guacamole), or Thai Chili Lime Cashews (Thai lime & chili seasoning + cashews). 
Don't forget one of our all-time favorites: Pumpkin ""fill-in-the-blank"" (Pumpkin + anything). 

Organic Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce is our latest foray into the art of food fusion. As far as we 
can tell, it appears destined for condiment greatness. The formula is simple: Sriracha + BBQ Sauce¿ but, the 
genius is in the details. We start with Sriracha (not the famous ""Rooster"" version, but our very own recipe). 
This spicy mixture of chili peppers, garlic, sugar, and vinegar is deftly combined with what some might label as 
""Memphis-style"" BBQ Sauce-referring to its tomato-base, thick texture, reddish-brown color, and the taste of 
sweet molasses. As if this duo were not already dynamic enough, we decided to go all out Organic. Each and 
every ingredient in our Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce was produced using methods that preserve the 
environment and avoid synthetic materials, such as pesticides and antibiotics.

This marvelous marriage tastes of Sriracha and... BBQ Sauce. It is garlicky, sweet, and spicy-all at once. The 
flavors here enhance burgers, meat kabobs, beef or pork ribs, even grilled seafood. These might seem like rather 
expected applications for a sauce such as this, but the innovation doesn't need to stop with Trader Joe's. First, 
procure your own 19.5-ounce, screw-cap bottle for $2.99. Open it up. Love it. Then, proceed to combine with 
whatever foods your heart might fancy. If you hit on something big, let us know!

"069553","Organic Sweet & Spicy Pineapple  BBQ Sauce","Some BBQ sauces are sweet. Some BBQ sauces are spicy. Some are a little bit of both. Trader Joe's Organic 
Sweet & Spicy Pineapple BBQ Sauce is a lot of both. It's made with real crushed pineapple, pineapple juice 
concentrate, and a blend of savory spices including habanero pepper powder - all of which are organic, by the 
way. This saucy synthesis of sweet tropical heat makes for an amazing glaze for ribs or chicken (try it on a batch 
of Organic Chicken Drumsticks [SKU 99264], for starters), a tip-top topping for burgers (especially with an 
added slice of grilled pineapple), and a sublime substitute for tomato sauce when making spicy BBQ pizza. In 
short, it's everything we like about grilling, sweetness, spice, and summer, poured into one bottle.

That said, this summer-y treat won't be around forever. We're bringing in a limited number of cases of this 
Sauce; just enough to last us through the rest of the season. So, while supplies last, make sure to grab a 19.5

tomatoes, buoyed by a nose-tingling horseradish. Jalapeños and green chili peppers add heat; Worcestershire 
sauce, capers, and onions add some savory balance; and lemon juice and vinegar kick up the acid ante. It's got 
that authentic, tangy & tongue-tingling Bloody Mary taste (sans vodka), with just enough heat to keep you 
sipping - or in this case, dipping - for more.

While Bloody Mary Salsa makes a bang-up dip for nearly all things crunchy (we love it with our Salted Tortilla

you need a bracing hit of flavor, no matter the meal. Try rolling some up in a bean & cheese burrito, spooning

what really distinguishes a good pickle. You get the flavors of tangy vinegar, sea salt, and savory spices. With 
Trader Joe's Dill Pickle Hummus, we've taken that pickle flavor and literally put it into creamy, dip-able, 
spreadable hummus!

Our supplier starts with chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) and cooks them down right along with whole dill 
pickles. The pickle-y chickpeas are then combined with tahini (ground sesame seeds), extra virgin olive oil, 
sea salt, and seasonings-which include dried onion & garlic, black pepper, and dill weed. The finished Dill 
Pickle Hummus may look like typical hummus on the outside, but every scoop delivers the terrific taste of

"070634","Vegan Tzatziki Dip","At Trader Joe's, we endeavor to provide as many plant-based options for our customers as possible, even when 
the challenge is considerable. Take tzatziki, for example: the decidedly dairy-based creaminess of this classic 
Mediterranean condiment is more or less its defining feature, and one that's hard to replicate without milk. 
After trying a few variations, we found that a plant-based, dairy-free cream cheese provided the best base, and 
after mixing in just the right amount of lemon juice and chopped up cucumber, fresh dill, and garlic, we knew 
we had it: Trader Joe's Vegan Tzatziki Dip was born.

Creamy, herby, and refreshingly tangy, this Vegan Tzatziki is a rich and flavorful condiment that can be 
enjoyed as both a dip and a sauce. Perfect when paired up with other Mediterranean fare, its cool bits of 
cucumber and  dill provide a complementary counterbalance to the aromatics of coriander and cumin, making 
it a great condiment for falafel wraps and bowls, in particular. A treat for vegans and carnivores alike, it's also 
great in a pita piled high with Gyro Slices [sku 55277] and greens. And on top of everything else, it's also a real 
value: each eight-ounce tub of Trader Joe's Vegan Tzatziki Dip sells for $3.99*, every day. Look for them in

"070652","Cajun Alfredo Pasta Sauce","One of our most treasured aspects of Alfredo sauce (and believe us, we have a long list of treasured Alfredo 
aspects) is how well its round, rich, elegantly cheesy profile plays off of other, sharper flavors. As evidenced by 
our previous suite of seasonal sauces, including Limone Alfredo Sauce [sku 66016] and Black Truffle Alfredo 
Pasta Sauce [sku 63682], combining Alfredo with tastes that cut through its luxurious creaminess yields some 
seriously satisfying results. In the case of Trader Joe's Cajun Style Alfredo Sauce, we've taken inspiration 
from the fiery flavors of Cajun cuisine to create a savory, peppery pasta sauce that pairs exceptionally well with 
proteins of all kinds.

Starting with a base of heavy cream, butter, and a mix of Grana Padano and Pecorino Romano cheeses, our 
supplier in Italy adds a blend of Louisiana cooking-inspired spices including garlic, oregano, paprika, and 
fennel to make each jar of this Cajun Alfredo. The resulting Sauce is full-flavored and peppery, with a pleasant 
level of heat that makes it a great companion to grilled shrimp, roasted broccoli, cheesy tortellini, or even as an 
alternative pizza sauce, if you're truly adventurous. Now through the end of the summer, you can find 14.5-oz.

"069566","Bolognese Style Tomato & Beef Pasta Sauce","Kaizen is one of our core values at Trader Joe's. Based on a Japanese business concept, kaizen boils down to a 
commitment to make marginal improvements all the time, every day. Or course, this approach applies to our 
product development, and you can witness the results in our new Bolognese Style Tomato & Beef Pasta Sauce. 

For many years, we sold Bolognese Style Tomato Meat Pasta Sauce [sku 80852]. It was good, but we thought it 
could possibly be more meaty and more flavorful. To accomplish this, we reached out to one of our suppliers 
who makes sauce for a famous NYC Italian restaurant. They knew just how to proceed, beginning with 100% 
imported Italian tomatoes that have a sweeter profile, ensuring a less acidic, better tasting sauce. To make it 
meatier, they brilliantly¿ added more beef! In fact, this new sauce contains 9% beef, compared to the 6% in 
our previous Bolognese (6% is the industry standard). It may not seem like a lot more, but once you taste it, 
you'll definitely see the difference!

"070839","Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce","Though we might think of it as a rather timeless classic, bolognese pasta sauce is a relatively recent invention. 
First described in print in the late 1800s, ragù alla bolognese started as a descendent of French ragoût, a hearty, 
meat-based stew. Since then, there's never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce - many 
iterations don't even include tomatoes - other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center 
of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe's Vegan Bolognese 
Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender 
crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.

Made with tomatoes imported from Italy, our Vegan Bolognese is rich and satisfying to vegans and non-
vegans alike, with lightly herbaceous and peppery notes. Like our other jarred pasta sauces, preparation is as 
simple as warming on the stovetop until heated through, then mixing with freshly cooked and drained pasta. 
While spaghetti is a popular pairing choice outside of Italy, within Bologna itself, it's more often made with 
flatter, broader noodles like pappardelle, or tube shapes like macaroni or rigatoni, both of which complement 
its thicker, meatier texture. Of course, the ultimate complement to a quick, delicious, easy-to-prepare pasta 
dish is great value, which is why we're selling 18-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce 
for $3.99*. You can find them in our grocery aisle.

"070199","Thai Style Green Chili Sauce","In our search for new and exciting products, our buyers draw inspiration from flavors and foodways all over 
the globe, and one culinary tradition that never fails to inspire is Thai cuisine. In the case of Trader Joe's Thai 
Style Green Chili Sauce, we were inspired by one northern Thai dish in particular: nam prik noom. This relish-
like sauce is typically made from a mix of ingredients including fresh chilis, garlic, shallots, and lime juice, all 
pounded together in a mortar. Our version adds some additional aromatic elements in the form of lemon grass 
and Thai lime leaves to create a delightfully complex condiment which doubles as a zesty, delicious dip.

At a Thai restaurant, nam prik noom would traditionally be served alongside the main course, to be enjoyed 
atop fresh veggies, or as a spicy dip with pork cracklings. Both excellent applications, but we'd add that our 
Green Chili Sauce also tastes wonderful over a warm bowl of rice, mixed in with noodles, spooned over 
dumplings, or just casually dipped with chips. It's just spicy enough to provide a joyful, but not overpowering, 
kick of heat, while its savory and tart elements make it a great sauce (or even a marinade) for milder proteins 
like chicken and fish. Since our buyers are also inspired by great price points, each 7.3 oz. jar of Trader Joe's 
Thai Style Green Chili Sauce sells for $2.99*, every day. Look for it in our grocery aisle.

"062048","Pepita Salsa","We're famously infatuated with pumpkin. You could call it our bread and butter. Honestly, you could go even 
farther and call it our Pumpkin Bread [sku 52484] and Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372]. But we hope that in all the 
pumpkin craze, we don't overshadow one of the best parts of the pumpkin, the seed. Pumpkin seeds, also known 
as pepitas, are an exceptionally crunchy, slightly nutty, deliciously flavorful treat that can bring a serious savory 
factor to pretty much anything they're added to, be it a pesto sauce, trail mix, or Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa.

By combining the bright, zesty tomato and pepper flavors of a traditional chunky salsa with the texture and 
nuttiness of finely chopped pepitas, our Pepita Salsa has created a savory synthesis of seed and spice. Not only 
do the pepitas add a nice thickness to the Salsa's body, making it even easier to scoop up with a tortilla or corn 
chip, but their hearty, earthy flavor balances the acidity of the tomatoes and vinegar expertly. On top of that, 
each bite of Pepita Salsa also carries the delicate sweet heat of puréed bell pepper and chipotle spices, making 
this one seriously satisfying salsa.

Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Pepita salsa to our legendary family of pumpkin products. To cel-
ebrate, we recommend using it in any situation that calls for salsa, from a classic chips and salsa appetizer 
(especially our Quinoa and Black Bean Infused Tortilla Chips [sku 97226]), to a topping for tacos (especially with 
vegetarian Jackfruit [sku 58772] tacos), or as the sauce for homemade chilaquiles. We're selling 12-ounce jars of 
Trader Joe's Pepita Salsa for $2.99, a remarkable value for such a unique (and uniquely delicious) salsa.

"069916","Magnifisauce!","When it came time to name this new sauce/condiment/gift from the gods, there were many contenders. In the 
end, though, its utter magnificence dictated that only > Magnifisauce would do.

What's so magnificent about Trader Joe's Magnifisauce? Only... everything. We were inspired by some famous 
condiments that are not widely available and that do, in other places, require the purchase of other comestibles. 
Unlike our primary source of inspiration, our version of this special spread is available across the country, and we 
do not require additional purchases. (Though you are, as always, welcome to shop for what suits your mood in 
the moment.) Magnifisauce is a truly special sauce whose flavors harken to an array of classic condiments; it's a 
mustard-mayo-ketchup-relish kind of blend, with the subtle tang of vinegar and a spread of spices. In other words, 
it's made with ""slow-food"" ingredients, but a squeeze of the bottle gets you the best of the fast-food experience. 
Magnificent... Magnifisauce.

We're selling each 9.5 ounce squeeze bottle for $2.99.* You'll find it in the condiment section of our grocery aisle.

"065510","Spicy Chunky Tomato & Pepper Pasta Sauce","We sell quite a number of tomato-based sauces for pasta. Still, we've been missing one that has a chunky profile. 
We also haven't had one on our shelves with any significant heat. Trader Joe's Spicy Chunky Tomato & Pepper 
Pasta Sauce has arrived to fill that need!

It's fair to say that what this product-name lacks in creativity, it makes up for in specificity. The sauce is certainly 
Chunky, including whole, peeled, San Marzano tomatoes, with additional diced tomatoes. There are also red 
bell peppers in the mix. And it's Spicy, with heat that comes from harissa, including spices such as paprika, 
cumin, garlic, cayenne, black pepper, and coriander.

Although we call it a Pasta Sauce, there is so much more you can do with the contents of this jar. It's perfect as 
a ready-made base for Shakshuka (recipe on label). Or, you can use it for a pizza sauce with extra pizazz. Make 
it your base for soups or stews, such as Chicken Cacciatore. However you use it, you'll find our Spicy Chunky

just about everyone's taste, but until recently we didn't have a fresh, organic offering. We created Trader Joe's 
Organic Medium Salsa to meet that need.

This is a vegan, restaurant-style salsa made entirely from organic ingredients, including diced Roma tomatoes, 
onions, cilantro, and lime juice. Fresh, organic Anaheim chili peppers and organic jalapeño peppers create a 
medium heat level, which is ideal for chip dipping before your tacos, and just a great for spooning on top of 
your tacos. Heck, it's so tasty, you might just be spooning it right into your mouth!

"067700","Creamy Cauliflower Jalapeño Dip","When we sampled a creamy cauliflower-based dip on a visit to one of our suppliers, we knew it had serious 
potential. Just the fact that it had cauliflower was already a win! However, we felt that overall the dip wasn't 
very¿ shall we say, virtuous? 

We got to work with the dip maker and we were not only able to move cauliflower to the top of the ingredient 
deck, we were also able to tweak the other ingredients to make what was to become our version, Trader Joe's 
Creamy Cauliflower & Jalapeño Dip, just a little more nutritionally wholesome.

With cauliflower as the base, this dip also includes cream cheese, light cream, ricotta, and Parmesan for a truly 
Creamy feel. We also added a wee touch of Jalapeño peppers for some extra, contrasting flavor. Bottom line? 
This Dip eats more indulgent than it actually is, with just 40 calories per serving (2 Tbsp.). We're selling each 
ten-ounce tub of Creamy Cauliflower & Jalapeño Dip every day for $3.49. Find it in our deli refrigerators.

"065624","Buffalo Chicken Dip","A now-classic recipe that reaches peak search-engine status during football season, Buffalo Chicken Dip 
combines the lip-smacking tang of chicken wings with oozing, melty cheese in an easy-to-scoop dip. Our 
version includes bite-sized pieces of white meat chicken breast anchored with a cayenne pepper sauce, with 
notes of vinegar and savory garlic flavor. Cream cheese, sour cream, and Monterey Jack meld the savory

"062789","Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa","The name of Trader Joe's Organic Thick & Chunky Salsa does aptly communicate its texture, but what it 
doesn't convey is the devoted following it's already garnered amongst our tasting panel. One reason for this 
devotion is its USDA-certified organic status; up until now, TJ's Organic Tomatillo & Roasted Yellow Chili 
Salsa [sku 98838] has been our lone shelf-stable organic salsa offering. Another reason-the most important 
reason-is its sheer deliciousness. 

Made with big chunks of organic diced tomatoes, organic tomato paste, organic onions, and organic jalapeños, 
then spiced with organic cayenne pepper and organic dehydrated garlic, Trader Joe's Organic Thick & Chunky 
Salsa is fresh and flavorful, packing just the right amount of medium-level heat. And, boy, is this Salsa versatile. 
Sure, you can use it as you would any other-in burritos, tacos, and quesadillas, with tortilla chips, etc. But you 
can also use it in less expected ways. Spoon it atop baked chicken or fish. Pour a few jars into a slow cooker with 
TJ's Bone-In Skin-On Chicken Thighs [sku 61046] and vegetables. Use it as the sauce on a tasty Mexican-inspired 
pizza. Or, just scoop it up with TJ's Organic Taza Blues [sku 63102].

"062525","Avocado Tzatziki Dip","We often say that all of our products have a story to tell. This is the story of Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki 
Dip (that's zaht-ZEE-kee), by way of a classic: our original TJ's Tzatziki Dip [sku 71714]. Once upon a time, 
one of our favorite domestic fresh foods suppliers traveled to Greece in search of unique foods that weren't 
readily available in the U.S. What they found was Tzatziki, a creamy garlic-cucumber-mint dip that's part of the 
fabric of Greek cuisine, and they worked closely with our Buyers to recreate a version made with Greek yogurt 
exclusively for Trader Joe's, which we've been selling ever since.

Fast-forward some twenty-plus years to the present. Many things have changed, but not our Customers' love 
of Tzatziki. So our Buyer had a thought: why not combine this TJ's classic with something new? Perhaps, 
she thought, with a food that's rich and creamy, filled with healthy fats, and seemingly hipper than ever: the 
avocado. She tinkered with the recipe for months-settling on a 30% freshly diced avocado base and ultimately 
adding some diced jalapeños to the list of inclusions-and new Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki Dip is the 
[tangy, creamy, and totally addictive] fruit of her labor. 

Trader Joe's Avocado Tzatziki is a super dip for veggies, chips, or Spud Crunchies [sku 59203]. It's perfect for 
pita. And it's surprisingly scrumptious on salads and in sandwiches. Use it just as you would ""regular"" Tzatziki 
or ""regular"" guacamole. Pick up a 12-ounce tub of this cool, green wonder today, available in our refrigerated

"059192","Zhoug Sauce","Zhoug (pronounced ZOOg) likely originated in Yemen, and is now popular throughout the Middle East. It's 
a cilantro-based sauce/condiment that's been likened to ""Middle Eastern pesto,"" but we think that description 
shortchanges the originality of this spicy, fragrant, fabulously flavorful culinary creation. It's a sauce that's taking 
the internet by storm - from food blogs to social media feeds, Zhoug is having its moment in the digital sun. 
This really is the ideal time to introduce Zhoug to our stores.

Trader Joe's Zhoug Sauce comes to us from a California vendor well-versed in the art and science of Middle 
Eastern foods. Here, they've put together a very straightforward collection of ingredients - cilantro, canola 
oil, jalapeño peppers, chile flakes, garlic, cardamom, sea salt, and cumin seeds  - to create a sauce/dip/spread/
condiment that bursts with vibrant flavor and color. We call it ""very spicy"" on our label, and some will find 
it ""very spicy."" Those more into spicy foods may find it only moderately spicy. Everyone who tries it will be 
impressed by how the flavor of every ingredient comes through, even as the flavors blend beautifully into the 
finished product. 

Try Zhoug as a dip for vegetable crudités or pita (bread or chips). It makes a delicious sandwich spread, a super 
sauce for pasta (here's where it's like pesto), and a vibrant addition to a plate of meat or fish. It's traditionally 
served alongside hummus and falafel, and we're all for sticking to this tradition. Keeping to our tradition of 
value, we're selling each eight ounce tub for $2.99, every day. You'll find it in our refrigerated case.

"059417","Extra Hot Habanero Ghost Pepper Salsa","A hyperbole is a figure of speech where exaggeration is used for dramatic effect, like ""I ate a million chips today"" 
or ""this work day will never end."" When we call our new Extra Hot Habanero Ghost Pepper Salsa extra hot, 
though, we mean it. In this case, there is no hyperbole or exaggeration. It is hot-and also delicious.

Ghost chili peppers are some of the spiciest chilies around. Naturally, we turned to these to heat up our spiciest 
salsa to date-but a little bit goes a long way. The small-but-mighty amount of smoked ghost pepper powder 
we use is combined with vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh onion, cilantro, habanero peppers, and roasted red bell 
and poblano peppers. The result? A spicy Salsa that's full of flavor and has that perfect Mexican restaurant-style 
consistency: not too chunky, and perfectly scoopable. 

Enjoying the spiciness of this Salsa is as easy as scooping it up with some Tortilla Chips [sku 00553]. Of course, 
there are about a million other uses (now that's hyperbole). Serve it with Queso Dip [sku 99262] if you want to 
mellow out that heat a little bit. Or, spoon some on your morning eggs, on quesadillas, on tacos, on Black Bean 
& Cheese Taquitos [sku 00553]¿

If heat's your thing, pick up a 12-ounce tub of Trader Joe's Extra Hot Habanero Ghost Pepper Salsa for $3.29. 
You'll find it with our other (less intimidatingly spicy) fresh salsas.

"058114","Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce","The versatility of the Cocos nucifera (the coconut tree) cannot be overstated. It produces an impressive number 
of coconut-based products with varied, but important, uses: coconut meat and coconut milk for cooking, 
coconut water for hydration, coconut sugar for baking, ¿ Another lesser known (but not for long) member of 
the coconut clan is the sap of the coconut blossom. When fermented, this sap forms a savory, amino-rich sauce 
with a whole host of uses. With the coconut craze still going strong, we felt it was the right time to introduce 
Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce to our clan of coconut products. 

Made in Sri Lanka, organic coconut sap is hand-harvested and fermented, then boiled to create an amino-rich 
sauce-13 amino acids, to be exact. A touch of sea salt provides a balanced mineral quality. Flavor-wise, coconut 
does not come to mind: Organic Coconut Aminos can be likened to soy sauce, though not quite as salty, and 
with a touch of sweetness. There are no soy ingredients in this product, which makes it an often-called-for 
flavoring in paleo recipes. And at 300mg of sodium per tablespoon (vs. 920mg in the leading soy sauce brand), 
this gluten-free, kosher (pareve) Sauce is a great option for those looking to reduce their sodium intake. 

Use this Seasoning Sauce as a less-salty stand-in for tamari or soy sauce. Deepen the flavor of sautéed veggies 
or fried rice. Blend it with garlic, lemon juice and honey for a simple salmon marinade. Add it to salad dressing 
or serve with sushi. You can even add a few dashes to a spicy Bloody Mary for extra umami.

We're selling 8.5 fluid ounce bottles of Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Aminos Seasoning Sauce for $2.99-a 
fraction of the price we've seen elsewhere. You can find them with our other condiments.

we're not just listing delicious Mexican foods for fun. We've compiled this list to give you an idea of the many 
dishes you'll soon be able to make even better. Yes, better. And spicier. This is where Trader Joe's Organic Spicy 
Taco Sauce comes in.

Making a taco better than its already-delicious self sounds like a tall task, but then you probably haven't tried 
a taco that's been doused in TJ's Taco Sauce, which is not just Spicy but also Organic. We start with a base of 
distilled vinegar and tomato paste; add some heat thanks to chili pepper powder, red jalapeño pepper purée, 
and cayenne peppers; and round out the flavor with spices like garlic powder, pepper, and oregano. It's savory, 
tangy, and spicy-but not so spicy that you'd have any qualms about dousing your food in it.

We tried to hint at this in the beginning, but just because it's called Taco Sauce doesn't mean you have to use 
this stuff exclusively on tacos. In reality, you might want to use it on everything. Okay, probably not on your 
morning bowl of cereal, but you get the idea-Mexican dishes, scrambled eggs, burgers, TJ's Breaded Chicken

"063486","Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce","BBQ sauce is a grill's best friend. Its tangy, sweet-smokiness instantly ups the ante on grilled meat, ribs, and 
chicken, commanding center of the plate attention with the flick of a basting brush. Our Kansas City Style 
BBQ Sauce [sku 31314] was a longtime resident on our shelves that upheld this meaty tradition with aplomb, 
but over the years, its ingredient deck started to fall out of line with current trends. Retiring this old standby 
allowed us to make room for a new sauce that we think will be an instant classic: Trader Joe's Organic Kansas 
City Style BBQ Sauce.

Our Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce went through extensive tasting panel review prior to its approval-
after all, the old sauce was a customer favorite for a reason! (and eating BBQ week after week wasn't bad, 
either). Our goal was to emulate the irresistible tanginess of the previous sauce, while at the same time reducing 
the sugar and balancing the smoke. We think we accomplished it, with a base of tomato puree, brown sugar 
and molasses for tang and sweetness, amped up with natural hickory smoke flavor. Onion powder and garlic 
powder add savory notes, rounded out by paprika and chipotle powder for a smoky finish. 

This certified Organic BBQ Sauce is a nod to our tradition of striving to be better at what we do, everyday, and 
of introducing products that present an incredible value to our customers-which is exactly why we're selling 
18-ounce bottles of this new & improved, Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce for $2.69. That's the very 
same price as its non-organic predecessor. In other words, Kansas City, meet Value City!

"063281","Organic Balsamic & Fig Dressing","After a recent review of our shelf-stable dressing offerings, we concluded that it was time for a Trader Joe's 
dressing revolution of sorts. Sure, we have some great options, but we realized that we've had more or less the 
same salad dressings on our shelves for years and years. It was time for some updating. And that's just what 
we've done. 

One of three in a lineup of new dressings is Trader Joe's Organic Balsamic & Fig Dressing. Made with organic 
extra virgin olive oil and authentic organic Italian balsamic vinegar, this dressing is smooth, robust, and tangy, 
just as you'd expect from a balsamic-based dressing. But we've also mixed in real, organic fig paste-made from 
California-grown figs-and organic honey to balance out the dressing's natural acidity. 

Trader Joe's Organic Balsamic & Fig Dressing makes a fantastic marinade for chicken or steak. It's also perfect

"063353","Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing","After a recent review of our shelf-stable dressing offerings, we concluded that it was time for a Trader Joe's 
dressing revolution of sorts. Sure, we have some great options, but we realized that we've had more or less the 
same salad dressings on our shelves for years and years. It was time for some updating. And that's just what 
we've done. 

One of three in a lineup of new dressings is Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing. Inspired by Asia's 
best-selling bottled salad dressing, this dressing is thick, slightly sweet, and packed with plenty of umami-
goodness. It's made with organic sunflower oil, organic soy sauce, organic white vinegar, and, of course, organic 
toasted sesame oil, which has been cold-pressed and cold-filtered to maintain its deep, roasted sesame profile. 
We also add whole black sesame seeds to deepen that sesame flavor, and a pinch of organic brown sugar to 
sweeten the deal.

Trader Joe's Organic Toasted Sesame Dressing is perfect in salads, slaws, sandwiches, and wraps. It pairs well 
with roasted veggies or cold pasta dishes, and it makes a marvelous marinade for meat of all types. Now that's 
versatility.

"066912","Organic Cucumber Kefir Dressing","Some of our newer organic salad dressings, like Organic Toasted Sesame [sku 63353], are becoming Customer 
favorites-so we thought it was time to add another! Introducing Trader Joe's Organic Cucumber Kefir 
Dressing.

The base is organic kefir (that yogurt-like beverage fermented with probiotics and yeast) with organic sunflower 
oil, and organic white & red vinegars. To that smooth, slightly creamy foundation is added organic cucumber 
purée and some other lively seasonings, such as organic lemon juice, organic oregano, and organic dill. The 
resulting flavor profile is light and refreshing-excellent drizzled on your favorite greens with grilled Swordfish 
[sku 01290].

"068174","Vegan Caesar Dressing","Since its populariztion in the mid-20th century, the Caesar salad has remained a restaurant staple, celebrated 
for its remarkably savory, creamy, peppery dressing. For as long, however, those same qualities made it quite 
difficult to replicate faithfully without the use of animal-derived products. Until today, that is! Trader Joe's 
Vegan Caesar Dressing uses an ingenious mix of plant-based ingredients, including tofu, capers, mustard, 
and miso to create a deliciously savory, inticingly peppery, and satisfyingly creamy Caesar Dressing while 
remaining totally vegan.

While Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing obviously makes a great vegan Caesar salad (simply toss with our 
pre-chopped Organic Romaine Salad [sku 32601] and you're ready to go!), that's hardly its only function. We 
find it also works fantastically as a dip, especially when paired with crudités, and even works wonders as a 
creamy, umami-rich sandwich spread. If that weren't enough, it's also a marvelous deal: we're selling 11-fl. oz. 
bottles of Trader Joe's Vegan Caesar Dressing for $3.99*, every day. Look for them in our deli section, with 
our other refrigerated salad dressings.

"066253","Herbed Tahini Sauce","Our refrigerated case is filled with fare to help kick up the flavor in your favorite foods without a ton of effort 
on your part. Dazzling dips and savory sauces abound, each one ready to transform dinnertime with the scoop 
of a spoon. Joining this hallowed hodgepodge of tastiness is none other than Trader Joe's Herbed Tahini 
Sauce. It offers the craveable creaminess and nutty, savory flavor of classic Tahini, paired with a good amount 
of parsley, garlic powder and a hint of chili flakes. 

How do we love thee, Herbed Tahini Sauce? Let us count the ways: as a dip for dolmas and falafel; drizzled on 
grilled drumsticks, carrots, and steamed rice; spread on a Turkeyless Patty [sku 68991] and top with roasted red 
pepper for a twist on the classic burger; mixed with a bit of apple cider vinegar & olive oil for a creamy, tangy 
salad dressing. Why not add Trader Joe's Herbed Tahini Sauce to your shopping list and add your favorite 
serving suggestion to this list? You'll find eight-ounce tubs in our refrigerators for $2.99* each.

"068554","Honey Aleppo Pepper Sauce","The branches of the chili pepper family tree are long and full, populated by a remarkably diverse range of 
cultivars. Some chili peppers, like jalapeños, have a fresh, vegetal flavor to go along with their heat, while others, 
like habaneros, have a sweeter, fruitier profile to match their fire. Aleppo peppers, used primarily in Middle 
Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine, have a uniquely earthy, almost cumin-like flavor and a slow-building, 
satisfying level of spice. In other words, the perfect pepper to pick for our sweet, sticky, superbly tangy sauce 
and marinade, Trader Joe's Honey Aleppo Sauce.

Combining the savory flavor and mild heat of Aleppo peppers with the sweetness of honey, Honey Aleppo  
Sauce is one of those sauces that truly goes with everything. As a dipping sauce, it coats crispy and crunchy 
fare with savory flair. As a salad dressing, it adds a delightfully sweet and spicy edge to leafy greens. And as a 
marinade, it truly excels, providing all manner of proteins with a tangy, spicy glaze that caramelizes wonderfully 
on the grill or in the pan - trust us, you'll absolutely want to give it a try with some of our Argentinian Red 
Shrimp [sku 71696]. Trust us when we say that Trader Joe's Honey Aleppo Sauce is a true value, too: we're 
selling 10-ounce bottles for $3.99*, every day. Look for them in our grocery aisle.

"059261","Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce","For many years, we carried a green curry simmer sauce on our shelves. It was good, as sauces go, but it never 
really set the world on fire. You see, this sauce had a bit of an identity crisis. It contained some nontraditional 
ingredients, along with gums, soy, and wheat. So, we set out to create a sauce that would exceed expectations, 
full of zesty green curry flavor-and in doing so, we were able to provide a better value for our customers. Yay! 
Without further adieu, allow us to reintroduce Trader Joe's Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce.

Our Product Innovator went straight to the source in Thailand to create this Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce. 
It starts with a base of velvety coconut milk, and an incredibly flavorful, spicy green curry paste. Packed into this 
paste are shallots, lemongrass, garlic, galangal, coriander seed, Thai lime peel, ginger, turmeric and cumin-all 
contributing to its savory, aromatic awesomeness. The Sauce is rounded out with rice bran oil, sugar, basil leaf 
and green chili for just the right amount of heat.

To get your fill of Green Curry goodness, sauté a half-pound of your favorite protein or tofu until cooked through. 
Add an equal amount of vegetables to the pan, and then cover everything in this Sauce. Simmer until hot and 
vegetables are tender, and then serve over rice or noodles. Enjoy right away, or portion into containers-that's a 
few days of tasty lunches on your hands, for a fraction of what it would cost for take-away Thai.

We're offering 12-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Thai Green Curry Simmer Sauce for $1.99, everyday-that's 50 
cents lower than the retail of our former green curry simmer sauce. You'll find them on our grocery shelves.
