"079121","Teeny Tiny Pecan Pies","The correct pronunciation of ""pecan"" may be up for debate, but Trader Joe's Teeny Tiny Pecan Pies are an 
undeniably delicious and endearing dessert. Like our Teeny Tiny Apple Pies [sku 77455], this nutty variety is 
made for us in Canada, with each pie measuring about three inches in diameter. A sweet brown sugar & Pecan 
filling is nestled in a flaky, buttery crust, topped with an (ironically named) Junior Mammoth pecan half, 
and baked until golden brown. Delightfully gooey with a soft bite, these petite pastries will satisfy Pecan Pie 
cravings without the commitment to a full-size pie. 

Teeny Tiny Pecan Pies are excellent right out of the box, and are especially delectable when heated in the 
oven, microwave, or air fryer, according to package directions. If you've got a second to spare, top yours with 
a flourish of Light Whipped Cream [sku 22791], or a teeny tiny scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576]. 
With four pies per box, you can always enjoy them with friends and freshly-brewed cups of Joe Medium Roast 
Ground Coffee [sku 56332]. You'll find Teeny Tiny Pecan Pies in the bakery section, only during the holidays-
pick up a box while supplies last!

"079114","Dinner Rolls","Hard, stale bread certainly has a place at the dinner table in the form of salad croutons and poultry stuffing. 
When it comes to rolls, however, it's quite...sacrolligious. And yet, dry Dinner Rolls seem to prevail in grocery 
stores across the land. Not at Trader Joe's, though-we say ""no"" to roll mediocrity with our soft and moist 
Dinner Rolls.

Bite into one of these pull-apart Rolls, and you'll notice that they're incredibly moist compared to other store-
bought options. The secret? Potato flour! This spudsy superstar attracts and holds water better than other 
flours, so we add a bit of it to give Trader Joe's Dinner Rolls their especially soft texture. A touch of sugar lends 
subtle sweetness, making for craveable rolls that'll have you questioning if it's worth saving room for dinner. 

Dinner Rolls are most delicious when warmed in the oven for 3-5 minutes at 400°F. Place them in a basket 
atop holiday dinner tables and serve with Salted Butter Quarters [sku 06252], or tangy Cultured Salted Butter 
[sku 53720], if you're feeling fancy. They also excel as slider buns, and as carb companions to soup and salad 
dinners. You'll find Dinner Rolls in the bakery section through the holiday season, while supplies last.

"079110","Organic Fig & Honey Batard","Nothing says French bread like the iconic baguette seen in many a market tote bag. But what about this svelte 
bread's more rotund presentation: batard? We'd wager this lesser-known shape is equally delicious, especially 
when in the form of Trader Joe's savory-sweet Organic Fig & Honey Batard.

This Batard comes to us from a French bakery that specializes in Organic, artisanal bread. They mix dried 
Figs and Honey into traditional French bread dough for a bit of sweetness and pops of subtle fruit flavor. The 
dough is then shaped into an oblong loaf and baked until light golden brown. Soft and airy on the inside, it's 
best enjoyed after warming and crisping in the oven, according to package directions.

The sweetness of Organic Fig & Honey Batard makes it delightful on its own, and a wonderful match for 
strong and salty flavors. Slice to your desired thickness and keep it simple with a spread of Cultured Salted 
Butter [sku 53720], or take things up a notch with slices of Société Roquefort [sku 89767] and a glass of Joseph 
Händler Riesling [sku 99461]. You'll find Organic Fig & Honey Batard in the bakery section through the

"079708","Sourdough Boules","Trader Joe's has all the shapes in our bakery section: circular bagels; slender baguettes; flat-breads... We thought 
it was about time we got around to boules. Trader Joe's Sourdough Boules not only bring their unique ball 
shape, but they also bring delicious bread that rises to so many excellent eating occasions.

Our Boules are made with a wild yeast Sourdough starter and long fermentation, to build a light, airy crumb-
and to yield the slightly nutty, slightly tangy taste that one expects from sourdough. The seven-ounce, round 
loaves-about five inches in diameter by three inches tall-are baked until the crust is golden brown and 
delightfully chewy, with a satisfying, open crumb.

All these traits mean Trader Joe's Sourdough Boules are great sliced and toasted for breakfast with TJ's 
Cultured Salted Butter [sku 53720] and Organic Reduced Sugar Strawberry Preserves [sku 95227]. For lunch, try 
some topped with a Teeny Tiny Avocado [sku 75444]. Speaking of shapes, you can cut a Boule into cubes and 
toast them for the best croutons you've ever had on your salad! And if soup is on the menu, why not turn your 
Boule in to a bowl, then fill it with TJ's New England Clam Chowder [sku 55218]. However you choose to enjoy 
it, you're guaranteed to have a Boule!

"078928","Sea Salt Chocolate Chunk Cookies","Imagine sinking your teeth into the perfect cookie: first, there's the initial toothsome resistance of the crisp 
outer layer, and the sweet aromas of butter and vanilla. Then, that resistance gives way to the soft, chewy 
interior and full flavors of semisweet chocolate, brown sugar, and sea salt. Imagine the chocolate and soft 
cookie melting in your mouth, expressing all kinds of sweet and savory flavors as you wash it down with a 
chilled glass of milk (or non-dairy beverage). Now, what if we told you that this exact experience is readily 
available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's? Imagine no more: we present to you The Sea Salt Chocolate 
Chunk Cookie.
 
Now made using an updated recipe that results in an even softer, even fresher-feeling texture, each box contains 
six Sea Salt Chocolate Chunk Cookies that are big in both size and flavor. In fact, they're just about the perfect 
size and shape for making delicious cookie ice cream sandwiches, and the bits of coarse, crunchy Sea Salt 
interact wonderfully with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576]. That said, if you're more in the 
mood for a simpler, solo Cookie experience, try warming one up in the microwave for a few seconds just prior 
to enjoying.

cookie's crisp outer layer. Then, just as that resistance gives way to the cookie's soft, chewy interior, you're hit 
with a symphony of buttery, brown-sugary, and, of course, chocolatey flavor. ""It's pitch-perfect!"" You exclaim. 
""We agree,"" we respond, ""and it's gluten free."" Shocked, you reach for the box, and there it is, plain as day: 
Trader Joe's Gluten Free Chocolate Chunk Cookies with Sea Salt. Well, I'll be darned...

Now made using an updated recipe that results in an even softer, even fresher-feeling texture, these Gluten 
Free Chocolate Chunk Cookies are a true achievement in gluten free baking. Each box contains six Cookies 
made with a blend of oat flour, rice flour, tapioca starch, brown sugar, and plenty of butter. The real scene-
stealers, however, are the rich, semi-sweet Chocolate Chunks throughout and the coarse Sea Salt sprinkled on 
top. Together, they offer up an effortless harmony of sweet and salty-it's the kind of Cookie confluence that'll 
bring you back for another bite. And another. And another-thank goodness we're selling them six to a box.

"077160","Gluten Free Baguette","In the world of bread, baguettes are serious business. In fact, the baguette has been deemed such an iconic part 
of France's culinary history, that the tradition of baguette-making was recently added to UNESCO's Intangible 
Cultural Heritage Lists, placing it in the same global esteem as Flamenco dance, Kabuki theatre, and yoga. With 
such a significant cultural presence, we thought it would be a shame if folks who don't eat gluten missed out on 
all the fun, which is why we're happy to introduce Trader Joe's Gluten Free Baguette to our bakery sections.

Made with a mix of tapioca starch and oat flour, as well as a bit of gluten free sourdough starter to give every 
bite a delightfully tangy, sourdough tinge, Trader Joe's Gluten Free Baguette strikes an artful balance between 
artisanal and rustic. We find it's best when warmed in an oven at 400°F for about ten minutes, after which its 
crust becomes particularly crisp, and the whole Baguette is ready for any situation that calls for a baguette. It 
makes an especially hearty sandwich bread (gluten-free bánh mì, anyone?), it makes great crostini when sliced 
into rounds and toasted, and can even just be torn or sliced into hunks and dipped with your favorite olive oil.

"079616","Pumpkin Loaf","Need something to help you step into the fall spirit? It's easy-all you need is Trader Joe's Pumpkin Loaf! 
It starts, unsurprisingly, with Pumpkin purée, which gives the wheat flour-based Loaf an incredibly moist 
and not too dense crumb. A parade of spices-cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves, to be exact-
intermingle with notes of vanilla to create the classic spice profile one would expect to find in autumnally-
inspired baked goods. Topping it off is a crowning layer of crunchy sugar and a generous dusting of aromatic, 
fall-forward spices, ensuring every bite is is imbued with the spirit of the season.
 
Almost as delightful as the Pumpkin Loaf itself is its open-and-enjoy nature-all you have to do is slice and 
serve, perhaps alongside a glass of iced Pumpkin Spice Flavored Cold Brew Concentrate Coffee [sku 79207] 
or a hot cup of Colombia Supremo Coffee [sku 50976]. If you've got a bit more time on your hands, you might 
toast a slice and  drizzle with Creamy Salted Almond Butter [sku 51436] and Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372]. 
Gilding the lily? Maybe. Scrumptiously satisfying? You bet! 

If all you need is Loaf, then make haste-these Pumpkin Loaves are limited to the fall season!

"053843","Dark Chocolate Ganache Mini Sheet Cake","Cake is too often relegated to special occasions. That's partially because it takes too much time and effort to bake 
one for 'no particular reason.' Of course, premade cakes are always an option, but what's typically available for 
purchase is either too fancy (and expensive) for everyday enjoyment, or just poor quality. Trader Joe's Dark 
Chocolate Ganache Mini Sheet Cake is the yummy solution for people who crave quality cake-even when it's 
nobody's birthday.

This cake is ""Mini""-about 6 servings. It's a single layer of moist, flavorful chocolate cake made with buttermilk 
for extra richness. A delicious Dark Chocolate Ganache icing (made with butter, cream, & cream cheese) is 
generously spread on top, adding a decadent touch to this simple cake. Our Mini Sheet Cake is casual and 
small enough that your family can enjoy it as a special treat anytime. It's also fancy and big enough to serve at 
an intimate dinner party. (And, you can always add candles and an icing-message on top for a mini-birthday

So, don't wait until it's someone's birthday before you enjoy your next slice of cake. Each 18-ounce Trader Joe's

With a kitchen-sink blend of seven seeds and grains, each slice ups the textural ante for toast and sandwiches. 

Sunflower kernels and flax & sesame seeds are gently roasted to amplify their nutty flavor before uniting with 
hulled millet and barley, rye, and oat flakes. The seeds and grains are then sprinkled on wheat flour dough, and 
the resulting Loaf-to-be undergoes a low and slow fermentation process that transforms it into a chewy, hearty, 
and texturally intriguing bread befitting the entire toast-to-sandwich spectrum.

Conveniently pre-sliced, Seedy Multigrain Loaf lets you skip the crumby fractions and zero in on culinary 
calculations. Organic Apricot Preserves [sku 75418] + Supreme Brie [sku 66562] + Oven Roasted Turkey Breast 
[sku 81594] = sophisticated weekday sandwiches. Mashed avocado + Nori Komi Furikake [sku 60255] + jammy

"078102","Brioche Style Liège Waffles","Did you know there is more than one kind of Belgian waffle? Breakfast eaters most often enjoy Brussels-style 
waffles, which are fairly large and rectangular with light, airy insides, and an exterior crunch-similar to Trader 
Joe's Belgian Waffles [sku 96967]. But another Belgian waffle has been gaining global fans in recent years, and it 
hails from the city of Liège. Trader Joe's Brioche Style Liège Waffles follow in this tradition.

Made for us in Belgium, our Liège Waffle dough not only includes flour, yeast, water, and salt-but also 
incorporates cultured butter, pearl sugar, and egg. This recipe yields a denser Waffle with buttery, brioche-like 
flavor. Compared to Brussels-style waffles, these are smaller and roundish, with rustic, uneven edges. And 
there's a distinct crunch that comes from the bits of sugar strewn throughout these handheld batter-cakes.

Waffle lovers will be enamored by the fact that Trader Joe's Brioche Liège Waffles can be enjoyed at room 
temperature, no toasting required. Enjoy them for an afternoon snack, as many Europeans do. Or grab one on 
your way out the door in the morning for a quick, satisfying breakfast. Of course, you can still opt to top them 
with whatever you like. Try serving some Brioche Style Liège Waffles after dinner with a sprinkle of powdered

and gluten enthusiasts alike. The newest member of the lineup is sweet, fruity, and beautifully blue-that's 
right, Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins are in the Bakery section for a limited time!

Let's start from the (muffin) top. These wheatless wonders mimic gluten's texture building properties thanks 
to a blend of cornstarch, tapioca starch, oat flour, and not one, but three types of rice flour. We combine this 
magical mixture with sour cream, a hint of natural vanilla flavor, and a smidge of lemon oil for a moist, tangy, 
and aromatic cake base that rivals its glutenous counterparts. 

There are no blueberry muffins without blueberries, and our Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins are chock full 
of 'em. Baking brings the berries to their sweetest, fruitiest, and bluest form for muffins that taste as vibrant 
as they look. Coarse sugar and oat streusel top off each muffin top with a bit of crunch and a boost of butter. 

Gluten Free Blueberry Muffins make for a sweet breakfast alongside smooth, medium roast coffee like Fair 
Trade Organic Breakfast Blend [sku 74368]. For a lemony twist, gently warm in the microwave or toaster oven

"079277","Carrot Mini Sheet Cake","Whose idea was it to put carrot in a cake anyway? In Medieval Europe, sugar was so inaccessible that the 
populace had to get creative with satisfying its sweet tooth. Abundant in quantity and sufficiently sweet, carrots 
got the job done-and then some. Not only did they contribute understated sweetness; they also increassed 
moisture content to keep desserts fluffy. Taking notes from both Medieval masses and grandmas of yore, 
Trader Joe's festively spiced Carrot Mini Sheet Cake evokes nostalgia with every bite. 

Shredded carrots and warm spices are baked together in a sweet and nutty base. Speaking of nuts, walnuts lend 
just enough bite to contrast the cake's moist and tender crumb. As with our mainstay Mini Sheet Cakes, cream 
cheese icing ribbons top off each slice with a tinge of tanginess and creamy texture. 

There's no baking or heating necessary for this scrumptious cake. Go right ahead and serve after weeknight 
dinners, add candles for birthday celebrations, or gift a whole sheet to the carrot cake lover in your life. 

Carrot Mini Sheet Cake is available in our bakery section for a limited time, so make haste to your neighborhood

Originating in Naples, pizza marinara is likely the oldest variety of tomato-topped pizza, and is the flavor profile 
we draw from for these unique Crackers. True to the source material, they're generously seasoned with the 
pizza marinara trinity of tangy tomatoes, aromatic oregano, and a kick of garlic. Thin, wheat-based Crackers 
stand in for pizza crust to facilitate satisfying crispiness, optimal snackability, and an uncanny resemblance to 
the real deal. 

To make the Crackers extra pizza-like, we recommend swinging by our cheese section and scooping up your 
cheese of choice-we're partial to All Natural Fresh Mozzarella Cheese [sku 077726]. Add cold cheese slices for 
a lighter feel, or melt them slightly for peak pizza replication. Pour a glass of Italian red wine (like Villa Cerrina 
Montepulciano D'Abruzzo [sku 048838]), or a pint of pilsner for elevated snackage during evening wind-downs 
and cozy gatherings with family and friends. Any way you slice it, Pizza Seasoned Crackers make for fun and

"052812","Chocolate Brooklyn Babka","Chocolate Brooklyn Babka is a sweet, swirly brioche-meets-cake loaf rooted in Eastern European Jewish 
traditions. In both Polish and Yiddish, ""babka"" is the diminutive of ""baba,"" meaning ""grandmother."" And the 
character of this sweet, fluffy, chocolate-laden cake lives up to its namesake-welcoming you with open arms 
and old-world charm, just as your baba would. 

Trader Joe's Chocolate Brooklyn Babka is made for us by a small, kosher bakery in-where else?-Brooklyn, 
New York that literally grew out of their grandmother's kitchen. Following time-honored recipes and baking 
methods, they make a real babka's Babka. It doesn't get much better. 

Crafted from scratch in small batches, the sweet yeast dough is spread with a rich chocolate filling and twisted by 
hand before it goes into a high loaf pan to be proofed and baked.  The rich veins of chocolate reveal themselves 
as swirls when the Babka is sliced. Beautiful. Delicious!

For those Seinfeldians in the crowd, you know that a Babka will make you a ""hero"" at a dinner party. For those 
who never watched the sitcom, take our word for it-it's a sensational dessert, fully of dessert heroism. Of 
course, if you want to champion breakfast, it's a sure thing, too. Great with a cup of coffee or a glass of chilled 
milk, served warm or at room temperature, ""You can't beat a Babka!"" And you can't beat our price on Babkas,

Tortillas is not that impressive. In fact, for someone watching their carbs, it's excellent! 

Carb Savvy Tortillas contain less overall carbs than regular tortillas, and the carbs they do contain are mostly 
from dietary fiber. Accordingly, these reduced-carb tortillas are an excellent source of dietary fiber, providing 
6g per tortilla. That's 21% of your daily recommended value of fiber! 

Enjoy them just as you would less-carb-savvy tortillas. Their smaller size is great for quesadillas, jumbo tacos,

    -Gilbert & Sullivan

Ah, spring. That time of year when nature reawakens, spreading boundless blossoms across the landscape-it's 
downright inspiring. In fact, it's inspired us to celebrate the season the best way we know how: with jammy 
shortbread cookies. Trader Joe's Lemon Flower Cookies are made for us by a trusted bakery partner, who starts 
with a base of beautifully buttery shortbread dough that's been flavored with lemon oil and colored a pastel 
yellow with turmeric. After shaping the dough into a fancifully floral shape and baking it to a flawlessly crumbly 
texture, they then fill the center with a lemon jam, so that every bite sings with a satisfyingly citric sweetness.

We invite you to join us in giving a toast to springtime by enjoying a Trader Joe's Lemon Flower Cookie with 
a cup of your favorite tea-ideally, something similarly citric, like our always-excellent Organic Earl Grey [sku 
62680]. They make a handsome addition to a spring-themed dessert board, especially when you have folks over 
for brunch. And for a truly auspicious sweet treat, we recommend placing a Lemon Flower Cookie or two (or 
three) into a bowl of our Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883] swirled with our Authentic Lemon Curd [sku 07850].

But why can't we have the best of both worlds? What if ciabatta was a baguette? And this baguette had all the 
enchanting qualities of ciabatta? Cue Trader Joe's Ciabatta Baguette, the best of both bread worlds.

The loaf is in the shape of a baguette (meaning ""wand"" in Italian), but the bread itself is ciabatta bread. Ciabatta 
dough contains a higher moisture content than traditional baguette dough-over 70% in this case-giving it 
a thin, slightly caramelized crust and a light crumb with large holes. Better yet, it's made with just a few in-
gredients: unbleached wheat flour, water, sea salt, yeast, and malted barley. Though our supplier makes large 
quantities of bread, they are still able to achieve the sought-after artisanal taste and texture. And, really, what's 
more artisan than the uniting of two esteemed artisan breads?

Slice as you would a baguette and dip to your heart's content, preferably in Sicilian Selezione Extra Virgin Olive 
Oil [sku 78296] and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena [sku 58036]. It also makes an excellent panini. Or, go the 
traditional route: use it to soak up extra sauce from a heaping bowl of spaghetti-ciabatta is famous for its ability 
to be dipped without falling apart. For a bit more crunch, place the bread in a 400¿F oven for a few minutes.

"076676","Danish Princess Pastry","When the weather heats up and turning on the oven loses its luster, you can still quell a craving for carbs 
with a visit to the bakery section at your neighborhood Trader Joe's. You'll find everyday staples like sliced 
breads, bagels, and tortillas, along with a seasonally rotating selection of muffins, cookies, and pastries-all for 
a fraction of the prices you might find elsewhere. Case in point: Trader Joe's Danish Princess Pastry.

Not to be confused with the Swedish sponge cake bearing the same name (who knew so many sweets were 
marked with this royal moniker?), Trader Joe's Danish Princess Pastry is made for us in Denmark, constructed 
of classic, tender pastry dough cradling a creamy, custard style, persipan-infused filling. (Fun fact: persipan is 
an aromatic confectionary ingredient used in baking, and as you might guess, akin to marzipan, but made with 
apricot kernels instead of almonds.) Rather than a single-serve round, this Danish is formed into an easy-to-
slice rectangle that can easily feed a crowd, and with a just-about-even ratio of pastry to filling, it's equally at 
home on a breakfast buffet or dessert platter. It can be enjoyed right out of the package, and if you can stand 
the heat, a 2-to-4-minute stint in the oven truly takes it over the top. Whether you enjoy your Pastry warm or 
cold, do as the Danes do and complement it with a strong, dark cup of coffee, like TJ's French Roast [sku 77083].

"077519","Sonora Style Flour Tortillas","While many taquerias across the Americas tend to default to corn tortillas, Sonoran cuisine is famed for its use 
of flour-and if you've ever had a Sonora-style street taco, you'll know exactly why. Perfectly pliant in texture, 
and with a mild, just slightly sweet flavor, a warm, Sonora-style flour tortilla can be a true revelation when 
paired with the right protein. After carrying Mini Sonora Style Tortillas [sku 73586] in our West Coast stores for 
a few years, we felt the time was right to bring this celebrated tortilla style to all our stores, which is why we're 
introducing these larger-sized Trader Joe's Sonora Style Flour Tortillas nationally.

Prudently proportioned for making hearty, filling fajitas, or marvelously melty quesadillas, our Sonora Style 
Flour Tortillas are a must-have for making all your favorites within the Mexican and Tex Mex culinary canon. 
And since each package contains 12  Flour Tortillas, that leaves a lot of room for experimentation, whether 
you choose to go elegantly simple (like a mini burrito with beans, rice, and grilled Carne Asada [sku 75977]) or

filling, then twisted into a round spiral before being baked to a glorious golden brown. Deliciously sweet (but 
definitely not too sweet), each bite has a lovely note of sugar and cinnamon spice, making this proper Danish 
a properly magnificent way to start your morning.

A bit like a cross between a cinnamon bun and a classic breakfast pastry, our Cinnamon Twist Danish can be 
enjoyed as-is, right out of the box, or slightly warmed in the oven or toaster. When heated, its cinnamon bun 
similarities are most prominent: you get that rich, warm, ever-so-slightly gooey cinnamon sugar flavor, which 
provides a perfect foil to the texture of the mutli-layered pastry. Try bringing one, along with fresh coffee or 
tea, to your next morning meeting: you'll be most popular person there. And at the value we're offering for each

Ticking those requisite boxes of tender, sweet, cakey, and moist, these rich, two-bite-sized Chocolate Donut 
Holes deliver everything you'd expect from a classic donut shop experience, right down to their shiny, sugary 
Glaze. Yet unlike the classic, they are dairy free and gluten free (the latter status earned thanks to a blend of 
tapioca starch, rice flour, and corn starch). Each package contains about 20 Donut Holes-more than enough 
to quell a donut craving or grant you ""best coworker ever"" status at your next breakfast meeting. But donut

it's time to prepare a royal engagement, because Trader Joe's Bake at Home Organic Garlic Bread is now 
available on our bakery shelves! Each hearty, rustic loaf comes pre-sliced, seasoned with a strikingly savory 
and herbaceous garlic Parmesan spread, and arrives in a vaccuum-sealed bag to ensure maximum freshness. 
Once home, all it takes is about 15 minutes in an oven pre-heated to 425°F (or atop a grill set to medium-high 
heat) before the crust becomes captivatingly crisp, the cheese spread turns marvelously melty, and the garlic 
grows alluringly aromatic.

While other ready-to-bake garlic breads tend to be on the softer side, Trader Joe's Bake at Home Organic 
Garlic Bread has a firm, chewy, almost ciabatta-like texture. In addition to helping hold the garlic Parmesan 
spread within its crumb structure exceptionally well, we find that this texture also makes it an even better 
accompaniment to soups and pastas. Try using a slice to sop up any extra sauce from our Spaghetti Carbornara

sugar coating would do-or, perhaps we should say, would snickerdoo. And wouldn't you know, the makers of 
our new Trader Joe's Snickerdoodle Cookies have snickerdone it!

Each box of Trader Joe's Snickerdoodle Cookies contains a dozen perfectly baked, scrumptiously cinammon-y 
Snickerdoodles, ready to be enjoyed whenever the Snickerdoodle mood strikes. (Please pardon the repetition; 
it really is just that fun to say.) Made from a traditional, homestyle recipe that includes cream of tartar for an 
extra crisp texture and korintje cinnamon for an even brighter touch of cinnamon spice in every bite, they 
make a great school or work lunch dessert, as well as a simple, anytime sweet treat. And we'd be remiss not to

Scandinavian pastries (which are currently experiencing a moment in the spotlight), and happens to play a 
starring role in our very own Trader Joe's Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns.

These limited-edition Sweet Rolled Danish Pastries are made in Denmark, where our supplier hand-forms 
the eggy dough into elegant knots, and incorporates plenty of Cardamom and Brown Sugar in the process. 
Once baked, the resulting pastry isn't overly sweet, allowing the heady spice notes to take center stage in each 
tender bite. Cozy up with a Bun and a cup of rich, dark roast coffee as an antidote to chilly winter weather-
they can be enjoyed right out of the package, or heated for a few minutes in the oven. Perhaps best of all, you 
can find packages of two, generously-sized Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns on the bakery shelves at your 
neighborhood Trader Joe's, for less than the price of one similar pastry elsewhere-if one can even be found!

"067823","Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bagels","There are few more effective ways to earn instant popularity than to show up at the office with an armful of 
bagels in the morning. Bagels just offer up that universal ""good morning; we're glad you're here"" vibe. And when 
the bagel that kickstarts your day just happens to be a really good bagel, well, even better.
 
Luckily, Trader Joe's Cinnamon Swirl Raisin Bagels are really good bagels. The secret to their bagel excellency 
is in the baking process. First, the cinnamon-y, raisin-studded dough is proofed and set out to ferment, which 
brings out all of its delicious, subtle flavors. Next, the bagels are kettle-boiled, which locks in a chewy center 
and creates that perfect bagel ""skin."" Then finally, they're off to the oven to be hearth-baked until they've 
acquired that perfect, golden-brown bagel crust.
 
Toast your Bagel and butter it up with TJ's Cultured Butter [sku 53720]. Or, if you prefer, slather it with TJ's 
Cream Cheese [sku 12491], then sprinkle it with cinnamon and sugar to really play up the Cinnamon Swirl. 
Your Bagel is a blank canvas; let your carbohydrate-saturated imagination run wild!

"076604","Petit Fours Mousse Cakes","In the 18th century, baking was a slightly more involved process than it is today. Back then, French bakers 
relied on ovens that took quite a long time to heat up, and even longer to cool down. So, after they were done 
making their breads for the day à grand fours (""at large oven,"" i.e., at full heat), they would take the opportunity 
to use their oven's residual heat to bake small, delicate pastries à petit fours (""at small oven,"" i.e., at diminishing 
heat). Though ovens have changed over the years, the fandom for petit fours cakes has only grown. We're 
certainly fans, which is precisely why we're introducing Trader Joe's Petit Fours Mousse Cakes to our bakery 
tables for the holidays.

Each package contains nine elegantly decorated, two-or-three-bite-sized Petit Fours Cakes in three distinct 
styles: three rich chocolate Cakes layered with silky chocolate Mousse, covered in a dark chocolatey coating; 
three vanilla Cakes layered with velvety vanilla Mousse, covered in a sweet vanilla coating and topped with 
pearl sugar; and three chocolate Cakes layered with smooth coffee Mousse, covered in a mocha coating and 
topped with bits of dark chocolate and sugar. Ideal for serving at holiday parties and get-togethers of all kinds, 
these light, sweet, and texturally refined Petit Fours Mousse Cakes make a great inclusion for a dessert table, 
a lovely host or hostess gift when visiting friends or family, and a delightfully decorative addition to an after-
dinner pie or cake plate after a holiday feast.

"069009","Vegan Gingerbread Loaf","Did you know? Some of the first recipes for gingerbread originated in Ancient Greece, over 2,000 years ago. 
These early versions were a little closer to honey-sweetened flatbreads than the pastry we know today, and they 
hardly had the architectural utility we currently enjoy in our Gingerbread House Kits [sku 11692], but the point 
remains: for millennia, people have known that good things happen when you bake ginger into your bread. 
This year, we reached out to a baker who knows this all too well, and knows how to do so without the use of 
any animal-based products. Once we had a chance to try it, we promptly made the decision to bring into our 
stores. And thus, Trader Joe's Vegan Gingerbread Loaf was born.

This Loaf has everything you'd want in a holiday gingerbread, like rich brown sugar, hearty molasses, and 
invigorating ginger. You can slice it and serve it right out of the package with a nice hot drink, like our Wintry 
Blend Coffee [sku 81829], or, if you're willing to go the extra mile, give it a quick toast and spread it with your 
favorite vegan butter or cream cheese. Mmm. For as long as we can keep it in stock, we're selling 15-ounce 
Trader Joe's Vegan Gingerbread Loaves for $4.29* each. Look for them in our bakery section.

"075006","Olive Fougasse","Etymologically derived from the same root word as focaccia, a fougasse is a traditional style of bread originating 
from southeastern France. Combining the satisfyingly chewy crumb structure of an Italian focaccia with the 
signature flair of French baking, fougasses where often just as practical as they were palatable, way back when: 
prior to the widespread use of thermometers, some bakers would use the time it took to fully cook a fougasse 
to determine how hot an oven was. Now, we can't speak to the temperature measuring abilities of Trader Joe's 
Olive Fougasse, the latest addition to our bakery section, but we can tell you that its crisp, delicious crust, light, 
airy interior, and generously distributed slices of Kalamata and black olives make for one seriously delicious, 
anytime bread.

Made in a fetching, four-sectioned design, which can be easily torn or cut into individual servings, our Olive 
Fougasse makes an excellent accompaniment to practically any meal. It can be served entirely on its own or 
with a bit of butter for spreading or olive oil for dipping, and can even be enjoyed as an especially flavorful 
bread for sandwiches. For an even crispier crust, we suggest giving it 3-4 minutes in the oven at 400°F, just 
prior to serving.

"028091","Pecan Pie","The pecan, like other members of the hickory genus, is not truly a nut, but is technically a drupe, a fruit with a 
single stone or pit, surrounded by a husk. The seed inside the husk is the rich, buttery ""nut"" that we consume, 
with great delight. Its name is a Native American word of Algonquin origin, and while the jury is still out on 
correct pronunciation (pe-CAN, PEE-can or puh-KAN, just to name a few), we think most would agree that the 
noblest use of the pecan is in the making of a classic Southern dessert, the Pecan Pie.

Trader Joe's Pecan Pie is an indulgent nod to culinary tradition. The custard base with butter and brown sugar 
is decidedly sweet, with notes of vanilla. Its soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture is the ideal counterpoint to the 
generous amounts of crunchy, buttery pecans added to each batch. The pie is baked just until set, creating a 
crispy outer crust and a gooey, caramelized center. Try it with Vanilla [sku 45883] or Chocolate Ice Cream [sku 
78572] for dessert (add a drizzle of chocolate syrup just before serving to double down on the decadence), or 
with a freshly brewed cup of French Vanilla Coffee [sku 51484] for a Saturday morning treat.

"077043","Raspberry Croissant Carré","Made for us in California by the best boulangers we've found this side of the Atlantic, Trader Joe's Raspberry 
Croissant Carré starts, as all good things do, with a classic laminated dough (a.k.a. dough that's been repeatedly 
folded with layers of butter to create the flaky Croissant eating experience). The dough is paired with a tart 
Raspberry filling that's been sweetened with a bit of sugar and complemented with a touch of lemon juice to 
further amplify the fruit. But rather than rolling them into the classic Croissant shape, the layers of dough 
are sandwiched around the jammy filling, like a coffee cake-a sedimentary construction that allows for the 
inclusion of much more filling than you'd find in an individual croissant. Merveilleux!

Sprinkled with coarse sugar crystals and baked until the dough reaches a lovely, deep golden hue, this impressive 
Carré (that's French for ""square,"" a nod to this pastry's squarish shape) serves six. Pick one up from the bakery 
shelf at your neighborhood Trader Joe's and enjoy right out of the package-it's a fantastic slice-and-serve 
option for a breakfast meeting or weekend brunch, paired with a steaming cup of coffee. To attain maximum 
deliciousness, remove the outer packaging and warm the Carré in a 350°F oven-you'll be rewarded with a 
fresh, French-style pastry, without the upscale bakery price tag you might find elsewhere. Bon appétit!

this year are Trader Joe's Chocolate Dipped Danish Cookies, made for us in-where else?-Denmark! Peek 
into the window of their upscale, bakery-style box, and you'll discover an equally fancy assortment of Danish 
Cookies: Marzipan Napoleon Hats, tender cookies filled with sweet, almond marzipan; Almond Triangles, 
made with a short crust base, an almond filling, and topped with sliced almonds; and classic, chewy Coconut 
Macaroons. And for good measure, the bottom of each Cookie is Dipped in rich Chocolate. Yum.

You probably don't need instructions for enjoying these delightful Danish Cookies, but we will say they pair 
famously with a strong cuppa, morning, afternoon, or night. For a very limited time, you'll find Chocolate 
Dipped Danish Cookies in the bakery section at your neighborhood TJ's, for a fraction of the price you'd pay 
at a Danish bakery (or a plane ticket to Denmark, for that matter).

"097438","Ciabatta Rolls","Not so very long ago, in 1982, a man in Verona, Italy invented ciabatta bread. He decided the loaf looked 
quite like his wife's slippers (the English translation of ciabatta), and so bread named after footwear was born. 
Even more recently, we decided to start selling such bread, like Trader Joe's Ciabatta Rolls (even though 
these are more like miniature slippers).

Ciabatta dough contains a high moisture content-over 70% in this case-giving it a thin, slightly caramel-
ized crust and a light crumb with large holes. Better yet, it's made with just a few ingredients: unbleached 
wheat flour, water, sea salt, yeast, and malted barley. Though our supplier makes large quantities of bread, 
they are still able to achieve the sought-after artisanal taste and texture. And, really, what's more artisan than 
miniature versions of an esteemed artisan bread?

Dip these tasty rolls to your heart's content, perhaps in Sicilian Selezione Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 78296] 
and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena [sku 58036]. Make little panini sandwiches with mozzarella, tomatoes, and 
basil. Or, go the traditional route: use it to soak up extra sauce after a heaping bowl of spaghetti-ciabatta is 
famous for its ability to be dipped without falling apart. For a crispy crust, place the bread in a 400¿F oven for 
a few minutes.

"077455","Teeny Tiny Apple Pies","The appeal of a freshly baked apple pie is undeniable. The making of said pie, however, with its finicky crust 
composition and long bake time (not to mention its large-serving format), often creates a roadblock to its 
enjoyment. Thankfully, sidestepping the prep and skipping straight to the eating is not a pie-in-the-sky plan-
it's actually quite possible with a trip to your neighborhood Trader Joe's and a box of Teeny Tiny Apple Pies.

Trader Joe's Teeny Tiny Apple Pies are made for us in Canada using sweet-tart, exceptionally juicy Northern 
Spy apples. Nestled in a flaky, buttery crust, the cinnamon-spiced, diced apple filling is topped with a brown 
sugar crumble and baked to a golden brown. The finished Pies are packed four to a box, each measuring 
about three inches in diameter, so you can enjoy their sweet, tender, apple-y goodness whenever a craving for 
pie presents itself-no fork or pie server required. (Think ""apple pie cookie"" and you're on the right track.) 
Alternatively, you could warm a Pie in the microwave or air fryer and serve it alongside a cup of Organic Fair 
Trade Breakfast Blend Coffee [sku 95142]. Or for a presentation that's sure to have you pie-eyed, go full à la 
mode and gild one with a scoop of Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883] and a flourish of Fleur

"069622","Pumpkin Brioche Twist","Trader Joe's Customers love our Sliced French Brioche [sku 56582]. This buttery, moist, and perfectly French 
braided bread is utterly appealing. With the holidays upon us, we thought, why not tweak the recipe a bit and 
come up with a pumpkin-y version. That could only be more appealing, right?!

Our supplier spent some quality time researching how to combine that brioche texture with the taste of smooth 
pumpkin for this Pumpkin Brioche Twist. Their time was well worth it-proved with one bite of the milky, 
soft-textured crumb and its pumpkin-tinged flavor. This holiday pumpkin profile is made complete by a swirl 
of pumpkin pie spices, which include cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.

A piece of this pre-sliced bread is seriously satisfying as-is, right out of the package. But we would be remiss 
if we didn't mention how amazing a lightly toasted, generously buttered piece tastes. Pumpkin Heaven! Find 
Trader Joe's 16.8-ounce Pumpkin Brioche Twist in our bakery section, and please note: it's only available for

"077107","Apple Cinnamon Buns","There are folks that are, naturally, morning people. And then there are those that, despite all efforts, are 
emphatically not. While we've never quite figured out the trick to complete morning person conversion, 
we've certainly found something that helps: a flaky, perfectly-baked morning pastry, like a Trader Joe's Apple 
Cinnamon Bun. These Danish-style pastries are made for us by (appropriately enough) a bakery partner in 
Denmark, who crafts each Bun by twisting sweet, cinnamon-apple-compote-filled dough into a quick knot, 
topping it with a light, streusel-like crumb, then baking it until it's gloriously golden brown. It's enough to make 
anyone aspire to morning person-hood.

While our Apple Cinnamon Buns can be enjoyed at room temperature, right out of the box, we find they reach 
new heights of texture, aroma, and flavor when lightly toasted just before serving. Similarly, while they can 
be eaten solo, they're especially delectable when served with a nice cup of tea or coffee, like our Organic Fair 
Trade Breakfast Blend [sku 95142]. Regardless of where you fall on the morning person spectrum, our Apple 
Cinnamon Buns are sure to delight-and their value is a real eye-opener, too.

"055476","Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread","As a snack, a simple slice of Cinnamon Raisin Bread approaches perfection. The sweet raisins and aromatic 
cinnamon make it seem like a special baked treat, one that's elevated even further by a simple warm up in the 
toaster. And yet, it's just a bit of bread-not a donut or a slice of cake-so it never quite corsses the line into 
""dessert"" territory!

We want all our customers to have the Cinnamon Raisin Bread experience, and that's why we're bringing 
Trader Joe's Gluten Free Cinnamon Raisin Bread back to our bakery shelves. Reformulated with a new recipe 
that no longer includes eggs (which means it's now also vegan!), this hearty loaf smells and tastes just like 
classic Cinnamon Raisin Bread-because it is! All we've done is replaced the wheat flour with a combination 
of brown rice flour and tapioca flour. Husked brown rice is finely ground and used as the primary substitute for 
wheat flour. The tapioca flour-derived from the root of the cassava plant from South America-helps provide 
some of the crispness and chew that's often missing in other gluten free breads.

This bread is great for breakfast, toasted with a spread of butter (or a bit of Trader Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread 
[sku 71782], to keep it totally vegan). Of course, it's also great with a variety of fruit or nut spreads, or try it 
egg-battered and pan-fried for a delicious French toast.

"051986","Sourdough Sandwich Bread","Toast sounds simple, and in a way, it is simple. But, when you consider that the source of good toast is really good 
bread, it suddenly sounds not so simple after all. After testing a wide variety of contenders, we've come to the 
unanimous decision that the very best bread for toast-making is sourdough. And because toast requires slices 
of bread, our conclusion also included the rationale that sliced Sourdough is the most practical Sourdough for 
this particular endeavor. And thus, Trader Joe's Sourdough Sandwich Bread tops our list of ""Best Breads for 
Toast"" for this and every year.

Our Sourdough Sandwich Bread is made exclusively for us, and will be slightly different depending on where 
in Trader Joe's country you pick up your loaf - the flavor of Sourdough depends largely on the ""starter,"" which 
is a living culture that lends the bread its signature sour profile. Because every starter is different, every bakery 
produces a slightly different flavor profile. What they all have in common is their excellence - especially when 
toasted. So slather on some butter, a bit of jam, or make a PB&J on Sourdough toast. You may even take that 
toasting to a higher level, and make a scrumptious grilled cheese... on Sourdough. Toast away. You'll be glad 
you did.

Our Cinnamon Sugar Bread is fluffy-yet-dense, sweet-but-not-too-sweet, and smoothly & superbly 
cinnamony. (The cinnamon flavor runs high, but since our supplier uses korintje cinnamon, it's a bit less 
""nippy"" than other cinnamon varietals.) And here's the plot twist: each loaf is actually made up of three separate 
pieces of dough, rolled in cinnamon & sugar, then Hand Twisted together. It's terrific toasted and, boy, does it 
make a fine French toast... and we've purposefully left it unsliced, so you can slice the bread to fit the breakfast!

Trader Joe's Whole Wheat English Muffins are not sweet muffins-if anything, they're a bit savory. Technically 
speaking, they're soft, slightly spongy (picture a sourdough-like texture), puck-shaped pieces of bread, 
horizontally bisected into two, equal, circular halves. Each Muffin has a toothsome exterior (more of a ""skin""

as well as sprouted millet, brown rice, and oats. In addition to providing an impressive two grams of fiber and 
three grams of protein per two-slice serving, this mix makes the bread soft and flavorful, instead of tough or 
grainy. In fact, we specifically chose this bread to appeal to non-gluten-free customers just as much as the 
gluten-free crowd. Because when it comes to bread, you shouldn't have to compromise.

We recommend toasting a few slices until nicely browned, then piling them high with your favorite deli meat

hearty nature and combine Crunchy Salted Almond Butter [sku 52293] with Fresh Raspberry Preserves [sku

it to be, technically, a small cake. If you've ever tried a Madeleine, that might not come as a surprise, as their 
mildly sweet flavor and soft, airy crumb are certainly as luxurious as any cake you'll find. That's especially true 
of Trader Joe's Gluten Free Madeleine Cookies, made for us by a bakery partner in France who uses just 
the right ratio of gluten free flours and starches to give each of these Madeleines the same superb flavor and 
captivatingly cake-like texture as you'd expect from their conventional counterparts at a Parisian patisserie. 
Talk about having your cake and eating it, too!

While our Gluten Free Madeleine Cookies can be enjoyed entirely on their own, as a solitary sweet treat 
or quick, post-meal dessert, we're particularly partial to serving them with a cup of coffee or tea. (Try them 
dunked in our French Roast [sku 57359] for an especially appropriate accompaniment.) And for an even more 
elevated eating experience (and a romantic dessert-for-two option), try dipping them in melted dark chocolate 
and sprinkling them with chopped Pistachios [sku 98684] or crushed Freeze Dried Strawberries [sku 80665].

"074781","BREAD CINNAMON RAISIN SLICED","We're not the types to say this kind of thing cavalierly, so believe us when we say that we may have found the 
greatest thing since sliced bread: Trader Joe's Sliced Cinnamon Raisin Bread! Made for us by a trusted bakery 
partner, each loaf contains a sweet, faintly spicy swirl of cinnamon sugar, and is studded with juicy, ever-so-
slightly tart raisins throughout. Once baked, our supplier cuts the loaf into thin, easy-to-portion slices that can 
be enjoyed for their super soft texture as-is, right out of the package, or toasted until they're lightly browned 
and satisfyingly crisp.

Sweet, cinnamon-y, and punctuated with occasional pops of flavor from the rich, juicy raisins, Trader Joe's 
Sliced Cinnamon Raisin Bread is sure to bring a bravura performance to the breakfast table. It serves 
excellently as a simple slice of toast, with a bit of butter or your favorite non-dairy spread. It's great for making 
thin and crisp slices of French toast that pair especially well with warm Maple Syrup [sku 04892] and Organic 
Powdered Sugar [sku 59227]. And for an intriguing mix of savory and sweet, try it as a sandwich bread with 
bacon, a fried egg, and a crispy Hashbrown [sku 94769] patty.

"073910","Gluten Free Strawberry Muffins","Like our everyday Gluten Free Double Chocolate Muffins [sku 74110], Trader Joe's Gluten Free Strawberry 
Muffins combine a gluten free flour blend (including white and brown rice flours, potato starch, and tapioca 
starch) with sweet cream buttermilk and sour cream to create one of the most marvelously moist muffins 
we've ever tasted, gluten free or otherwise. This seasonal Strawberry spin, however, trades the aforementioned 
chocolate for a warm vanilla and brown sugar-infused Muffin base, emboldened with plenty of sweet 
strawberries in every bite! 

This artful amalgamation of bright Strawberry flavor and moist Muffin-y goodness makes for a terrific on-
the-go breakfast alongside a hot cup of TJ's French Vanilla Coffee [sku 51484]. It also makes for a splendid end 
to your evening served à la mode, courtesy of a scoop of TJ's Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku

Mousse Flowers?! Nearly as beautiful-and most definitely tastier-than their botanical counterparts, these 
treats only pop up on our bakery shelves around this time of year, but, man, is the season sweet. 

First, we start with a layer of moist chocolate cake. A light, fluffy chocolate mousse comes next. Then, these two 
layers are coated in a sweet white chocolate that's been colored using turmeric powder and beet juice extract 
to give these blooms their bright yellow and pink colors. And that floral shape doesn't just happen by magic: a 
special water jet cutting technology is used to slice ever-so-perfect petals.

Because our Mini Chocolate Mousse Flowers are mini, they're perfect for sharing a package between friends. 
Enjoy one with TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576], or have one to brighten up a lingering rainy after-
noon.

Grab a bouquet of six Trader Joe's Mini Chocolate Mousse Flowers (a 4.5-ounce package) for $2.99, and only

"074736","Peanut Butter Brookie","A few years ago, we introduced a baked treat that dared to ask, ""if you love brownies, and you love chocolate 
chip cookies, why not enjoy both at the same time?"". The Brookie [sku 61281] was an instant hit, and its dual-
layered approach to dessert continues to be a consummate customer favorite to this day. So much so, in fact, 
that we felt the time was right to bring in another delectable doubleheader onto our shelves. Made for us by 
the same supplier as the adored original, Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Brookie takes the Brookie formula into 
a wonderfully nutty new direction.

To make each Peanut Butter Brookie, our supplier starts with a layer of rich, fudgy brownie batter, then tops 
it with a layer of sweet peanut butter cookie batter, complete with crunchy bits of chopped peanuts. After 
baking, they top it off with a sprinkle of sea salt to really round out that crunchy, salted peanut butter profile. 
With every bite, you get the classic flavor combo of chocolate and peanut butter, plus the extra dimension of a 
satisfyingly soft, just done cookie-brownie texture. Enjoy this Peanut Butter Brookie as an anytime sweet treat,  
straight out of the package, or, for something a little more involved, we're especially fond of it warmed up and 
topped with a scoop of ice cream...

"075248","Blueberry & Lemon Hand PIes","When it comes to pies, bold fruit flavors and buttery, flaky crusts go hand in hand. And in Trader Joe's 
Blueberry & Lemon Hand Pies, you'll find both-handily! Made for us by the same brilliant bakery partners 
behind our fall-seasonal Apple Pumpkin Hand Pies [sku 74773], each bite of these hearty, hand-hold-able Pies 
is bursting with fresh blueberry (it's the first ingredient listed, in fact!) and sweet-tart sugared lemon, supported 
by an expertly crafted all-butter crust.  

Just as the name implies, Trader Joe's Blueberry & Lemon Hand Pies can easily be eaten sans knife and fork, 
making them an excellent option for packing along on picnics, adding to school or work lunches, or simply 
just enjoying on the go. That said, for those who prefer a slightly more involved experience, warming them up 
for a few minutes in the oven or air fryer will definitely be worth your while-especially with the addition of a 
dollop of whipped cream or scoop of your favorite ice cream. Just be sure to pick them up while we still have

"075817","Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread","If you'll allow us a moment of potential over-earnestness, there really is something magical about the act of enjoying 
a meal with folks that you love. It's a shared moment in every sense of the word: you're sharing time and space in 
addition to sharing nourishment. So when we find a food that brings the idea of sharing to the fore, as our tear-
and-share Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread does, it holds a special place in our hearts. Call us romantics if you 
must-just don't call us late to the dinner table.

To make Trader Joe's Cheddar Jalapeño Pull Apart Bread, our supplier makes a fluffy, airy, almost focaccia-like 
dough, sprinkles it generously with shredded cheddar and sliced jalapeño peppers, then chops it into roll-sized 
pieces. After that, they cobble the pieces together in a tray and bake them just enough for you to finish the job at 
home. Out of your oven, the bread becomes delightfully warm, the cheese wonderfully gooey, and the jalapeños 
satisfyingly crisp. From there, you and anyone else you're sharing a meal with are free to pull the pieces apart and 
enjoy-together. It makes an excellent appetizer option, especially when combined with a fun dipping sauce like our 
Organic Ranch Dressing [sku 56051], and a delightfully spicy dinner roll option, too.

"061251","Mini Chocolate Mousse Presents","Back in 2015, we introduced a pastry that was set to be come somewhat of a phenomenon in our bakery section: 
seasonal Chocolate Mousse Eggs [sku 54742]. Our tasting panel loved these little eggs-thick layers of moist, 
rich chocolate cake topped with silky chocolate mousse and enrobed in Belgian chocolate-and as it would 
turn out, so did our customers. So, we thought, Why limit these mini Mousse cakes to just one season? Enter 
fall-focused Chocolate Mousse Pumpkins [sku 55381], and holiday-themed Mini Chocolate Mousse Trees [sku 
57283], also a big hits with our customers. 

This holiday season, though, we're replacing the Trees with Presents. They're the same high-quality mousse cakes 
you love (some say they taste like an upscale version of a certain individually-wrapped, American convenience 
store classic), shaped like perfect little rectangles and all tied-up with a white chocolate ""ribbon"" and ""bow."" 

The dictionary defines a presents as ""things given to someone as gifts,"" and Trader Joe's Mini Chocolate Mousse 
Presents are the perfect gift for anyone you're sweet on. In the spirit of the season, we suggest picking up a 
package or two (or three, or four, or five...) to share with your friends and family; partners and pals; colleagues 
and countrymen. We're selling each 6-present, 5-ounce tray for $2.99. At less than fifty cents a Present, this 
might be the least expensive gift you'll give all year! You'll find Mini Chocolate Mousse Presents on our bakery 
tables, while the season is upon us.

"069011","Gingerbread Sandwich Cookies","What could be better than a perfectly spiced, luxuriously soft-textured, rich and molasses-y gingerbread? 
How about two pieces of gingerbread sandwiching a delicious layer of sweet vanilla frosting? That's exactly 
what we did with Trader Joe's Gingerbread Sandwich Cookies, the latest seasonal selection to grace our 
bakery department. Our supplier starts with soft-baked gingerbread cookies that are topped with coarse 
sugar crystals to give them some extra sweetness and a satisfying crunch. They then take two of those 
cookies and place in between them a generous layer of frosting made with butter, cream cheese, and real 
vanilla beans from Madagascar. 

Let us put it this way: bite after bite, these Sandwich Cookies deliver on all fronts. Aromatically, you get 
all those nostalgia-invoking holiday spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and (of course) ginger. Texturally, you 
get the crunch of the sugar, the satisfyingly teeth-sinking tenderness of the Cookie's interior, and then 
that phenomenally fluffy frosting at the center. As for taste? These might as well be hand-holdable slices of 
gingerbread cake. If there's one way to improve upon that, it's our fantastic retail: for the rest of the holiday 
season, we're selling 20 ounce boxes of Trader Joe's Gingerbread Sandwich Cookies, each containing about 
18 sandwich cookies, for $4.99*. Wow.

"057284","French Apple Tart","For some Thanksgiving eaters, a perfectly cooked, artfully carved turkey makes the meal. For others, it's just 
an obstacle standing in the way of the real feast: dessert. Either way, whether it's the sweet or the savory side of 
Thanksgiving that piques your palate, our French Apple Tart will have you saying, More, s'il vous plaît!

To create this masterpiece of a Tart, our supplier takes a buttery apricot and apple filling (made with sweet 
Northern Spy apples and tart Granny Smiths), nestles it in a shortbread crust, tops it with a fan of even more 
sliced apples, and finishes it with a light, apricot glaze. A thing of rustic beauty. 

Now, you might raise an eyebrow when you notice that our French Apple Tart is made here in the U.S.A., but 
before you raise that other eyebrow, consider this: the Master Pastry Chef who developed this recipe once made 
this exact tart-which is constructed and baked according to French tradition-for the President of France 
himself. Spoiler alert: he loved it. 

At $7.99 for each 20 ounce tart, you will love it, too. Find it on our bakery aisle.

"061115","Pumpkin Pie","The forerunner of what is known as ""traditional pumpkin pie,"" was a hollowed-out pumpkin filled with milk, 
honey, and spices-sometimes even apples. As good as that might've tasted, it sounds a bit unwieldy to eat. And 
from a pie-seller's perspective, we weren't sure we knew best how to package such an item.

Suffice it to say, we're sticking with the tried-and-true: a pie crust filled with pumpkin custard. Nearly everyone 
is familiar with that classic, sublime combination of pumpkin purée, milk, sugar, spices. And each 9"" Trader 
Joe's Pumpkin Pie is made with real, fresh pumpkin purée and spiced with ground cinnamon, ground ginger, 
& cloves. This silky, custardy filling gets nestled in a tender, flaky crust, then baked to perfection.

This Pumpkin Pie is traditional in every sense, and though it may not be made from scratch by you, it is made 
from scratch by our supplier, for you. Whether you serve it cold with a scoop of our Pumpkin Ice Cream [sku 
95253], or gently warmed with a dollop of whipped cream (made from our Organic Heavy Whipping Cream 
[sku 72300]), you'll find the experience to be just what you'd hoped for-silky-smooth, seasonally spiced, and 
sweetly satisfying.

Get your own 27-ounce Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie for $5.99-an incredible value for an incredible pie. Find it

and delicious, you wouldn't think they're gluten free. What you may not know (but you will in a second), is 
that this fall we're bringing in another, winning, Gluten Free Muffin flavor. Are you ready for Triple Ginger?!

Similar to our other iterations, these Gluten Free gems are made with that magical flour blend, including white 
and brown rice flours, potato starch, and tapioca starch. And as in the other recipes, sour cream and lowfat 
buttermilk ensure a seriously soft, meticulously moist crumb. What's unique in this recipe is the gingery trio, 
which includes ginger purée, candied ginger, and crystallized ginger. (Truth be told, there's also ground ginger, 
but ""Quadruple Ginger"" just doesn't have the same rhapsodic ring.) At any rate, this generous amount of ginger 
presents a pleasantly piquant kick, balanced by brown sugar and molasses.

"074908","Apple Crumble Pie","While you might think pumpkin pie is the top pick for Thanksgiving Day dessert, as it turns out, the almighty 
apple consistently earns the highest marks in myriad un-scientific surveys on the subject. And it makes sense-
fall is peak apple season, with fresh crops coming off the trees by the bushel, their sweet-tart flesh and delicious 
crunch ready to elevate the ever-so-humble pie crust to another level entirely. Trader Joe's Apple Crumble 
Pie is a prime example of such pie perfection. Its filling of tender, Northern Spy apples is imbued with warm 
cinnamon, and nestled between an all-butter pastry crust shell and a crunchy, buttery oat crumble topping 
with notes of brown sugar. It can be warmed in the oven while you enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner, or served at 
room temperature with a cup of coffee the next morning. And at eight inches in diameter, it can easily serve 
six dinner guests (with or without a scoop of TJ's Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883]). Apple 
Crumble Pie for the win!

Just as the name implies, our Apple Pumpkin Hand Pies can be enjoyed sans knife or fork, making them quite 
convenient for picnics, work lunches, or as an anytime, on-the-go indulgence. If you're looking to take things

of cafés and autumn bake sales with Trader Joe's Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread, a sweet, hearty loaf made with 
plenty of pumpkin (it's the first ingredient, in fact) and plenty of pumpkin spice, which just also happens to be 
gluten free, too.

With its slightly cake-y texture and delightfully spiced flavor profile, this Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread makes 
for a great sweet snack any time of day, but we particularly like in a crisp autumn or winter morning with a cup 
of coffee or tea. Try it warmed, or even lightly toasted, with a pat of butter, some sweetened cream cheese, or 
a fall-inspired spread, like our Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372]. Like the season itself, this Gluten Free Pumpkin

texture and slightly tangy flavor from real apple cider. They're delightful on their own, and even better alongside 
a piping-hot mug of coffee, tea, or¿ TJ's Spiced Cider [sku 42371].

We're selling each 15.9-ounce box of six Apple Cider Donuts for $3.99. That's farmstand quality at an out-
stand-ing price-we're talking less than 70¢ per Donut. You'll find them in our bakery section.

"054292","Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread","Several years ago, we began offering Udi's gluten free breads in response to many customer requests. It was 
obvious from the beginning why they were asking for it-Udi's line of gluten free breads tasted closer to ""regular"" 
bread than anything else we tried¿ until now¿

Introducing Trader Joe's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread. In several ways, our new bread is very similar 
to Udi's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread. Both are dairy-, soy-, nut-, and gluten-free. Both are made using no 
artificial flavors and no synthetic colors. Both are made with brown rice flour. But, our new Gluten Free White 
Sandwich Bread offers even more. Along with the brown rice flour, our bread also made with sorghum (in the 
grass family, cultivated for grain), and potato flour. These ingredients help give our bread a better texture and 
flavor than Udi's (according to our official taste-testers). Also, slice for slice, Trader Joe's Gluten Free White 
Sandwich Bread is lower in fat, with fewer calories. And like its predecessor, our bread is still cholesterol-free, and 
with zero saturated fat and zero trans fat.

When it comes to actually eating it, we wouldn't hesitate to use it for any ""regular"" bread occasion. Toast it. Grill 
it for French toast or a toasted cheese sandwich. Use it fresh out of the bag for a cold sandwich. You could even 
blend it to make your own breadcrumbs!

Our approach to providing our customers with real value is pretty simple: Whenever we can offer a better product 
at a better price, we will. Trader Joe's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread is a perfect example of this philosophy 
in action. This bread is better, and it is, indeed, offered at a better price-each twelve-ounce sliced loaf is just 
$4.49.

"073564","Vegan Brioche Loaf","There's a reason that bakers take great pride in their brioche. Rich, fluffy, and full of buttery sweetness, a good 
brioche is as elegantly delicious to eat as it is tricky to make - and it's even trickier if you're making a totally 
vegan version. Luckily, we know some of the best bakers in the business, and they've made a pre-sliced, plant-
based Vegan Brioche Loaf exclusively for us, and one that's fit to be the crown jewel of any bakery - vegan 
or not!

Made with an ingeniously crafted plant-based butter that's derived from a mix of coconut oil, cocoa butter, 
and sunflower oil, every slice of Trader Joe's Vegan Brioche Loaf is soft and mildly sweet, with just the kind 
of light and tender crumb texture that brioche is celebrated for. It can be used in any and all applications you'd 
normally find for sliced bread, including your morning toast or a school lunch sandwich, and also makes a 
great basis for more advanced treats like French toast, bread pudding, or crunchy homemade croutons.

Buns are good-sized buns made with unbleached wheat flour, and, boy, do they deliver. Soft and fluffy, with just 
the right amount of chew: you wouldn't want any other bun to support your burger.

While a burger (think: Grassfed Angus Beef Burgers [sku 50723], Simply Seasoned Tuna Burgers [sku 54638], 
Chile Lime Chicken Burgers [sku 15261], etc.) is the typical filling for these Buns, why stop there? Wine Country

'em with anything! How will you use them?

"061281","Brookie","As dessert trends go, it seems that the more outlandish the creation, the less focus there is on the taste and 
enjoyment of the dish at hand (bespangled, unicorn-inspired baked goods come to mind)-not to mention the 
fact that such famed food fads are often accompanied by an equally outlandish price tag. Preferring to proffer 
pastries that deliver on both quality and price, our product developers continuously work to separate the wheat 
from the chaff in the trendy dessert world, to bring only the best to our bakery shelves-desserts like Trader 
Joe's Brookie.

Made for us by an Ohio baker with a reputation for brownie brilliance, Trader Joe's Brookie is a mouth-
watering mash-up of two timeless desserts. The bottom layer is all brownie-a rich dark brown batter, with 
sweetly fragrant cocoa notes and a pleasantly fudgy chew. That beautiful brownie batter is topped with a layer of 
golden cookie batter that's speckled with sweet chocolate chips, and the whole thing is baked to perfection-in 
this case, perfection is defined as a slightly soft, tender center with a gloriously chewy edge. And because this 
rectangular bar of Brookie goodness is conveniently pre-cut into eight servings, you'll get a sweet, soft center 
and chewy edge, no matter which piece you eat.

Speaking of eating, Trader Joe's Brookie is a two-in-one treat that can fly solo as a sweet snack, or share the 
limelight warmed up, alongside a simple scoop of TJ's Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 45883]-
no glitter required. We're selling each 11-ounce package for $3.99, two dollars lower than trendy bakery prices.

"066433","Brioche Hot Dog Buns","Soft, buttery, and with a shiny, golden-brown crust, brioche is one of those breads that, by its very nature, adds 
a little touch of elegance to whatever it's served with. As proven by our beloved Brioche Buns [sku 61752], 
the sweet, luxuriously-textured profile of brioche is remarkably well-suited to complementing the constituent 
ingredients of a hamburger, which got us thinking: couldn't that principle be applied to hot dogs, as well? And 
thus, Trader Joe's Brioche Hot Dog Buns came to be.

Combining all the fluffiness and mild sweetness of brioche with all the form and function of a hot dog bun 
means taking hot dogs to the next level. Imagine surrounding a plump, pan-fried Organic Uncured Grass Fed 
Beef Hot Dog [sku 76253] with pillowy brioche, the softness of the bread contrasting with the snap and dense 
texture of the hot dog...Mmm. But one need not limit their imaginations to just hot dogs - these Buns also 
work wonders for fried fish, hot chicken, egg salad, or lobster rolls. Frankly, anything grilled, crispy, creamy, or 
somewhere in between will find a happy home inside Trader Joe's Brioche Hot Dog Buns.

to both sweet and savory applications. One of our favorite applications? Burgers on Brioche Buns! 

Trader Joe's Brioche Buns are made for us by bakers who really know their brioche. Eggy, extra moist, and 
free from artificial preservatives, they're the perfect base for your burger or support for your sandwich. Load up

"071149","Lemon Zest Madeleine Cookies","There is plenty of folklore and legend associated with Madeleines. Some say that these soft, cake-like cookies 
were first baked in Lorraine, France and named after a central character in the region's history. Others allege 
that they were named after the French woman who first discovered them on a pilgrimage to Compostela, 
Spain. Regardless of where they came from, we know this much is true: the popularity of the classic madeleine 
endures. And our Trader Joe's Madeleine Cookies [sku 35784] are so good, we thought it made perfect sense to 
offer seasonal, Trader Joe's Lemon Zest Madeleine Cookies, too! 

Our Lemon Zest Madeleine Cookies are made for us by a Northern California bakery that has specialized in 
baking madeleines for over 40 years, using classic, simple ingredients, like flour, sugar, butter, and eggs. For 
our Lemon Zest Madeleines, they use real, candied lemon zest to add a kick of citrus. The result is a bright and 
sunny Madeleine that's soft, moist, buttery, and cake-like. And, per tradition, they're baked in scalloped molds, 
giving them that distinctive, fancy shell shape that makes a Madeleine a Madeleine. You'll find these fancy 
cookies-at a not-so-fancy price-in our bakery section.

"074110","Gluten Free Double Chocolate Muffins","When our now-very-popular Cinnamon Coffee Cake Muffins [sku 70524] were first presented to our tasting 
panel, the fact that they are gluten free was not mentioned until after everyone announced how incredibly 
yummy they are. Many of those panel members had experienced less-than-scrumptious gluten free bakery 
items in the past, so they were genuinely surprised that a gluten free muffin could be so ridiculously good.

When it was time to consider Gluten Free Double Chocolate Muffins, we couldn't trick them a second time. 
But that didn't matter. The response was just as jubilant-perhaps even more so, because, you know... chocolate!

Like the Coffee Cake version, these Chocolate Muffins are made with a gluten free flour blend, which includes 
white and brown rice flours, potato starch, and tapioca starch. But the real key to making these Gluten Free 
Muffins (and our other versions) so delicious is the inclusion of sweet cream buttermilk and sour cream, which 
contribute a decadently moist texture. Of course, these particular Muffins also have the bonus of both cocoa 
and chocolate chips!

"063164","Gluten Free Almost Everything Bagels","Ah, the march of progress. Since we first started carrying gluten-free bread, those many years ago, remarkable 
advances have been made in the field of gluten-free baked goods: softer consistencies, more open-crumbed tex-
tures, and even improved flavors from alternative grains. As these gluten-free breakthroughs have taken place, 
we've kept apace, offering the best options available to our customers as soon as we could find them. And now, 
we're proud to say we're staying on the cutting edge with Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Everything Bagels.

Trader Joe's Gluten-Free Everything Bagels are made for us in a dedicated gluten-free facility, using a special 
blend of brown rice flour, potato flour, tapioca starch, and potato starch-plus a bit of garlic, sea salt, expeller 
pressed canola oil, and cane sugar. Once baked, they're rolled in a blend of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and bits 
of dehydrated onion-now that's Everything. In addition to providing an impressive-for-a-bagel four grams of 
protein per serving, this special blend of gluten free flours and starches makes these bagels soft and chewy, rather 
than gritty and grainy. In fact, we specifically chose these bagels to appeal to non-gluten-free customers just as 
much as the gluten-free crowd. Because when it comes to carbs, you shouldn't have to compromise.

We recommend toasting at once! Enjoy it plain, buttered, or with a bit of cream cheese. We're selling 14-ounce 
bags of four Trader Joe's Gluten Free Blueberry Bagels for $4.49 each. Be a mensch and buy a bunch! You'll

to supplement our everyday confections. And since these dense, decadent Hearts are so scrumptious, we've 
decided to bring them back in April for Mother's Day, too!

These heart-shaped cookies are made using wheat and malted barley flours. Their alluring texture is soft and 
crumbly, with that classic, sweet, shortbread taste, and a hint of almond flavor. Sandwiched between two of 
them is Raspberry jam, which can be seen peeking through a little ""window"" on the top.

We know what you're thinking; You're thinking of that gummy, coagulated ""jam"" that fills lesser cookies. Erase 
that image from your mind. We're talking about the very best raspberry jam a jam-maker could make-made 
and flavored with real raspberries, not artificial raspberry flavor.

Trader Joe's Raspberry Hearts come in a lovely window-box, so that whomever you gift these to can see your

"065569","Glazed Sour Cream Donuts","There's plenty of squabble over who exactly ""invented"" the donut. One of the more amusing origin stories we've 
come across traces it back to an American sea Captain Hanson Gregory. The story goes that, on a particularly 
choppy voyage, Capt. Gregory saw no reason he shouldn't be able to steer his ship with both his hands and enjoy 
his favorite baked good at the same time-so he impaled the round, cake-like creation on his steering wheel. 
You know, like any logical sea Captain would. 

We can't say whether that's fact or fiction, but we can whole-heartedly empathize with Capt. Gregory's extreme 
donut devotion. We, too, are known to sail the (culinary) seas, and we, too, LOVE donuts. In fact, the reason we've 
held off so long on introducing an everyday, Trader Joe's donut in our stores is that we simply couldn't find a donut 
deserving of our name¿until now. Ladies & gentlepeople, meet Trader Joe's Glazed Sour Cream Donuts.

Made for us by the same family-owned, New England bakery that produces our seasonal Apple Cider Donuts 
[sku 64320] (a customer fall fave), Trader Joe's Glazed  Sour Cream Donuts are the donuts of our dreams. 
They're the kind of absurdly good, old-fashioned style donuts that you're just not supposed to find at a grocery 
store-but you'll find them at ours! These classic, ring-shaped Donuts are dense, cakey, moist, & extra fluffy 
(thanks to the inclusion of  Sour Cream in their batter), and they're smothered in a sweet, slightly vanilla-
flavored glaze. They're packaged by the half-dozen in kraft-paper boxes (just like at the donut shop!), and 
they're gosh-darn delicious. We're sure Capt. Gregory would agree.

obvious hole in our breakfast-friendly pumpkin proffering - Pumpkin Bagels. Partnering with a bakery 
proficient in pumpkin, we set to work on this new seasonal freshly-baked bagel special. We used pumpkin 
flour, milled from fresh pumpkins, to make sure the pumpkin flavor was pronounced. Adding a carefully 
measured blend of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger - the essence of pumpkin pie - we brought the right 
balance of subtly sweet squash and warm seasonal spices into the soft chewy roll with a hole. It was no easy 
feat, but it was worth it. 

Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bagels make a celebrated Fall breakfast, especially when toasted with a layer of 
Pumpkin Cream Cheese, Plain Cream Cheese (with Honey) or Apple Butter. Add a hot cup of Pumpkin 
Spice Coffee or Pumpkin Spice Chai Tea Latte, and the season simply hugs you. They also makes 
outrageous BLTs using our Applewood Smoked Bacon.  Or, for something more dessert-y, try our Pumpkin

"069342","Pumpkin Blondie Brownies","Everybody love a good brownie. Who wouldn't love rich, moist, cake-like chocolate that is baked just enough 
to not be batter anymore! But what about blondies? The case can be made that blondies are more fun, and we 
think this is even more true when pumpkin is involved. Trader Joe's Pumpkin Blondie Brownies certainly 
make the case!

These bakery gems sport a warm, autumnal brown, befitting the season. Like their chocolatey cousins, these 
Blondie Brownies are, indeed, super-moist with a cake-like texture. However, instead of chocolate, these are 
Pumpkin-forward and paired with perfect pumpkin partners, namely: cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. We also 
include pieces of pecans and white chocolate chips. To top it all off is a Pollock-like drizzle of royal icing. But 
don't be fooled¿ there's nothing abstract about this dessert. Ease a bite-sized square of Trader Joe's Pumpkin 
Blondie Brownies into your mouth and you'll immediately experience Pumpkin Blondie heaven, as tangible 
as a bakery treat can be! 

Find each nine-ounce package of about eight, bite-sized Pumpkin Blondie Brownies on our bakery tables, but 
only for a limited time.

"065759","Cinnamon Brooklyn Babka","Trader Joe's Cinnamon Brooklyn Babka is a  zesty, swirly, brioche-meets-cake loaf rooted in Eastern European 
Jewish traditions. In both Polish and Yiddish, ""babka"" is the diminutive of ""baba,"" meaning ""grandmother."" 
And the character of this sweet, fluffy, streusel-topped cake lives up to its namesake-welcoming you with 
open arms, old-world charm - and just a bit of spice - just as your baba would.

Made for us by the same supplier as our much-beloved Chocolate Brooklyn Babka [sku 52812], this deftly 
sweet,  luxuriously soft pastry achieves the same impeccable texture and fluffiness as its Chocolate counterpart, 
but delightfully swings for a different flavor profile. Each layer of rich, soft dough is filled with zesty cinnamon 
and sugar, giving it a charmingly lively, slightly savory character. And if that weren't enough, each 18-ounce 
Cinnamon Babka is topped with a bit of crumbly streusel. 

Like a coffee cake, a cinnamon roll, and a brioche bun all rolled (or, should we say, braided) into one, our 
Cinnamon Brookyln Babka has that all-too-rare quality of a pastry: it works just as well as a breakfast treat as 
it does for an afternoon tea or an after-dinner treat. Keep an eye out for our them on our bakery tables.

"070453","Gluten Free English Muffins","Don't order an English Muffin in England, as you will likely get a funny look: Like the ""French"" in ""French

of said moniker from traditional, American-style muffins. (You know, the sweet, cake-like ones famously 
peddled in nursery rhymes by the Muffin Man¿ do you know him?) 

Trader Joe's Gluten Free English Muffins are not sweet muffins-if anything, they're a bit savory. Technically 
speaking, they're slightly spongy (picture a sourdough-like texture), puck-shaped pieces of bread, horizontally 
bisected into two, equal, circular halves. And, being that they're gluten free, they're made from a blend of 
rice flour, tapioca starch, and chickpea flour rather than the regular, wheat-based stuff. Each Muffin has a 
toothsome exterior (more of a ""skin"" than a ""crust,"" though), and an interior filled with plenty of...well, lest 
we infringe upon on any trademarks, we'll say they're filled with plenty of ""pockets & crevices."" Yes, that's it.

"063483","Vegan Banana Bread with Walnuts","Since its popularization in the 1930's, Banana Bread's sweetness, softness, and simplicity have given it legendary 
status among comfort foods. To this day, Banana Bread consistently ranks in the top ten searched-for recipes 
online every year, and even our very own Banana Bread Mix [sku 85218] and Banana Bonanza Bread [sku 00163] 
have remained beloved fixtures on our shelves for close to a decade. With such a storied history, what could be 
next for this crown jewel of comfort? Look no further than Trader Joe's Vegan Banana Bread with Walnuts, 
a perfectly sweet and soft-textured Banana Bread, achieved without the use of dairy or eggs (or, of course, any 
other animal products).

Whenever we introduce a vegan version of an existing product, we always make sure that it will appeal to non-
vegans as well-our philosophy being that when it comes to comfort food, you shouldn't have to compromise. 
We're happy to report that Trader Joe's Vegan Banana Bread passes this test with flying colors, boasting a 
fabulously sweet banana-walnut flavor and dense, moist texture. Every soft, flavorful bite gives in nicely, without 
any of the rough or gritty consistency that you can occasionally encounter in certain other ""alternative"" breads.

Whether you enjoy it alone, as it is, by the slice, or you enhance your experience with a bit of Crunchy Almond 
Butter [sku 91989] (which we especially recommend if you pop it in your toaster oven for a bit, first), Trader 
Joe's Vegan Banana Bread with Walnuts is our uncompromisingly delicious, comprehensively comforting, and 
veritably vegan take on a classic baked treat. And as pleasantly sweet as that sounds, here's something even 
sweeter: We're selling each 16-ounce loaf for $3.99.

"052370","Pretzel Bagels ","Traditionally, pretzels have knots-or at least, a twist. Trader Joe's Pretzel Bagels do not have knots. Perhaps, 
that's the twist. 

After seeing the popularity of our Soft Pretzel Sticks [sku 90301], we decided it was time to bring the Pretzel 
Bagel around. Speaking of a round, that's the shape-a circle with a hole, like your typical bagel. But, unlike 
the typical bagel, our Pretzel Bagels have a glossy, brown color, and a yeasty, slightly salty, distinctly pretzel-ly 
flavor. 

Sliced in half, these make a great Reuben-especially with Trader Joe's Uncured Sliced Corned Beef [sku 
54132]-or a breakfast sandwich, the kind layered with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and ham or bacon. 
Make an afternoon snack by warming up a Pretzel Bagel whole in a 350ºF oven for 5 minutes, brushing it 
with a little water or butter, and sprinkling the warm top with TJ's Sea Salt [sku 34805]. Don't forget to dip it in 
TJ's Spicy Brown Deli Style Mustard [sku 94640]. Of course, it's also excellent toasted with cream cheese.

Each eighteen-ounce bag of six Trader Joe's Pretzel Bagels is $2.49. The twist, here, is that you probably 
couldn't even get two bagels for this price at your local coffee shop! These, and other great values, are only as 
far away as your local TJ's bakery aisle.

NOTE for the Crew: Our Pretzel Bagels arrive at the store bagged and frozen. They must be thawed before they are ready to 
sell on the shelves.

"053835","Organic French Baguette","Following World War I, French workers rebelled against the upper crust for low wages and poor working condi-
tions. By the early 1920s, the workers' strikes had won important reforms, including strict limitations on long 
and grueling work hours. 

Under the new laws, French bakeries were forbidden to operate between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Un-
fortunately, well-rested bakers also meant that traditional French boules (round loaves) would not have enough 
time to bake before breakfast. Some historians suspect that this turn of events gave rise to the popularity of the 
baguette-a long, thin loaf with a shorter baking time-a shoo-in for the new breakfast-bread favorite among 
the French. 

Today, baguettes are a favorite nearly everywhere, all the time. At Trader Joe's, our conventional baguette has 
always been the best-selling item in our artisan sections. Now, we have the opportunity to offer a version made 
with organic, unbleached flour at a highly competitive price. Each 11.5-ounce Organic French Baguette is an 
amazing $1.99.

While that's a price that post-War French workers could never afford, the average 21st century American should 
have no problem. At Trader Joe's, value is not only 'in the bag'¿ it's in the Bag-uette!

"035784","Madeleine Cookies","There is plenty of folklore and legend associated with the madeleine. Some say that these soft, cake-like cookie 
were first baked in Lorraine, France and named after a central character in the region's history. Others allege 
that they were named after the French woman who first discovered them on a pilgrimage to Compostela, 
Spain. Regardless of where they came from, we know this much is true: the popularity of the classic madeleine 
endures. And as soon as you sink your teeth into a Trader Joe's Madeleine Cookie, you'll understand why.

Trader Joe's Madeleine Cookies are made for us by a Northern California bakery that has specialized in baking 
madeleines for over 40 years, using just four ingredients-sugar, butter, eggs, and natural flavors. Per tradition, 
our Madeleines are soft, moist, buttery, and cake-like. Also per tradition, they're baked in scalloped molds, 
giving them that distinctive, fancy shell shape that makes a Madeleine and Madeleine. 

Enjoy a Trader Joe's Madeleine Cookie or two anytime you're craving a bit of sweetness. They pair beautifully 
with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and they also compliment a strong cup of TJ's Earl Grey de la Creme Tea [sku

their classic, non-gluten-free counterparts. In fact, we specifically chose this bun to appeal to non-gluten-free 
customers just as much as the gluten-free crowd, because when it comes to burgers, you shouldn't have to 
compromise.

We recommend lightly warming these buns in a toaster or on the grills, then loading up with a fresh patty

Each two-or-three-bite-sized piece features a thick layer of moist, vanilla cake topped by an even thicker layer 
of luscious, orange- or lemon-flavored mousse, and finally enrobed in sweet, orange or yellow confectionary 
coating (hues courtesy of turmeric and paprika, rather than artificial dyes), and finally hand-decorated with a 
little green stem to look just like an orange, or a lemon. The end result creates a charming fruit basket effect on a

Naan is a traditional East Indian flat bread-typically baked in a Tandoor oven-that's as versatile as it is 
delicious, and Trader Joe's Tandoori Garlic Naan boasts manifold merits. Originally only available to stores 
served by our Daytona warehouse, this version is so superior that we decided to bring it in to stores served by 
our Irving and Minooka warehouses, too. It gets its satisfyingly dense doughy-ness from unbleached wheat

"064435","Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan","Let's take a moment to focus on Focaccia - which, as it turns out, is a pretty etymologically appropriate thing 
to do! The Italian word focaccia is derived from the original Latin word focus, which referred to the central 
hearth of a home, where the majority of a family's cooking was done. Indeed, by definition, focaccia (or panis 
focacius, as the Romans called it) was associated with the warmth and comfort of home from the very start. In 
that same tradition, we're setting our focus on the warmth and comfort of this soft, savory bread with Trader 
Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan.

Harkening back to its Ancient Roman roots, Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread is baked on a heated tile inside of 
a blazing hot, stone hearth oven. These conditions allow the bread to form the crisp, light crust and soft, airy 
crumb texture that focaccia is famous for. Our supplier also upholds an equally important (and delicious) 
tradition by topping each loaf with extra virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs, flavorful roasted tomatoes, and a 
generous dusting of finely-grated Parmesan cheese. Put together, each bite is a marvelous mix of iconic Italian 
flavors, perfect for serving alongside pasta, dipping into a mixture of olive oil and Balsamic Vinegar of Modena 
[sku 12800], or slicing and lightly toasting for use in sandwiches.

Now that we've focused on Focaccia, let's take a moment to focus on value - we're selling each 14-ounce 
loaf of Trader Joe's Focaccia Bread with Roasted Tomato & Parmesan for $3.99. You'll find them in our

"062023","Chocolate Chip Pain Au Lait","At Trader Joe's, we fancy ourselves ""traders on the culinary seas."" What does that mean, exactly? Well, for starters 
it means that our Buyers really do travel the world in search of products that excite, delight, and inspire. (Yes, it's a 
great gig.) Sometimes, they set sail with a particular product in mind; other times, they head out in search of sheer 
inspiration. 

Here, it was a bit of both-while our Buyer didn't head to France this time to specifically develop a private label 
Chocolate Chip Pain Au Lait, she had been inspired on previous visits to find a vendor to produce an authentic Pain 
Au Lait worthy of our bakery racks. ""Worthy"" is the key word here, though, and we were pleased as pain to introduce 
our plain Pain Au Lait [sku 60336] last fall. Now, with the help of that same French supplier and their time-honored 
family recipe, we're here to sweeten the deal, with Trader Joe's Chocolate Chip Pain Au Lait. It's that same heavenly 
Trader Joe's Pain Au Lait, but with rich, dark chocolate chips throughout.

Pain Au Lait translates directly to ""Milk Bread,"" a humble name for these slightly sweet, elegant, brioche-like rolls. 
Moist, eggy, sweet, and straightforward, they pair beautifully with butter and jam-we recommend TJ's French 
Cultured Butter [sku 53720] and TJ's Raspberry Preserves [sku 87805]-and are perfect for dunking in coffee, tea, or 
hot chocolate. They make a lovely breakfast (pain au chocolat is the breakfast of choice for many French children), a 
sweetly satisfying snack, or a decadent dessert. (Try warming and enjoying alongside a scoop of TJ's Organic Vanilla 
Fudge Chip Ice Cream [sku 56415]-you won't regret it!) But, heck, for $2.99 per 9.9-ounce bag (8 rolls per bag), you 
can afford to add a Pain Au Lait to each and every meal...

No need to travel to Paris for this Pain-you'll find this typically-only-available-in-specialty-bakeries Chocolate Chip 
Pain Au Lait in the bakery section at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"064741","Blueberry Muffins","Nothing quite says ""good morning!"" like a muffin. We're, of course, speaking figuratively here, if you come 
across a muffin that actually talks, that's out of our wheelhouse. But the point stands: there's just something 
about waking up to a satisfying muffin on your plate that makes a morning feel special, and makes you feel 
ready to take on the day. That's precisely the feeling we intend to invoke with Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins, a 
four-pack of light, cakey muffins, each filled with a bountful bunch of blueberries and topped with a sprinkling 
of crunchy sugar. 

Blueberry muffins are a true classic of the muffin category, and Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins play to every one 
of the genre's strengths: a crumbly, cakey texture, delightful hints of lemon zest, and, of course, an abundance 
of wild and cultivated blueberries in each bite. While they're perfectly delicious when enjoyed as a quick, on-
the-go breakfast snack or brunch side, we contend that they truly excel when heated up a bit in the toaster oven 
or microwave - the aromatics of warm blueberries alone are well worth the price of admission. After that,  
we recommend a generous application of butter, a drizzling of honey, or a sizeable spreading of Trader Joe's 
Authentic Lemon Curd [sku 07850].

Just as nothing says ""good morning!"" like a sweet, fruit-filled muffin at the start of your day, nothing quite 
says ""Trader Joe's"" like a great value at the end of your shopping trip. That's why we're selling each 14-ounce 
container of Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffins for $3.99, every day (and morning, we might add). You'll find 
them in our bakery section.

"063707","Sprouted Wheat Sourdough Bread","Bread. Even though modern diet culture tells us to fear it, bread is a scrumptiously inevitable household staple. 
And why shouldn't it be? It's delicious, filling, and in many cases, quite nutritious. If you're a fan of all things 
delicious, filling, and nutritious, you might want to head to your local Trader Joe's, because we've got a bread 
you won't want to miss: Trader Joe's Sprouted Wheat Sourdough Bread.

Our baker begins with organic sprouted wheat berries and a sourdough starter from Northern California. 
You know how folks say Bay Area sourdough tastes different (even better?) than sourdough from anywhere 
else?  That's the tangy sourdough flavor you'll enjoy in every slice of this Sprouted Wheat Sourdough Bread. 
Because this loaf is made with organic sprouted wheat berries (sprouted at the bakery, by the way), as well as 
both wheat and rye flours, its flavor is more robust, more complex than an ordinary sourdough. We think this 
makes it even more delicious, whether used for toast at breakfast time (a slather of good butter never hurt) or 
sandwiches at lunch or dinner (we suggest a grilled cheese here). 

Sprouted Wheat Sourdough delivers seven grams of protein in each 90-calorie slice. We're selling each 24 
ounce, kosher-certified loaf for $3.99, every day. You'll find it on our bread racks.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20101/63707.png","4.49","[""Cut The Mustard""]","[""Kosher"",""Organic""]","[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1 slice (34g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""90 ""}]"
"063475","Everything Ciabatta Rolls","""By trying to understand everything, everything makes me dream."" -Gustave Flaubert

Admittedly, Flaubert wasn't talking about Trader Joe's Everything Ciabatta Rolls. But he could have been, 
because, similarly, by trying to understand Everything Ciabatta Rolls, Everything Ciabatta Rolls make you 
dream...of more Everything Ciabatta Rolls.

Made for us by a kosher-certified bakery that specializes in artisan-style breads, TJ's Everything Ciabatta 
Rolls offer everything you could hope for in a classic Ciabatta-a tender & toothsome crumb, a moist interior 
with small air pockets throughout, a substantial crust, etc.-in convenient ""Roll"" form. Best of all, each Roll is 
generously topped with an ""Everything"" seasoning blend of sea salt, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried minced 
garlic, & dried minced onion. Now, if that doesn't make you dream...well, then we don't know what would.

Reheat these Rolls directly on the oven rack at 400°F for 3-4 minutes and serve warm at dinnertime, alongside 
TJ's Cultured Butter [sku 53720]. Slice one in half and use it as a base for a Caprese sandwich made with sliced 
TJ's Beefsteak Tomatoes [93723], medallions of TJ's Pre-Sliced Mozzarella [sku 61445], leaves of TJ's Organic 
Basil [sku 97197], and a drizzle of TJ's Organic Balsamic & Fig Dressing [sku 63281].

"060336","Pain Au Lait","At Trader Joe's, we fancy ourselves ""traders on the culinary seas."" What does that mean, exactly? Well, for starters 
it means that our Buyers really do travel the world in search of products that excite, delight, and inspire. (Yes, it 
is a great gig.) Sometimes, they set sail with a particular product in mind; other times, they head out in search 
of sheer inspiration. 

Here, it was a bit of both-while our lead Product Innovator didn't head to France this time to specifically 
develop a private label Pain Au Lait, she had been inspired on previous visits to find a vendor to produce an 
authentic version worthy of our bakery racks. ""Worthy"" is the key word here, though, and we are pleased to 
announce that her bready vision has finally met its match! Introducing Trader Joe's Pain Au Lait, made for us 
in France from a traditional family recipe.

Pain Au Lait translates directly to ""Milk Bread,"" a humble name for these slightly sweet, elegant, brioche-like 
rolls. Moist, eggy, and straightforward, they pair beautifully with butter and jam (we recommend TJ's French 
Cultured Butter [sku 53720] and TJ's Raspberry Preserves [sku 87805]) and are perfect for dunking in coffee, tea, 
or hot chocolate. They also make a great dinner roll, a tasty afternoon snack, or a nice base for a TJ's Pulled Pork 
[sku 93602] slider lunch. Heck, at $2.99 for a 9.9-ounce bag (8 rolls per bag), you can afford to add a Pain Au 
Lait to each and every meal if you so choose. 

No need to travel to Paris for this Pain-you'll find this typically-only-available-in-specialty-bakeries Pain Au 
Lait in the bakery section at your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"014626","Classic English Muffins","Don't order an English Muffin in England, as you will likely get a funny look:  Like the ""French"" in ""French 
fries,"" the ""English"" in ""English muffin"" is just an American moniker, mostly assigned to distinguish the bearer 
of said moniker from traditional, American-style muffins. (You know, the kind that come sitting in little paper 
wrappers¿and are often quite sweet.)

Trader Joe's English Muffins are not sweet muffins-if anything, they're a bit savory. Technically speaking, 
they're slightly spongy (picture a sourdough-like texture), puck-shaped pieces of bread, horizontally bisected 
into two, equal, circular halves. Each Muffin has a toothsome exterior (more of a ""skin"" than a ""crust,"" though), 
and an interior filled with plenty of¿well, least we infringe upon on any trademarks, we'll say they're filled with 
plenty of ""pockets & crevices."" Yes, that's it. Pockets & crevices¿

Point is, our new, kaizen-ed English Muffins are hearty and delicious-perfect for toasting and slathering with 
butter, cream cheese, peanut butter, etc. or for using as the base of a breakfast sandwich. You'll find 12-ounce 
packages of six Trader Joe's English Muffins in our bakery section, available for $1.79 each, everyday.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20102/14626.png","1.99","[""Rise & Shine""]","[""Kosher""]","[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1 muffin (57g)"",""calories_per_serving"":""130 ""}]"
"060680","Organic French Rolls","We're on a mission to bring even more exciting, delicious, artisanal selections to our Bakery section, and with 
our latest addition, you might just say¿we're on a roll. Indeed, Trader Joe's Organic French Rolls are a breath 
of freshly-baked air for our day breads, offering the same time-honored flavor, texture (and even recipe) of a 
classic baguette, portioned into six delicious Rolls. And on top of all that, they're entirely organic. 

Each bag of Organic French Rolls contains six soft, crusty, artisan-style Rolls, ready to be served at the dinner 
table (or anywhere else where baguettes are called for) immediately. We would be remiss, however, if we didn't 
suggest giving them an extra flavor boost by lightly toasting them in an oven at 400°F for three to four minutes 
just prior to eating. Each French Roll is perfectly sized for making mini-sandwiches and sliders, be it with 
your favorite deli meats and fixings, burger-based accoutrements, or, our personal favorite, leftovers from the 
night before.

Please join us in welcoming Trader Joe's Organic French Rolls to our already-illustrious collection of artisan-
style breads. While other retailers may charge a premium on organic breads of this quality, at Trader Joe's, 
you'll find each 10.5-ounce bag for $2.29, every day. Let the good times roll!

"058641","Sweet Pull Apart Aloha Rolls","If you visit Hawaii, locals will tell you that there is more to the term ""aloha"" than a simple hello or goodbye. 
Aloha refers to an overflowing spirit of love-a way of life, if you will. Similarly, if you visit Trader Joe's, Crew 
Members will tell you that there is more to our Sweet Pull-Apart Aloha Rolls than a simple mixture of flour, 
sugar, water, and yeast. Calling these Rolls ""a way of life"" might be a stretch-but calling them special, delicious, 
and/or inspired seems wholly appropriate. 

Trader Joe's Sweet Pull-Apart Aloha Rolls are light, fluffy, and perfect for sopping up all the leftover gravy 
goodness on your Thanksgiving plate. They're also ideal for party sandwiches and sliders-just pull them apart 
(they come ""attached"" in a 3-roll by 4-roll rectangle), split them in half and pile on your filling of choice. 
Heck, we've even used these Rolls as sweet-but-not-too-sweet ice cream sandwich ""buns."" Let your bread basket 
overflow! You can't go wrong when you invite the spirit of aloha to the table. 

You also can't go wrong with our price-we're selling each 12-ounce package of a dozen, delicious Aloha Rolls 
for $2.99. You'll find them in our bakery section.
