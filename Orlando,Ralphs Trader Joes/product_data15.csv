reminiscent of a citrusy sangria, are combined with bubbly, sparkling water to create a delicately fruity, fizzy 
drink. When you take a sip, you'll experience a clean, crisp flavor, thanks to the absence of sugar, artificial 
sweeteners, and sodium. 

These cans of Sparkling Water are ideal for on-the-go hydration-pack them in a lunch bag or hand them out 
as you deck the halls. Create a fancy mocktail at home by pouring in a glass, over ice, embellished with fruit. 
Or add to your favorite wine-based cocktail to make a spritz!

"076006","Coconut Water","The quality of any coconut beverage is entirely dependent upon the quality of the coconut. Fortunately for folks 
who go nuts for the stuff (as many of you do), Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from only the finest 
of coconuts, grown on coconut farms in Brazil where the reliably warm climate lends itself to a year-round 
harvest. The coconuts are plucked and drained of their water, then the water-i.e., the Coconut Water-is 
pasteurized and blended with a bit of vitamin C to help maintain its natural color.

The whole thing is a simple process, really-so when you pluck a carton of Trader Joe's Coconut Water from 
our shelves and crack it open, it's easy to picture yourself sipping the stuff straight from the source. Its potassium 
content (about 980mg, or 20% of the recommended daily value, per carton) and convenient, grab-and-go-
format make it an excellent option for post-workout rehydration. It also adds some subtle, coconutty flavor 
to smoothies and mixed drinks. And here's a #ProTip: no matter how you choose to enjoy it, we recommend 
chilling our shelf-stable-until-open Coconut Water in the fridge and shaking it well before serving. Cheers!

"097911","Coconut Water, 1L","Wild coconuts (which are not really ""nuts,"" but drupes or ""stone fruit"") have three distinct, physical layers. 
However, when you pick up a coconut in most stores, you're probably just looking at the hard, brown, inner 
layer (the ""pit,"" if you will) called the endocarp. When coconuts are young and green, their endocarp is filled 
with endosperm, which consists of white flesh and a watery liquid that serves as nutrition for the growing 
coconut seed. In the language of alternative beverages, we call this liquid, ""coconut water.""

Trader Joe's Coconut Water is extracted from coconuts that are grown on a massive coconut plantation in 
Brazil. Our supplier is situated in a region of Latin America where the climate is ideal for growing coconuts-
and this means they get to harvest them year-round. Within a few days of being plucked, the coconuts are 
drained of their ""water,"" which is then pasteurized and packaged with less than 1% fructose and ascorbic acid. 
Fructose is a natural fruit sugar already in coconut. Adding a little more helps balance the brix count (and 
therefore the flavor), which can vary seasonally. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) helps to maintain the water's original 
color. So... when you pluck this shelf-stable box from our grocery shelves and crack it open, you'll discover 99% 
juice, with a refreshing and authentic taste!

Chill it and shake it well before enjoying a glass, straight up. You might also try blending it into homemade 
soups, or fruit smoothies when you want to add real, coconut flavor. Each 33.8 fluid ounce (one liter) Tetra Pak® 
of Trader Joe's Coconut Water is a value at $2.99. Find it in our grocery section, along with our other shelf-
stable beverages.

"165408","Blueberry Lemonade Sparkling Water","Flavored Sparkling Waters have truly popped off in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. These ebulliently 
bright & bubbly beverages are an easy antidote to a hot summer's day, and with their subtle, fruity flavors that don't 
overpower (or over-sweeten) the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the everyday act of hydration. 
So whenever we choose to venture into business of fizziness, we do so with great care.To reach a new caliber of 
carbonation, all varieties of our Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural Flavors eschew sweeteneers and 
artificual flavor agents. Instead, we use three simple ingredients: water, CO2, and-you guessed it-natural flavors. 

For our latest seasonal sparkler, those natural flavors are a blend of naturally sweet Blueberry flavor & tart, tangy 
Lemonade flavor-a combination that really sets the new standard for seasonal effervescent excellence. Each can 
of Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural Blueberry Lemonade Flavor contains zero calories, zero grams 
of sugar, and zero miligrams of sodium, so while you'll love it chilled & served on its own (it's the perfect non-
alcoholic BBQ or day-at-the-beach beverage), you can also afford to mix it with a splash of spirits. Or, better yet, 
with a scoop of TJ's Premium Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576] for a summery ice cream soda. 

Join the carbonated craze with our elevated, crisp, & refreshing Trader Joe's Sparkling Water with Natural 
Blueberry Lemonade Flavor today! We're selling eight-packs of 12-fluid ounce cans for $3.29-a value that's 
sure to make a splash!

"168472","Watermelon Lemonade Sparkling Water","We find that one of the quickest (and certainly one of the most cost effective) ways to add some sparkle to 
your life is to add some sparkle to your water. A bit of bright and breezy bubbly water can make the difference 
between ho-hum hydration and resplendent refreshment, especially when combined with some light fruit 
flavorings. And if you can contain that carbonation in a conveniently conveyable can? That's the dream. That's 
why, this summer, we're bringing in cans of Trader Joe's Watermelon Lemonade Sparkling Water in  party 
(or picnic)-sized eight-packs. Sparkling water fans, rejoice!

Combining the lush fruitiness of watermelon with the satisfying sweet-tartness of a summertime lemonade, this 
exhilaratingly effervescent Sparkling Water is one of the tastiest ways to cool off you'll find all summer long. 
Best served nice and cold, you can enjoy it on the go, while on an afternoon walk around the neighborhood, 
or while lazing in a hammock. You can also have it slightly dressed up at home, over ice with a garnish of 
lemon peel, a spring of rosemary or mint, or even a splash of your favorite liquor for a quick cocktail. For 
the remainder of the summer, you can find 8-packs of 12-fl. oz cans of Trader Joe's Watermelon Lemonade 
Sparkling Water at your neighborhood Trader Joe's - look for them with our other sparkling waters, while 
supplies last.

"065256","Single Origin Organic Coconut Water","What, exactly, is it about Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Water that makes it so remarkably refreshing? The 
answer, as it turns out, is hidden in the question. Within hours of harvesting the coconuts-which, by the way, 
all happen to be of the Namhom variety, grown in Thailand's Ratchaburi Province-our supplier pasteurizes the 
coconut water using a high temperature, short duration method that ensures a safe product, while still retaining 
the vibrancy of the coconut flavor. Then it's bottled, sealed, and kept cold all the way to your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's store, so... What makes this Coconut Water so remarkably refreshing? Keeping it fresh!

With its crisp, slightly sweet profile, rejuvenating hydration potential, and delightful pink-ish hue (a natural 
product of enzymes that are particularly present in Namhom coconuts), Trader Joe's Organic Coconut Water 
ranks among the freshest of our Fresh Beverages. And among other coconut waters, it ranks remarkably high 
in value: each 10 fl. ounce bottle selles for $1.99*, every day.

"162206","Seltzer Water flavored with Lemon and Ginger Juice","Flavored seltzers have truly popped off recently, and it's not hard to see why. These bright and bubbly bever-
ages are an easy antidote to a hot summer's day, and with their subtle, fruity flavors that don't overpower (or 
over-sweeten) the palate, they're just the thing to add some sparkle to the everyday act of hydration. So when 
the time came for us to get into the business of fizziness, we knew we couldn't just do with any ordinary seltzer. 
No, to reach a new caliber of carbonation, we eschewed flavor agents and sweeteners and used real, organic fruit 
juices to create Trader Joe's Seltzers With A Splash, the new standard for effervescent excellence. 

Made with only three simple ingredients (carbonated water, organic lemon juice, and organic ginger juice), Selt-
zers With A Splash Of Lemon and Ginger Juice harmoniously combines the refreshing fizz of a seltzer water 
with the lightly sweet taste of lemon juice and unmistakeable flavor of ginger. The blend of ginger and lemon 
creates a delightfully aromatic, but never overpowering, drinking experience that's truly invigorating. Striking 
a sensational balance between fullness of flavor and easy-going drinkability, it makes for a great companion for 
mid-morning hikes or outdoor summer concerts.

No doubt, one of the best aspects of flavored seltzer is its anytime versatility. Thirsty after a long day of work? 
Make like the hip kids and crack open a can, right out of the refrigerator. Need a non-alcoholic, but still-fancy-
feeling drink to serve at a gathering? You're all set with this snappy lemon-ginger spritzer. A-OK with alcohol? 
Try adding a bit of TJ's Art of the Still Organic Vodka [sku 57854] for a quick-and-easy all-organic cocktail.
