"051341","Grand Reserve Chardonnay Carneros 2023","Our TJ Grand Reserve label is ""reserved"" for special wines we feel are unique values and truly represent 
the qualities of their appellation. This Carneros Chardonnay comes from a terrific winery in Sonoma 
County and they specialize in Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. This is our second vintage and we think it 
easily matches the quality of the 2015 vintage. This wine more than meets our expectation of a great 
Carneros Chardonnay.  It is an unbeatable deal!!  The Lot# 20 is the same lot number that we used for 
the 2015, thereby letting our customers and crew know that the source and winemaking team are exactly 
the same; only the vintage has changed. 

 
Oak Barrel Fermentation: 
Inspired by its pioneering roots in 1969, this little-known corner straddling Sonoma and Napa's southern 
boundaries is known as Carneros. The grapes included in this Carneros Chardonnay were hand harvested 
from four different vineyards in the Carneros region including Sangacimo Vineyard, Herman Vineyards, 
Wildcat Mountain, and Thornton Vineyard. The wine was aged in French and Hungarian oak barrels 
(25% new French oak) for 12 months before bottled unfiltered.  A beautiful honey color in the glass, this 
Carneros Chardonnay offers delicate aromas of Fuji apple, marzipan, and peach blossom. Layered flavors 
of Asian pear, lemon curd, and baked peaches are complimented by notes of vanilla oak and soft spice. 
Medium bodied, this wine coats the palate but is balanced with bright acidity on the finish.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/51341.png","12.99","[""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Effortless Entertaining"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"079525","Espresso Martini","When covering all your bases for a dinner party, holiday feast, or really any kind of get-together where great 
food is involved, don't forget to pick up something special and spirited as an after-dinner treat-something like 
Trader Joe's Espresso Martini. Modeled after the cocktail craze that's been sweeping bar menus these past few 
years, this pre-mixed and totally ready-to-drink Espresso Martini is made with a base of vodka, espresso, and 
a touch of vanilla so that every sip is rich, sweet, and strikingly smooth-ideal for serving alongside something 
chocolatey and decadent. 

Of course, that's just one of many situations in which a pre-made Martini might make the evening that much 
more elegant. It's excellent for keeping in the fridge as an instant way to elevate a Friday evening. It makes an 
alluring accompaniment to cheese boards and hors d'oeuvres platters. And, since each bottle contains roughly 
four servings, it's a bit like an instant-cocktail-party-in-a-bottle for you and three friends, and all for a price 
that's less than what you'd pay for a single espresso martini at most cocktail bars! Now, isn't that sweet? That's 
that Trader Joe's Espresso Martini!

Susumaniello originated. It's jam-packed with fruity goodness and is a wonderful showcase of the 
quality wine coming out of the region. The price we're able to offer is certainly a value and as this is an 
everyday wine, customers are safe to put it on their shopping list every week! The grape name 
""Susumaniello"" is derived from somarello, meaning ""donkey"", presumably because just like the donkeys 
once used for transporting the grape harvest - this high-yielding variety is capable of bearing 
remarkably heavy loads. 

Puglian wine is the product of a diverse landscape. The warm climate and fertile soil make it easy to 
grow almost anything. Puglia is surrounded by water on three sides allowing cool breezes off the 
Mediterranean to moderate vineyard temperatures. The grapes for this Susumaniello were hand- 
harvested and processed with a low-frequency stemmer, maceration and fermentation. The wine is then 
matured in steel, as well as wood barrels.

familiar, fall-festive notes of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon.

Possessing an ABV of 6.9%, this Pumpkin Spice Chardonnay is the epitome of lounge-worthy. Just imagine 
enjoying a chilled glass of Pumpkin Spice Chardonnay on a brisk, blustery, autumn evening, alongside a slice

"078993","Langhe Nebbiolo Rosa dell Olmo 2021","The Langhe hills of northwest Italy's Piedmont region are home to some of the most prestigious and 

long-lived wines produced from the noble Nebbiolo grape. This particular bottling hails from the Langhe 

DOC, a broad regional designation that includes the area south of Alba and encompasses the most prestigious 

appellations of Piedmont (Barolo, Barbaresco), where the grape is regaled for its ability to translate the area's 

unique terroir into profoundly aromatic and structured wines.  

Swirling allows the captivating perfume to unfurl - revealing beguiling aromas of ripe cherry, dried 

roses, fresh tar, licorice, truffles and autumnal woodland notes. On the palate, the texture is simultaneously 

broad and chiseled with sturdy but fine-grained tannins carrying impressions of rich red and dark fruits, spice 

and lingering minerality across a juicy, mouth-watering finish that goes on and on. While still somewhat 

youthful after a few years, this Nebbiolo Langhe DOC is enjoyable now and will also reward those with the 

patience to cellar it for a few years further.   

The wine's boldly structured and savory character calls for heartier fare to allow its complexity to 

fully shine. Perfectly matched with rich dishes featuring wild game, cured meats or aged cheeses, this 

Nebbiolo would be sublime paired with venison stew with juniper berries, wild boar ragu tossed with 

pappardelle, or a board of Toma Piemontese and Bra Duro with shaved truffles. For vegetarians, roasted 

portobello mushrooms with rosemary or baked pasta al forno with caramelized onions would stand up nicely. 

No matter the pairing, this bottling promises an intellectually stimulating and memorable experience with 

each sip.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/78993.png","8.99","[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Glass Half Full""]",,

for numerous lots of prime juice. For this Caretaker Pinot Noir, we sourced from the family's vineyard 
holdings in Santa Maria Valley and worked with them to craft a well-balanced wine with a smooth finish. 
 

Winemakers Notes: 
As you swirl your glass and let these aromas tantalize your senses you'll be drawn in by notes of 
strawberries, fresh forest floor, mushroom and toasted oak. Once you partake of this enchanting ruby red 
Pinot Noir your palate will delight with bright red fruits and slight cedar notes. 
 
The Santa Maria Valley AVA is in the northern part of the Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties 
and the valley is funnel-shaped opening up to the Pacific Ocean. This region does not get a lot of rainfall 
and has a long growing season, which allows the grapes to develop big flavors. In addition, the sea fog 
has a tendency to roll into the valley and last until mid-day creating some wide temperature differentials, 
particularly in the warmer months.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/99318.png","9.99","[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Glass Half Full""]",,

iconic status. Our Speculoos Cookie Butter [sku 96761] certainly fits that bill. The moment this superlatively 
soft, sweet spread hit our grocery shelves, our customers couldn't get enough. We heard tell of folks mixing 
it into brownie batter, blending it in coffee drinks, drizzling it over a sundae¿ This got us thinking: if cookie 
butter goes well with all those desserts, we bet it would taste great as a dessert beer, too. Lo and behold, that bet

It's made in collaboration with one of our favorite craft breweries  (and an award-winning producer of delicious 
dessert beers), Hardywood Park. For this impressive imperial golden ale, they use vanilla beans, milk sugar, and 
toasted coconut to evoke the sweet, caramel-y flavor of Cookie Butter in every rich, flavorful sip. It's excellent 
as both an after-dinner indulgence, and when enjoyed on a long, lazy, late-summer weekend afternoon; we're

Wine makers across the state concluded that 2020, though marked with challenges, actually produced smaller

"079632","Grand Reserve Syrah Sonoma County 2022","Ah, Syrah. This fabulously full-bodied, dependably delicious grape forms the backbone of many a rich red 
wine, due in large part to its remarkable adaptability: Syrahs from warmer environs tend to be bigger and 
bolder, while those grown in more moderate conditions are almost always softer and gentler. Carefully crafted 
with grapes in California's Sonoma County, Trader Joe's Grand Reserve Syrah Lot 133 is a bit of both, thanks 
to Sonoma's bright, sunny days and long, cool nights. With its medium-to-full body, fine tannins, and juicy, 
peppery profile, it might just be the ideal red wine for the end of summer.

Area), our latest Trader Joe's Reserve Chardonnay is the very definition of a fine wine. After the grapes are 
picked, crushed, and macerated, the juice is aged in both new oak and once-used French oak barrels for eight 
months. In your glass, this Chardonnay opens with enticing aromas of ripe pear and honeydew, leading to a 
palate that unveils an ideal balance between crisp green apple and hints of toasted vanilla. Refreshing acidity 
and subtle oak nuances culminate in a creamy, lingering finish that is ultimately a delightful expression of 
Yountville's esteemed terroir.

Creamy chicken dishes are a classic pairing with Chardonnay, and our Organic Boneless Skinless Chicken 
Breasts [sku 63550] lend themselves beautifully to Poulet à la Crème or Chicken Fricassée-if you're in the 
cheffing mood. Go lighter (both calorie & work-wise) with either a ready-to-eat Caesar Salad with Salmon

As a pre-meal Apertivo, Pronto! can be enjoyed entirely on its own, served neat or on the rocks, though we find 
that a squeeze of lemon or orange helps bring the best out of its herbaceous attributes. As a cocktail ingredient, 
it's an essential element of a Negroni, Paper Plane, or Black Manhattan, and makes a superb substitute for 
vermouth for those looking to try a new take on their old favorites. And, of course, if you've got your sights on

over 10 acres. They provide unique natural conditions that are ideal for the production of Crémant: a 

naturally cool temperature at a constant 52 F, ideal maturing and ageing, a naturally high level of moisture 

(about 80% humidity in the heart of the winery), soft diffused light that helps preserve the flavor and the 

color of fine wines. 

La Burgondie Crémant de Bourgogne is made using exactly the same methods employed in the making of 

Champagne - the Méthode Traditionelle. It is a blend of premium Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Gamay and 

Aligotè grapes, and exhibits solid structure, mildly fruity flavor and fine bubbles. Because Burgundy's 

sparkling wines are not as well-known as those from Champagne, they tend to cost considerably less. But 

don't be deceived by the price. Crémant de Bourgogne is every bit as good - or better - than wines carrying 

the Champagne moniker - just less pricey. We're selling La Burgondie, Crémant de Bourgogne for the 

unbelievably low price of $10.99 for a 750 ml bottle. Heck, that's cause for celebration right there!","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/58288.png","10.99","[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Date Night"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"078466","Trading Post Cabernet Sauvignon of Napa Valley 2022","Ever since we started carrying wines-lo, those many decades ago-we've made it our mission to ensure that 
every time you make the trek to your neighborhood Trader Joe's wine shop, you'll find something wonderful. 
Whether it's an everyday gem or one of our limited-quantity Trader Joe's Reserve wines, there's always 
something reliably fantastic to try-and for an unimpeachably excellent value, too. Now, we're continuing that 
mission with the introduction of Trading Post by Trader Joe's. Made exclusively for us by a trusted winery 
partner in the heart of Napa Valley, you can think of the Trading Post label as the best of both worlds among 
our wine selection, combining the same outstanding quality and value of our limited-run Reserve wines with 
the consistent availability of our everyday favorites.

For the Trading Post's inaugural outing, we're offering a characteristically robust and elegant Napa Valley 
Cabernet Sauvignon. With rich and alluring aromatics of black cherry, vanilla, and tobacco, and a complex 
profile of ripe fruit, baking spice, and toasty oak, it's precisely the kind of jammy Cab that made Napa famous. 
Bold, yet easy-drinking, with a long, languid, satisfying finish, it serves just as well paired with a seared steak or 
hearty stew as it does completely on its own, enjoyed with a book, movie, or good company.

"084791","Vintage Spiced Ale 2023","Beer is usually thought of as a ""drink now"" kind of beverage, as in: ""Hey, when you're at Trader Joe's, pick us up 
a six-pack to drink while we watch the game this afternoon!"" What if we offered a beer and suggested you wait a 
year before cracking it open? Trader Joe's Vintage Ale is that beer. Brewed and bottled in limited quantities just 
for us during the holidays, it becomes more complex and interesting as time goes by-making this ""drink later"" 
proposition an interesting one, indeed.

Our strong, dark, Belgian-style ale has an additional bit of fresh yeast added to it just before bottling. This causes 
a second fermentation in the bottle, leaving behind ""lees"" (sediment) that add much to the flavor and mouthfeel 
of this Ale. And since it is not pasteurized, the original aromas and flavors (cocoa and malt, with notes of citrus, 
ginger, and baking spices) evolve through aging to gain even more complexity. (Tip: ideal storage conditions for 
graceful aging call for standing the bottle upright, in a cool, dark environment.)

Vintage Ale is equally at home when paired with roasted holiday meats and mashed potatoes, or a slice of Sweet 
Potato Pie with Maple Bourbon Flavor [sku 57666]. Choose to drink it now and you'll definitely be pleased. Or, 
you can let it mature while you enjoy last year's 2015 Vintage Ale. What's that? You say you didn't buy one last 
year? We can't let that happen again (see reference to ""limited quantities"" above). Our 2016 Vintage Ale in a 750

than we expected. So last year, we ordered more, so we wouldn't run out quite so quickly. This year, we've 
decided to go a step further, and in addition to that proven punch-replacement, we're introducing Trader 
Joe's Cocoa Cream Liqueur. Conceptually similar to its Egg Nog kin, this one is ostensibly a cup of cocoa, 
pre-spiked with alcohol, in a convenient 750mL bottle. You can serve it over ice, pour it over vanilla ice cream, 
add it to an after-dinner coffee, gild it with Peppermint Mini Marshmallows [sku 66459], or just sip it, straight.

We have limited quantities of Cocoa Cream Liqueur for the holiday season, so stock up while you can. We're 
selling each 750mL bottle for $7.99, while it lasts.

way back in 2017¿ and things just took off from there. That first year, it was our now-famous TJ's Egg Nog 
Liqueur that made a splash. Next, in 2018, we added TJ's Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur to the lineup. Then, in 
2019, TJ's Cocoa Cream Liqueur saw its grand debut, followed in 2020 by the advent of TJ's Gingerbread Cream 
Liqueur. This year, we're expanding the selection even further, inspired by Trader Joe's own TJ's Candy Cane 
Joe-Joe's Chocolate Crème Sandwich Cookies: Trader Joe's Peppermint Joe-Joe's Cream Liqueur.
 
Our Peppermint Joe-Joe's Cream Liqueur begins with a neutral grain spirit, to which we add cream, sugar, 
peppermint extract, and a hint of natural cocoa flavor to mimic the mint-cookies-'n-cream flavor of the cookies 
from which this Liqueur takes its name. Like its forebears, it's delicious on its own, warmed or over ice. It also 
makes a mighty tasty, spiked peppermint latte-just add it to hot or iced coffee, sit back, and sip away the cares 
of the day. We've also heard rumors that this one really shines when poured over vanilla ice cream-or blended 
with vanilla ice cream for a dreamy ""adult"" milkshake. (Add some crushed TJ's Candy Cane Joe-Joe's to that 
shake if you really want to be WOW-ed¿) You'll find it in 750mL bottles at Trader Joe's stores where spirits are

sweet, mulled wine that has been keeping spirits bright for more than 600 years. Our supplier in Germany

cloves, nutmeg, and the zest of orange and lemon. Here in the States, they call it Hark and Holly Glühwein. 
And at Trader Joe's, we call it one of our favorite ways to keep warm during the holidays.

Simply heat a few mugs' worth of Hark and Holly on the stovetop, then serve to your guests as an aperitif 
with appetizers (we find its rich, fruity spice is especially suited to cheese and crackers) or as a nightcap at the 
end of your wintry revels. Just be sure to pick your bottle up soon-we only carry Hark and Holly during the

"077191","Gran Reserva Maule Valley Chile 2020","One of the first areas in Chile to plant wine-growing grapes, the Maule Valley has since become the country's 
premier viticultural region for creating big, bold, and highly complex reds. Situated near the center of Chile's 
narrow span, just a little south of Santiago, the Valley is blessed with a relatively cool climate and remarkably 
fertile soils, both a product of the mighty Maule River's presence. Conditions like these help grapes develop 
juicy flavor profiles, strong, supportive tannins, and well-balanced levels of acidity-all of which are expressed 
most elegantly in Trader Joe's Gran Reserva Maule Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, Lot 121.

Each sip of this Gran Reserva Cab is rich, robust, and oaky (a result of being aged in French and American 
oak for a year and a half), with lightly peppery edges that tickle the corners of one's palate. It's a fascinating, 
well-concentrated profile that synergizes spectacularly well with the flavors of grilled meat, pan-fried sausage, 
or a roast Bacon Wrapped Porchetta [sku 55559]. And, of course, since we sell it in our label, it's also an extreme 
value. ¡Salud!

speaking, the multi-faceted flavor profile of Pinot Noir pairs well with traditional Thanksgiving fare. Our 
latest Grand Reserve Pinot Noir from Santa Lucia Highlands further promotes this Thanksgiving-Pinot 
Noir partnership.

This 2021 vintage was cultivated during a cooler growing season. The mild temperatures, overnight fog, and 
afternoon winds in Monterey County (where Santa Lucia Highlands AVA is located), brought forth fuller 
grape development, and preserved acid levels in the fruit. This yielded intense, multi-dimensional fruit flavors 
and textures in the wine. You'll experience notes of blueberry/boysenberry, nutmeg, rich cocoa, vanilla, and 
brown sugar on the nose. On the sip, flavors of sage, raspberry, rhubarb, and cherry emerge. Now think about 
your holiday menu: do you recognize any points of connection? Pick up a couple bottles of TJ's Grand 
Reserve Pinot Noir SLH; one to enjoy with your big holiday meal, and another to sip with the leftovers!

the story...

After being disappointed by other pumpkin ciders on the market-with their predominant apple flavor and 
spices verging on potpourri-we approached one of the breweries with whom we've partnered quite a bit 
to help us develop a superior version. Initial results were disappointing... until we added actual pumpkin

of fermented, not-from-concentrate apple juice from Oregon. (While we're on percentages, this Cider is 5%

The apple-cider excellence and authentic pumpkin flavor are brought together with hints of fall spices, and 
just the right amount of carbonation to make this light-bodied beverage crisp and refreshing. And now, we're

Coast craft brewer who marries modern-day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, that 
""marriage"" takes some inspiration from a real-life historical wedding! First celebrated in Munich in 1810, the 
inaugural Oktoberfest was thrown to mark the nuptials of Kronprinz Ludwig to Princess Therese of Saxe-
Hildburghausen. Now nearly synomous with beer, Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is an homage to the festival's 
official drink, known to locals as Märzenbier. In fact, in order to match Märzenbier's marvelously malty profile, 
the brewers at Josephsbrau have imported three kinds of malts all the way from Germany!

Each sip of Josephsbrau Oktoberfest is full-bodied and caramel-y, but with a light enough touch of hops that it 
remains remarkably easy-drinking. We recommend serving it well chilled, out of the can or in a frosty glass (or 
stein, if you've got one!), preferably alongside a grilled steak, sausage, or burger. We find that its toasty caramel 
malts are particularly suited to pairing with seared, and even slightly charred proteins-try a can the next time

"056083","Big Churn Chardonnay California","Big Churn Chardonnay offers a delightful expression of California's sun-kissed vineyards. This golden-hued wine 
greets the nose with aromas of ripe pear, crisp green apple, and subtle hints of vanilla. On the palate, it unfolds 
with layers of tropical fruit flavors, including pineapple and mango, balanced by a refreshing citrus acidity. The 
finish is long and creamy, with nuances of toasted oak and butter, characteristic of a well-crafted California 
Chardonnay. 
The grapes for Big Churn Chardonnay are sourced from select vineyards in California's Central Coast, where 
cool maritime breezes and foggy mornings create an ideal microclimate for Chardonnay cultivation. The region's 
diverse soils, ranging from sandy loam to limestone-rich terrains, impart a distinct minerality to the wine. This 
terroir influence, combined with careful viticulture and winemaking practices, results in a Chardonnay that 
beautifully captures the essence of its California origins. 
This versatile white wine pairs exceptionally well with a variety of cuisines. Its rich texture and balanced acidity 
make it an excellent companion to creamy pasta dishes, grilled seafood, and roasted poultry. For a classic pairing, 
serve it alongside butter-poached lobster or a creamy mushroom risotto. The wine's fruit-forward profile also 
complements lighter fare such as Caesar salad or fresh goat cheese. For a delightful appetizer pairing, try it with 
crab cakes or a selection of mild, soft cheeses.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/56083.png","6.99","[""Alfresco Dining"",""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full"",""Picnic""]",,
"068286","Old Fashioned","Not all of us are naturally-born mixologists. Nor do all of us have the time to break out the shaker when we're 
in the mood for a cocktail. Sometimes, when we're ready to drink, it's just great to have a ready-to-drink 
cocktail on hand. That's why we're introducing Trader Joe's Old Fashioned, a pre-mixed, precisely formulated, 
classic cocktail that's ready-to-drink, right out of the bottle. Now, whenever you need an old fashioned Old 
Fashioned, it's simply a matter of grabbing a glass-no measuring, shaking, or stirring required.

Trader Joe's Old Fashioned is made for us by a small, craft distiller, using the time-tested recipe of Bourbon 
whiskey, cane sugar, and a custom blend of spiced orange bitters. Every sip is deliciously balanced between the 
sweetness of muddled sugar and caramel notes of Bourbon, and the citric zest of orange and bite of aromatic 
bitters. We like it best served simply over ice, though it certainly takes stunningly well to being mixed with 
an equal part of sparkling water and garnished with an Amarena Cherry [sku 60745]. While we can keep it 
in stock, you can find 750 mL bottles of Trader Joe's Old Fashioned for $16.99* (or per market), during the 
holiday season. Look for it in our spirits section.

day technology with old-world recipes. In this particular case, they're using top-fermenting ale yeast that is 
fermented at colder, lager-style temperatures. This creates an ale-lager hybrid in the Kölsch style. Ingredients 
include German ale yeast, quality two-row malted barley, and Hallertauer & Tetnang hops. With a golden straw 
hue and a creamy head, this beer presents a light-hop profile that's delicious and refreshing.

Summer Brew is ready to pair with all the foods that go along with the warmer months. Enjoy while grilling 
burgers and Uncured Bavarian Brats [sku 57632]. Or savor some poured in a chilled glass and paired with a 
crisp, Lemony Arugula Basil Salad [sku 66293] and sautéed Argentinian Red Shrimp [sku 70359]. 

Formerly available in glass bottles, Josephsbrau Summer Brew is now available in six-packs of 12-ounce 
cans. Cans not only protect beer from damaging light exposure, but they are also more often and more easily 
recycled than glass bottles. They're also faster to chill, and virtually unbreakable. So, grab some Summer Brew 
cans at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, pop the top, and drink up!

Rum might just be the finest rum we've ever carried. Not just the finest rum from Panama, not just the finest 
barrel-aged rum, not even just the finest rum we've ever sold for under twenty dollars  -the finest rum, period. 
What's the secret behind such smooth, sippable success? Each batch spends at least five whole years aging in 
100% Bourbon barrels, before being finished in wine barrels, which not only mellows out its edges, but imparts 
some delicately spiced aromatics to accentuate its naturally caramel-y profile.

So, how best to enjoy such an eminently easy-drinking spirit? We find that it makes an excellent sipping rum, 
simply served neat or on the rocks. That said, we certainly wouldn't discourage mixing it with a bit of club 
soda, pineapple juice, or Organic Coconut Water [sku 65256], or even using it as the star of a minty mojito or 
refreshing Hemingway daiquiri. As far as food goes, we'd reccomend pairing it with spicy, full-flavored fare, 
like a seared steak with Chimmichurri [sku 73649] or a peppery pulled pork sandwich.

both apple and pineapple juice. Every sip of this limited run Ale has a bright, juicy, and inviting mix of sweet 
and sour, making it the ideal choice for tipping back during the sunny season of late spring/early summer.

Ably balanced and eminently easy-drinking, this Peach Ale pairs quite peachy-keen-ily with all sorts of

Bavarian Style Hefeweizen. Though it's made for us through a partnership with one of the foremost crafter 
breweries of the West Coast, it's brewed with imported malt and hops under the strictest interpretation of the  
Reinheitsgebot, a strict set of laws from 16th century Bavaria that determined that beers could only contain 
barley, hops, and water. Of course, the Reinheitsgebot has been updated since the 16th century to make way for 
other beer styles, including Hefeweizen, which necessarily includes wheat in its recipe.

Josephsbrau Hefeweizen is fermented with a special wheat beer yeast strain from Bavaria (hefeweizen literally 
means: ""wheat yeast""). This unique yeast produces an array of flavors typical of an authentic Hefeweizen 
including: citrus, clove, banana, and even hints of bubble gum. This beer's unfiltered golden color, combined 
with its lightly hopped, lightly malted character, makes it wonderfully refreshing to sip by itself. It also pairs 
extremely well with a grilled Uncured Bavarian Bratwurst [sku 57632] or our Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage

We loved its tropical fruit notes and round character and think our customers will continue to be blown 
away by the value in this bottle. 

 
Paso Robles benefits from the largest swing between high daytime and low nighttime temperatures of 
any region in California as a result of the cool marine air that flows east through the Templeton Gap 
and south along the Salinas River Valley from the Monterey Bay. The region's summer is characterized 
by warm, clear days, generally unencumbered by clouds, fog or severe winds. This temperature 
fluctuation is considered a key by winemakers and wine grape growers to attain the intense varietal 
character displayed in wine grapes from the area. This Chardonnay showcases what this region can 
really do to a white's flavor - lively and crisp with a refreshing and round finish. The all-tank

"047536","Espiral Vinho Verde","Straight from the lush vineyards of northwest Portugal's Vinho Verde region comes a spritely little 

number that'll have your taste buds dancing a lively jig! This wine is a vivacious and zesty white that 

practically twirls out of the bottle, eager to enliven your senses. With a pale green-yellow hue reminiscent of 

springtime meadows, it beckons you in with a crisp, citrusy fragrance kissed by hints of white flowers and 

mineral notes, carries on with a zippy acidity that's perfectly balanced by a touch of sweetness and a lively 

spritz of effervescence.  

This charming Vinho Verde hails from the coolish northwestern borders of Portugal where the terroir 

is simply sublime for producing these light, frisky whites. The grapes are handpicked in the region's granite 

soils, misty ocean breezes, and mild temperatures conspire to create a lip-smacking acidity and lively 

character in the grapes. An expert blend of regional staples like Loureiro, Pederna, and Azal, the Espiral 

captures the quintessential Vinho Verde spirit with its zingy freshness and featherweight 9% alcohol. 

What to sip this sprightly gem with? We'd suggest leaning into its joyful, warm weather vibes with some 

seasonal fares. A platter of briny oysters or other fresh seafood would be splendid, as would some zesty 

ceviches or shrimp cocktail. Salads topped with zippy vinaigrettes, goat cheese, and fruits like melon or 

mango would also pair marvelously. Or take a cue from the Portuguese and enjoy it as the perfect refreshing 

apéritif while snacking on some briny green olives and flaky bacalhau fritters. However, you serve it, this 

vivacious vinho is pure sunny summertime bliss in a glass!","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/47536.png","4.99","[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"061457","Rebuttel Chardonnay","Rebuttel is certainly not the first California Chardonnay we've brought in - our customers 
love Chards from CA! What's great for us (and more, importantly, the customer) is that Chardonnay 
is one of the most reliably versatile varietals out there. Therefore, while last year at this time, we 
brought in the butteriest and toasty oakiest end of the Chard spectrum with Big Churn, this year we 
went the other way - a Rebuttal (or, in this case, a Rebuttel), if you will. This Chardonnay is elegant, 
dry and fruity with a just a hint of oak. This is truly a great value for top quality wine and since it's an 
ongoing item, you're safe to put in on your shopping list every week! 

 
Winemakers Notes: 
The grapes for the Rebuttel were source predominantly from the Lodi and Central Coast AVAs. This

"063610","Espada Pequeña Mezcal","With its distinctively smoky character and hints of sweet agave, it's no wonder that mezcal has gained quite a 
following in recent years. In response to this striking spirit's rise in popularity, we decided the time was right 
to bring in our own private label, and went straight to the source: a distillery in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico 
that performs every step of the processing, from the growing and harvesting of the agave, to the roasting and 
fermenting, and even the bottling, on-site. When they're done, they call it Espada Pequeña Mezcal, the newest 
addition to our spirits section.

To understand this Mezcal's appeal, it helps to know a little how it's made. First, our distillery partner takes 
their estate-grown agave and roasts it in conical, underground pits, a process which both releases the agave 
nectar from the plant and gives it its signature smoky notes (tequila, which is technically a kind of mezcal, has 
a similar process, but uses above-ground brick ovens for roasting, which results in far less smoke in the finished 
product). Then, their head mezcalero, a third-generation mezcal distiller, ferments the nectar using traditional 
methods passed down through the decades. The result is a sublimely smoky Mezcal, slightly sweet, a little 
green and savory, and with a satisfyingly citric edge. It's marvelously full-flavored when served straight up, and 
brings a tantalizingly smoky earthiness when mixed into cocktails. Other mezcals on the market may go for top 
shelf prices, but at Trader Joe's, you can find 750 mL bottles of Espada Pequeña Mezcal for $19.99*, every day.

great easy to drink cabernet-syrah crafted in the purest French tradition with a modern style. 

 
Winemakers Notes: 
The Cabernet Sauvignon and the Syrah come from a warm part of Languedoc, near Béziers. The 
naturally low yield and the climate allow the grapes to reach a complete phenolic ripeness and the wine a 
great smoothness. The vinification is carried out traditionally in concrete tanks, under controlled 
temperature. The wine is aged a few months with French oak staves.

"074058","Reserve Merlot Sonoma Valley 2020","Merlot. Yes, Merlot. Merlot has long gotten a bad rap. Merlot vines are hearty, easy to grow, and 
productive. The wines can range from easy-drinking, grape-y and approachable to intense, rich and 
delicious. (As opposed to the praise lavished on finicky, difficult to grow, unpredictable results Pinot 
Noir, we suppose.) Frankly, the ""complaints"" about Merlot are basically compliments. Merlot wines are 
consistently good to great. And the best still tend to be much less expensive than equally good 
Cabernet Sauvignon. 
Similarly, the Sonoma Valley, which is much larger and diverse than Napa, tends to produce equally 
wonderful wines that cost a fraction of the price of wines from the uber-prestigious Napa Valley. 
Enter Trader Joe's 2020 Reserve Sonoma Valley Merlot. When the panel first tasted the wine, from one 
of our favorite partners, we loved it. The wine is spectacular. Intense, complex ripe fruit, with notes of 
berries, cocoa and spice. The wine has silky smooth tannins and a firm backbone. It's balanced, rich 
and delicious. And because it's Merlot, and it's from the Sonoma, as opposed to the Napa, Valley (and 
because we're us, so we bought a LOT, put it in our label and paid cash), it's a fantastic value.

Wisconsin, this is a rich and alluringly aromatic India Pale Ale that conjurs complex notes of tropical fruit 
and citrus zest with every estimable sip. Its near-opaque, Hazy appearance is a visually-intriguing byproduct 
of adding hops late into the brewing process, which helps preserve the maximum amount of hoppy flavor and 
helps create an almost creamy mouthfeel. In other words, this is a seriously hoppy IPA.

We recommend drinking Boatswain Hazy IPA in a tall, frosted glass, paired up with spicy entrées or snacks 
- food that will hold its own next to this IPA's creamy bitterness. Something like our Mini Spicy Pumpkin 
Samosas [sku 68408], grilled shrimp glazed with Hot & Sweet Pepper Jelly [sku 96534], or a plate of Nashville

Winemakers Notes: 
Carneros (also known as Los Carneros) is an AVA (American Viticultural Area) that straddles parts of 
both Sonoma and Napa County, just north of San Pablo Bay. Due to the cool fog and breezes from the 
bay, the climate in this AVA is cooler and more moderate than some of the wine regions further north in 
Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley. This cooler climate has made Carneros attractive for the cultivation of 
Burgundy varietals like Chardonnay, Cremant de Bourgogne and, used in this wine, Pinot Noir. This wine

Winemakers Notes: 
In this blend, there are about ten different lots from our Estate vineyards, about 69.2% Mahoney Ranch 
in Napa Carneros and 23.56% from our other Carneros vineyards. We grow more than a dozen different 
clones of Pinot Noir, and in most vintages have about 20 individual lots. Most of the fermentations are 
small, between 4 and 12 tons. Our winemaking approach seeks to preserve fruit character, and create 
wines with pleasing acidity and softer tannin profiles. We tend to ferment cooler than many folks to 
accentuate fruit flavors, and use gentle cap management techniques to avoid harsh tannins. All these lots 
undergo malolactic fermentation in barrel, and many also see batonnage, or stirring of the yeast lees, in 
the barrel. Generally, the wines from the Estate see between 15-18 months in barrel (16 months in the 
case of this blend) long aging by California standards for Pinot Noir. We limit new oak to about 10-15% 
for most of our wines, though this blend has somewhat closer to 20% new French oak.

for ringing in the New Year, and even for just reveling in an evening in with good friends. And when you 
put that bubbly in a big, beautifully decorated, fantastically festive bottle? Now, that's truly something 
special. For example, our Incanto Prosecco 1.5L (SKU 97379), a magnificent magnum of Prosecco, is 
one of our all-time favorites - and our customers love it, too. We felt the time was right to bring in a 
French cousin to the Incanto, so we reached out to a trusted French winery partner (actually a collective 
of wineries and winemakers based in Alsace) that specializes in crisp, delicious sparklers. The result is the 
L'Eclat (French for ""burst,"" as in a ""burst of laughter""), a superbly delicious Blanc de Blancs wrapped in 
a bold and eye-catching design that positively shouts ""I'm celebrating something!"" Our panel instantly 
fell in love - twice the cheery, snappy effervescence, in a bottle that's practically already gift-wrapped, for 
half the price you'd pay anywhere else for French Blanc de Blancs? It can't be overstated: The L'Eclat is 
one big value.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/61644.png","14.99","[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"097379","Incanto Prosecco","¿ 
 
We introduced the Incanto 1.5L a few years ago after a chance 
meeting with a winery that specializes in Prosecco during a wine-
hunting trip in Italy. The winery itself is actually a co-op (many 
wineries belong and contribute grapes) and their resident 
winemaker is somewhat of a wizard with Sparkling wine.   
 
We were immensely impressed with their state-of-the-art facility, 
and their outstanding Proseccos only impressed us further.  We 
figured they would be the perfect partner to team up with for a 
large bottle of Prosecco for the holidays. Several years later, and 
the Incanto 1.5L is now a mainstay of our holiday wine selections 
and a consistent customer favorite every year. Need a 
recommendation for a customer who's hosting a dinner party? 
Look no further - the Incato Prosecco 1.5L is a perfect fit.

It is part of the larger Monterey AVA, and located in the Santa Lucia Mountains above the Salinas

level, with about half of them planted to the Pinot noir grape. The region enjoys cool morning fog and 
breezes from Monterey Bay followed by warm afternoons thanks to direct southern exposures to the 
sun, then cool evenings. The AVA is perfect for growing Pinot Noir (and Chardonnay), producing 
concentrated, complex, and well-structured Pinots. Trader Joe's 2020 Platinum Reserve Santa Lucia 
Highlands Pinot Noir is, simply put, a super wine. The flavor is dense, deep and textured. It's intense.

Aside from obvious serve-and-sip enjoyment, Pumpkin Spice Cream Liqueur is the key ingredient for a boozy

"158268","Boatswain Double I.P.A.","Have we taken the nautical nomenclature too far? What do ""boats"" have to do with beer? First, a quick tutorial: a 
boatswain (that's BOE-sun) is an unlicensed member of the deck department on a merchant ship. The boatswain 
supervises the other deck crew. The boatswain is a hard worker, reliable, and often goes unnoticed. Boatswain 
Double I.P.A. lives up to two of those three descriptors - once you have a taste of it, it certainly won't go 
unnoticed.

Brewed exclusively for Trader Joe's by an award-winning craft brewer in Wisconsin, this is a robust ale that's 
intensely hoppy - its recipe includes a boat-load of hops! - and includes just the right amount of malt to balance 
the hops' bitter profile. At 8.4% alcohol, this is not a brew for the faint of heart. What it is, however, is an I.P.A. 
for the serious craft beer drinker, the brew aficionado who's always looking for something new and interesting 
to drink. You know who you are. This one's for you. Sip it with spiced dishes like barbecue or Thai curries like 
Vegetable Panang Curry [sku 98680]. Try it with sharp cheeses like aged Cheddar or Grand Blue [sku 55344]. 

For years we sold Boatswain Double I.P.A. in 650ml bottles. Recently, we made the decision to offer it in 12 
ounce (355ml) cans instead. Opening up a 12 ounce can is less of a commitment than opening up a nearly-24 
ounce bottle, and you really can't beat our price of $4.99 (or per market), plus deposit where required, for a 
6-pack of cans. The serious beer geeks out there surely know that Trader Joe's is a reliable source for this kind of 
hard working value that won't go unnoticed.

"097401","Kentucky Bourbon","We've been searching for some time to find a high-quality 
producer to make a private label true Kentucky Bourbon.  Who 
knew how hard that was??   
 
At long last, we are able to present Trader Joe's Kentucky 
Bourbon Straight Whiskey.  This distiller actually makes one of the 
best branded Bourbons on the market.  We were excited when we 
tasted this and even more excited after seeing the final product.  
This is a significant value given that it is aged a minimum of 5 
years and should really complement our Bourbon selection. 

Bourbon Overview 
The word ""Bourbon"" derives from Bourbon County, KY (located in the central Bluegrass Region of 
Kentucky).  By law, all Bourbons must contain a ratio of at least 51 percent corn to other grains 
like wheat and most distillers use 65 to 75 percent corn.  Bourbon must be aged for a minimum 
of two years in new, white oak barrels that have been charred. Nothing can be added at bottling 
to enhance flavor, add sweetness or alter color. 
 
Straight Whiskey 
Straight bourbons are produced by the sour-mash method where ""backset"" (liquid from a 
previous distillation) is added to the mash in addition to yeast. The backset helps to make the 
next batch of bourbon similar to the previous ones by passing on some of the characteristics of 
the previous batches (this is similar to using a ""starter"" when making sourdough bread).","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/liquor/97401.png","14.99","[""A Long Finish"",""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,

If you blend or you shake,
Then I'm the rum that you've looked for,

Take a sip and escape.
-with apologies to Rupert Holmes

Avast, me hearties! If you're looking for a superb summer spirit that plays well with others, then say ""Ahoy!"" to 
Trader Joe's White Rum Of The Gods. Made of pure cane sugar and distilled in Barbados (aka the birthplace 
of rum), it's a clear, 80-proof (40% ABV) liquor that offers a soft hint of allspice in the nose, and a light caramel-
sweetness on the palate with a clean finish. This fairly neutral flavor profile makes it a marvelous mixing 
partner, whether you prefer a Daiquiri, Mojito, or of course, a Piña Colada.

After it's distilled in Barbados, this White Rum Of The Gods travels the high seas (and then the highways) 
in bulk via ""flexi-tanks"" to a bottling plant in Wisconsin. This reduces the cost of transportation, without 
sacrificing the quality and authenticity of what's inside the bottle-which is why we're able to offer 750mL 
bottles of Trader Joe's White Rum of the Gods for a few doubloons¿er, dollars lower per bottle than we've 
seen elsewhere. It's a swashbuckling value you'll only find in the Spirits section at your neighborhood Trader 
Joe's (where liquor is sold).

"067300","Kentucky Best Straight Bourbon Whiskey","Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey, by definition, must include a mashbill - the recipe of grains - that includes 51% 
- 80% corn. Most Kentucky Bourbon is made with rye as the second ingredient. Some, though, have a higher 
percentage of wheat than rye, and recently, these ""wheaters"" or ""wheated whiskeys,"" have been gaining in 
popularity and prestige. 

Our Kentucky Best Straight Bourbon Whiskey is a ""wheated"" Bourbon, and delivers the big, round body 
and full flavor that mark this style created by this mash. Kentucky Best is aged four years in new, charred 
American oak barrels; the finished result is an 80 proof Whiskey (40% alcohol) that's highlighted by notes of 
honey and butter, as well as hints of plums and raisins. Straight up or on the rocks, each sip finishes long and 
warm and lingers on your tongue. We especially enjoy slow-sipping Kentucky Best with a dessert spread of 
dark chocolate, sharp cheeses, and dried fruits.

a crisp, refreshing explosion of flavors, showcasing juicy grapefruit, gooseberry, and a hint of green bell

This wine's distinctive character is a direct reflection of Marlborough's unique terroir. The cool maritime 

climate, with its abundant sunshine and long growing season, allows the grapes to develop intense flavors 

while retaining their natural acidity. The region's alluvial soils, rich in gravel and clay, impart a subtle 

mineral complexity to the wine, enhancing its depth and structure. 

 

Picton Bay Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc is incredibly versatile when it comes to food pairings. Its bright 

acidity and herbaceous notes make it an excellent match for fresh seafood dishes, particularly oysters, grilled

Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, from Italy's Abruzzo region, is considered one of Italy's top wine exports.

fish, shellfish or as the accompaniment to the fruit and cheese plate.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/70943.png","7.99","[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"070614","TJ Petit Reserve Chardonnay Mendocino County","Mendocino is a huge, and incredibly diverse, wine region in Northern California. It is home to some of 
the absolute best areas for producing everything from warm-climate Cabernet to cool-climate 
Chardonnay and Pinot Noir (Mendocino's Anderson Valley is one of the most prestigious Pinot Noir 
regions in the world). And much of ""Napa"" wineries ""North Coast"" wine is sourced in Mendocino. The 
panel is constantly tasting Mendocino wines, and, generally-speaking, we like them? When we tasted 
what is now Trader Joe's Petit Reserve Mendocino Chardonnay, we were hooked! Ripe, bright fruit, 
hints of peach, apple and pear, and a beguiling buttery richness balanced w ith a clean, crisp finish. It's 
tasty! 
Pair it with everything from poultry to pork to seafood, and we think you'll get hooked too. And 
because we bought as much as we could, directly from the winery, and put it in our label, it's priced 
where you can enjoy it every day. Cheers!","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/70614.png","7.99","[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,

the stores, and at ""Trader Joe's"" (so incredible value) prices. The panel is rarely surprised, however. 
When we agreed to sample the Peach wine that is now Love Olivia Peach, our expectations, frankly, 
we're not very high. And we were totally surprised. Love Olivia Peach is sweet, but satisfyingly so, 
rather than cloyingly so, and full of ripe, delicious Peach flavor. It's quite good! And we already know 
our customers LOVE our fruit flavored wines. The Peach Bellini, Mangocini  and all the rest are some of 
our absolute top-selling wines at Trader Joe's. Knowing that, we made a deal for an absurd amount, 
directly from the winery, and put it into this control label, and voila, now all this delicious fruity fun

"070152","Cecilia Beretta Prosecco Rosé","Our customers, and the tasting panel, love Prosecco! And it's easy to taste why. Prosecco is the famed 
Northern Italian Sparkling wine that is crisp and bubbly, but with just the right touch of floral nose, 
fruitiness and a hint of sweetness. It tastes great and is too easy to drink. 
After many years of consideration, the Italian government now allows the wineries of Prosecco to 
make a Rose. Prosecco has always been made from one variety of grape, Glera, but for Rose, a small 
amount of Pinot Noir is allowed. Cecilia Beretta, long one of our favorite Prosecco producers, blends 
8.5% Pinot Noir with the balance of Glera. The result is delicious. All the fruit, aroma and hint of 
sweetness of traditional Prosecco, but with a touch more body and structure, and that beautiful 
coppery rose color. It's fantastic! Excellent on its own, of course, as an aperitif, or try it with the fruit 
and cheese plate, or with a shellfish dinner. Saluti!","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m306/wine/70152.png","10.99","[""Bibulous"",""Glass Half Full""]",,
"062093","Tequila Blanco","Although whiskey continues to demand top billing in the spirits world, tequila has experienced a renaissance 
of its own, with a resurgence of artisan distillers creating superb quality product (albeit in limited amounts). 
Our product developers have procured a number of limited, regional tequila buys that fit this bill, all the while 
pursuing a partnership that could yield enough tequila auténtico for all of our customers to enjoy (all of our 
customers who shop in Trader Joe's where spirits are sold, of course). We're excited to say they've achieved this 
goal, with Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco, the newest addition to our private label spirits collection.

Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco is made for us by a family-owned distillery in Jalisco, Mexico, using processes 
that have been handed down over four generations. Jalisco's rocky soil produces blue agave with a higher sugar 
content than other growing regions-in turn, this carefully cultivated agave produces sweeter and fruitier 
tequila. Thanks to the gentle extraction and fermentation of the 100% blue agave juice, our Tequila Blanco is 
a smooth, bright spirit, offering notes of fresh lemon and black pepper with each sip, and a clean, crisp finish.

Thanks to its clean, zesty flavors and refreshing mouthfeel, Trader Joe's Tequila Blanco would be right at home 
in a tequila sunrise or margarita (on the rocks, with salt, if you please). And thanks to its incredible price of 
$19.99 per 750mL bottle, it can be right at home on your liquor shelf-at five dollars lower per bottle than prices 
we've seen elsewhere for tequila of this incredible quality. Find them with our other spirits.

"068120","Organic Charles Shaw Red Blend","In 2018, we added a new twist to the phenomenon that is Charles Shaw Wine - due to some savvy negotiating 
on our part, and some seriously skilled winemaking on the part of our longtime partners, we were able to 
introduce Shaw Wines made with Organic Grapes and offer them at tremendously value-driven prices. We've 
offered a number of different varietals since then, and we always seem to run out of the current vintage before 
the next vintage is ready to bottle. We've recently launched Shaw Red Blend made with Organic Grapes, for 
two reasons. One, it's a really smooth, easy-drinking wine. And two, because it's crafted with a blend of grape 
varietals, we can (hopefully) keep it on the shelves even when the single-varietal wines are harder to find.

A rich, ruby-red hue suggests bold fruit flavors, and the Wine really delivers. Aromas of fresh fruit lead to 
berry-forward flavors, silky tannins, and a hint of toasted oak at the finish. This Red Blend was made for 
sipping with your favorite foods¿ we're thinking smoky barbecue, hearty mac & cheese, or buttery seafood 
dishes like shrimp scampi or cracker-crumb-crusted baked scallops. We're selling each 750mL bottle of Shaw 
Red Blend made with Organic Grapes for $3.99*, every day.

"068814","Small Batch Vodka","When our tasting panel first tasted this vodka, the comments we heard most were ""mellow,"" ""clean-tasting,"" 
""crisp,"" and ""smooth."" We wholeheartedly agree with all of these assessments! Trader Joe's Small Batch Vodka 
10X Distilled comes to us from a small-batch distiller in the upper Midwest. It's distilled from corn, making it 
naturally gluten free (it's vegan, too, for those keeping track). The secret to the smooth flavor profile, though, 
begins with the water. Yep, the water. It's sourced from a natural, limestone-filtered aquifer about 1,300 feet 
below the distillery. The Vodka is Distilled 10 Times, to remove any and all impurities, and then charcoal 
filtered to ensure the cleanest, smoothest flavor. It's higher in alcohol than most vodkas, at 88 proof (44% 
alcohol), and yet, it comes without any of the ""heat"" often associated with such high alcohol spirits.

It also comes without the high price often associated with such high quality spirits. We're selling each 750mL 
bottle for $9.99, a terrific value you'll find only at Trader Joe's.

"159714","Boatswain American I.P.A.","Have we taken the nautical nomenclature too far? What do ""boats"" have to do with beer? First, a quick tutorial: a 
boatswain (that's BOE-sun) is an unlicensed member of the deck department on a merchant ship. The boatswain 
supervises the other deck crew. The boatswain is a hard worker, reliable, and often goes unnoticed. Boatswain 
American I.P.A. lives up to two of those three descriptors - once you have a taste of it, it certainly won't go 
unnoticed.

Brewed exclusively for Trader Joe's by an award-winning craft brewer in Wisconsin, this is an abundantly hoppy, 
respectably bitter ale, with just the right amount of malt to balance the crisp, hop-forward profile. At 6.7% 
alcohol, this is not a brew for the faint of heart. What it is, however, is an American I.P.A. for the serious craft 
beer drinker, the brew aficionado who's always looking for something new and interesting to drink. You know 
who you are. This one's for you. Sip it chilled while flipping burgers on the barbecue. Pair it with tangy Cave Aged 
Blue Cheese[sku 90798] or Raw Milk Aged Cheddar [sku 75227].

For years we sold Boatswain American I.P.A. in 650ml bottles. Recently, we made the decision to offer it in 
12-ounce (355ml) cans instead. Opening up a 12-ounce can is less of a commitment than opening up a nearly 
24-ounce bottle, and you really can't beat our price of $4.99 (or per market), plus deposit where required, for a 
6-pack of cans. The serious beer geeks out there surely know that Trader Joe's is a reliable source for this kind of 
hard working value that won't go unnoticed.

"074557","Petit Reserve Cabernet Franc Paso Robles 2021","Of course, the tasting panel LOVES Cabernet Franc. Genetically, Cabernet Franc is the parent 
varietal to both Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (as the name implies, Cabernet Sauvignon was 
made by crossing Cabernet Franc with Sauvignon Blanc¿and the rest, as they say, is history). And 
while the kids are now much more famous than the parent (as sometimes happens with humans, 
too). But given the rich, complex, well-structured wines that are made from Cabernet Franc grapes, 
maybe we should have just stuck with the original. When the panel tasted what is now Trader Joe's 
2022 Petit Reserve Paso Robles Cabernet Franc, we were hooked. The wine is bright, rich and 
vibrant. The nose is black cherry and plum, with the addition of mocha and toasty oak in the 
mouth. Because it's Cab Franc, the wine has lots of firm tannins and acidy. The result is a wine 
that's both full-bodied and smooth, but with enough zing that it leaves your mouth watering for 
more. It's also yet another example of how many great wines are coming out of Paso Robles now. 
Try a bottle (or at this price, two bottles) with your next grilled Ribeye. Cheers!
