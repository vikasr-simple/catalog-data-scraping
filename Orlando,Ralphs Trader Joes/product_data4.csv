"060842","Egg Nog Whole Milk Greek Yogurt","Originating in medieval Britain, it wasn't until eggnog made its way to the American colonies that it received 
holiday hero status. George Washington even created his own recipe-although, somewhat embarrassingly, he 
didn't specify the exact number of eggs to add to said nog. In any case, with its warm spices and velvety texture, 
it's easy to see why eggnog became a classic seasonal flavor that transcended the original beverage and popped 
up in all manner of candies, cookies and treats in our stores through the years. And because we want to keep 
that tradition of innnovation going, we've developed Trader Joe's Eggnog Whole Milk Greek Yogurt.

Like our Avocado Citrus and Matcha yogurts, our Eggnog Yogurt starts with tart, thick, whole milk Greek 
yogurt that's packed with protein (11 grams per serving, to be exact). A flavored egg nog base filled with egg 
yolks, natural flavors and classic nutmeg spice is added, creating an even creamier texture and lending loads of 
eggnog flavor, along with its signature light-golden hue. And while it would be quite at home on a brunch buffet 
with warm coffee cake, or in a breakfast bowl with granola, it's sweet enough on its own for dessert.

You'll find 5.3-ounce cups of Trader Joe's Eggnog Whole Milk Greek Yogurt in our dairy case this holiday 
season. And to keep our tradition of value going, we're selling each kosher-certified cup for just $0.99.

"079482","Butter with Brown Sugar & Maple Syrup","Maple-mania at Trader Joe's knows no bounds during the fall-even our dairy case is getting in on the fun, 
with Trader Joe's Butter with Brown Sugar & Maple Syrup! It's made for us in small batches by a creamery 
with an uncommon knack for compound butters, who mixes rich brown sugar and deep, dark, grade-A maple 
syrup into smooth, salted butter. It all results in a sublimely sweet-savory flavor profile and oh-so-spreadable, 
punctuated-by-pops-of-sugar-crystal texture that simply screams ""autumn.""

Our Butter with Brown Sugar & Maple Syrup is a boon to breakfast dishes of all kinds, from the expected 
(placed on a stack of pancakes or waffles, spread over a toasted English Muffin [sku 14626] or flaky croissant) 
to the unconventional (melted over crispy Hashbrowns [sku 94769] or a cheesy omelet, used in a breakfast 
sausage sandwich or savory grits). That said, it's an excellent asset at the dinner table, too-especially with rolls 
during a holiday feast or family get-together. We recommend placing a pat on a freshly pan-seared or air-fried 
Salmon Fillet [sku 21717] and letting it melt, just prior to serving.

"072270","Organic Pasture Raised Large Brown Eggs","Some would consider 'pasture-raised' to be the gold standard for chicken eggs. That's why we're excited to be 
making Organic Pasture-Raised Eggs available in some of our stores in the Southwest!

These Chino Valley Ranchers Pasture-Raised Eggs comes from certified organic, family-owned farms, where 
the chickens live outside most of the time, free to forage for bugs, seeds, or whatever they are inclined to eat. 
Even 'free-range' fowl don't get this kind of freedom! More specifically, Chino Valley Ranchers provide at least 
108 sq. ft. of pasture per bird, which is far, far beyond what the USDA requires for 'free range' chickens.

And this approach is not only beneficial for the birds, but it's also excellent for the eggs. These Organic Pasture-
Raised Eggs are large and brown, with rich, golden yolks, and outstanding flavor. If you're shopping at Trader 
Joe's in Arizona, California, Nevada, or Utah-you're in luck; you'll be able to find one-dozen cartons of these 
Pasture-Raised Eggs every day in your neighborhood store.

a generously sized 32-ounce tub with a resealable lid.

If you're not yet a fan, after one spoonful you'll be delighted by this Whole Milk Yogurt imbued with exquisite 
Vanilla flavor. Greek Yogurt, best known for its tart flavor and thick texture, becomes all the more velvety 
when made with Grade A Whole Milk, and boasts an impressive 12 grams of protein per serving. You'll notice 
those characteristic little black specks throughout the product-those are pieces of Vanilla Bean that deliver 
flavor you can see as well as taste (heavy on the taste), further buoyed by the addition of natural vanilla flavor.

Mix our Vanilla Bean Greek Yogurt with a hearty scoop of Just the Clusters Vanilla Almond Granola Cereal
[sku 81814] for an extra crunch and an easy breakfast or snack. Or, use this Yogurt in place of ice cream and
sprinkle in some Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips [sku 04529] for a sweet, dessert-y treat.

"042890","Small Curd Cottage Cheese","At Trader Joe's, we truly depend on Customer feedback to inform our new product development. We also depend 
on it to let us know when an existing product might benefit from a small kaizen or two. Typically, products that 
fall into the latter category are products that our Customers already love, but that they might love even more ""if¿"" 

In the case of Trader Joe's Small Curd Cottage Cheese, a staple in our dairy box since 1993, Customers have told 
us (and showed us, in hard-earned dollars spent) that they love it. But they've also told us that they would love it 
even more if we were to remove certain ingredients from its recipe. So as of next week, in a classic TJ's case of, ""You 
asked-we listened!,"" Trader Joe's Small Curd Cottage Cheese will be the same smooth, creamy, lightly sweet & 
slightly tangy Cottage Cheese you love, minus the xanthan gum, the guar gum, and, most notably, the carrageenan. 

For clarification: carrageenans (or carrageenins) are a family of algae and seaweed-based thickeners, emulsifiers, 
and stabilizers, often used in dairy products to maintain textural consistency. We have no evidence to suggest that 
the carrageenan in this or any other private label product could be harmful - We don't sell products that we know 
to be unsafe, ever. But we also don't presume to make our Customers' dietary and shopping decisions for them. So, 
while arguments for a proposed kaizen are always valuable & considered, the simple fact that Customers are asking 
for it is reason enough to move forward and explore our options. 

Some more great news? Our Cottage Cheese might be better than ever, but our price is the same as it's always 
been-$3.19 for a 32-ounce tub.

"077291","Apricot Mango Greek Whole Milk Yogurt","Trader Joe's Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt is made with Grade A Whole Milk. This might conjure images of 
super fatty milk in your mind, but in truth, whole milk is just 'milk as it comes from the cow'-with none of 
its original milk fat removed. And that original milk fat isn't as much as one might think. Whole milk doesn't 
even contain twice as much milk fat as does 2% milk. Still, it's enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a 
creamier texture-a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases.

Beyond the thick, creamy mouth feel, we've also included bits of apricot and mango, with additional fruit 
juices, to give this Yogurt a tinge of tropical flavor. There are also a host of live and active cultures (added after 
pasteurization) meant to help bolster the presence of ""good bacteria"" in your gut. 

Take a tub to work for an easy breakfast. Mix it with some Müesli [sku 56580] for a heartier snack. You can 
enjoy it anytime since you'll always find Apricot Mango Greek Yogurt in our refrigerators.

Passion Fruit Greek Whole Milk Yogurt. 

That's right-Guava Passion Fruit Greek Whole Milk Yogurt. When we sampled this particular flavor combo,

of the most wondrous and awe-inspiring yogurt we've ever tasted! Icelanders call this yogurt skyr (pronounced 
""skeer""). We call it delicious. It's so delicious, in fact, that after experiencing it for ourselves in its land of origin, 
we decided to develop our very own version.

Trader Joe's Icelandic Style Skyr Lowfat Raspberry Yogurt is made from milk that comes from cows never 
treated with rBST hormones. Being Lowfat, it contains 1.5% milkfat. It's also cultured after pasteurization, in 
order to preserve those live and active probiotics. And just like traditional skyr, our Icelandic Style Lowfat 
Raspberry Yogurt is strained so it becomes exceptionally thick & creamy. It's reminiscent of nonfat Greek 
yogurt-but even smoother and with slightly less bite. While our Icelandic Style Yogurt does have sour 
notes,  our supplier also lightly sweetens it, which, along with its natural, residual sweetness, creates a beautiful 
balance. Plus, it's flavored with bits of raspberry to provide an extra pop of ripe, fruity fun into every bite.

a smoothie for a calorically sound, protein boost-each 5.3-ounce serving contains 130 calories and 15 grams

"074710","Vegan Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative","It would be difficult to overstate how far vegan alternatives to dairy have come in just a few short years. For 
instance, it wasn't too long ago that the idea of a totally dairy-and-lactose-free whipping cream was either 
entirely out of the question, or came with considerable compromise-perhaps it would have the right flavor, 
but wasn't quite whippable, perhaps it had the right consistency, but the taste was all wrong. Not so today. In 
fact, today, you can pick up a carton of Trader Joe's Vegan Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative with absolute 
confidence that it will taste, feel, and, crucially, whip, just like its dairy-based counterpart.

As with its plant-derived predecessors Trader Joe's Vegan Cream Cheese Alternative [sku 70942] and Trader 
Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread [sku 71782], the secret behind this Vegan Heavy Whipping Cream Alternative lies 
largely in the ingenuity of its recipe. Our supplier, an expert in non-dairy staples based in Germany, employs a 
carefully balanced mix of vegetable-based oils, starches, and proteins to provide just the right consistency and 
rich, creamy flavor to make this a direct, one-to-one replacement for dairy-based whipping cream. As such, we 
can whole-heartedly recommend it as an ingredient in soups, sauces, and desserts, as a mix-in for coffee, tea, 
or cocoa, and, when whipped until light and fluffy, a topping for milkshakes, mousses, or sweet breakfast treats.

smooth, velvety consistency is pitch-perfect for dressing up coffees and teas, both hot and iced, while its

Heavy cream is the thick, fat-rich portion of milk that rises to the top of fresh milk and can be skimmed off. 
Mandated by law, heavy cream can have a fat content of no less than 36%. A higher milkfat content adds 
moisture and makes for a more gentle, tender texture to any baked good. The ability of heavy cream to hold its 
structure while whipped or thickened in a sauce, yet also create a featherweight lightness to any baked dessert

Admittedly, we can't claim too much genius for the cinnamon part  . But we will claim that this particular 
combination of Honey Crisp Apples, Cinnamon, and creamy, whole-milk Greek Yogurt is an autumnal 
triumph for dairy aficionados... and that's even before considering that each serving (one 5.3-ounce, 170-calorie 
tub) is high in protein and a good source of calcium. Hooray for fall!

dairy staple from family farms to your dining room table - no babushka necessary!

Sour cream is created by fermenting cream with lactic acid bacterial cultures that naturally ""sour"" and thicken 
the starting cream. It has long been an ingredient in Eastern and Central European cuisines, making its way to 
the U.S. and U.K. through westward immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since been kept on hand 
to tame picante Tex-Mex dishes, as well as make quick dips and silky sauces. With a pure and simple ingredient 
list, Trader Joe's Sour Cream delivers the freshest pasteurized cream, milk, corn starch, and live and active 
cultures ready for you to use on your culinary adventures! Whether you're shaping a savory dish or building a 
baked good, each 16-ounce container of Trader Joe's pleasantly piquant Sour Cream can be found every day 
in our dairy fridges.

USDA-certified Organic Milk from Grass Fed Cows is filtered, homogenized, and ultra-pasteurized (held at high

All of our Greek Style Yogurts are strained which is a process 
through which the watery-whey is removed resulting in a naturally 
thickened yogurt with the consistency of sour cream. Straining 
makes Greek yogurts richer in protein than other types of yogurts 
and lower in lactose. The straining process also makes Greek 
yogurts creamier than other types of yogurts and it is great as a 
cooking ingredient because it is less likely to curdle up and separate 
when heated. Serve Trader Joe's Greek Style Plain 0% Yogurt with 
fresh berries or granola for breakfast, or sweeten it up with a bit of 
honey for a satisfying snack anytime.

"086450","Greek Nonfat Yogurt Plain","Ever wonder how Greek yogurt is crafted? Do we culture the milk by reading each batch of yogurt epic Hellenic 
poetry? It couldn't hurt, however Trader Joe's Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt uses a traditional Greek yogurt 
process to yield a deliciously creamy nonfat Greek yogurt.

Each batch of Trader Joe's Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt has its beginnings with grade A pasteurized skim milk 
sourced from cows not treated with rBSt. From there, the milk is heated, cooled to a desirable fermentation 
temperature (approximately 110° F), and topped off with the addition of bacterial cultures. While this bacteria 
grows and produces lactic acid, we prepare for the final step that takes this regular yogurt mixture to the 
Parthenon of pleasant texture and taste. This final, multi-straining step is what separates this Greek God of a 
yogurt from the mere mortals of regular yogurt. The thorough straining of the liquid whey is what gives this 
Greek yogurt a concentrated, powerful flavor and dense, velvety texture. So much of the liquid is strained that 
it can typically take around four cups of raw milk to yield one cup of Greek yogurt. This leaves a concentrated, 
protein-rich yogurt low in sodium and sugar, making for a nutritious snack any time of day! Trader Joe's 
Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is leaping off our dairy shelves for $2.99* per 16-ounce container, every day.

plus just a touch of salt to give it that fresh-from-the-crock feeling. Together, this finely tuned blend creates a 
profoundly Buttery profile that's ideal for spreading over any breakfast bagel, midday muffin, or dinner roll.

As you might surmise from the fact that it's Plant-Based, this Spread is totally free of dairy and lactose, and 
we should also mention that it's gluten-free, soy-free, and kosher (pareve), too. In addition to its appetizing 
applications on a warm slice of toast or pile of pancakes, we've found its already soft consistency makes it a 
great tool for crafting vegan compound butters. Try mixing a few tablespoons with chopped chives, shallots,

our offerings and adjusting them as warranted by sales and direct customer feedback. 

With regard to eggs, we offer a range of choices from both ""conventional"" and ""cage-free"" sources. Currently, 
well over half of the eggs that we sell at Trader Joe's are from cage-free hens, and as we continue to listen to our 
customers (and as the supply-side of the egg business evolves to keep pace with a growing cage-free preference),

in coming up with a 100% plant-based, egg substitute that still cooks and tastes like real eggs. How did they do 
it? The key is lupin beans. These bright-yellow legumes-with a history dating back to ancient Egypt-have 
an egg-like texture and taste when cooked. This means Simply Eggless can be used in just about any way you 
might use real eggs.

Yogurt is definitely a trend-driven category, and, no surprise, Greek yogurt is still the top trend. But that doesn't 
mean that it hasn't evolved. When we first got into the Greek yogurt business years ago, there wasn't much 
variety. Plain, fat free, 2%, and maybe a honey option. But that was more or less the range. Then came the 
flavors. So many flavors. Delicious flavors. Whole milk was suddenly on trend. And then whole milk without 
the flavors was in vogue. 

That brings us to now, and this Plain Greek Yogurt Made with Whole Milk. Here we have the utmost in Greek 
Yogurt simplicity - thick and creamy, smooth and tangy, strained to get that rich, luxurious texture that's  kept 
Greek Yogurt on trend for so many years. It's high in protein and a good source of calcium, delcious on its own

Trader Joe's has sold Greek-style yogurt in a number of everyday and seasonal flavors-with varying milkfat 
levels, and in a variety of sizes. However, what we haven't done is offer a plain, nonfat, single-serve option¿ 
until now!

Trader Joe's Greek Plain Nonfat Yogurt starts with Grade A, skim milk from cows that have never been 
given rBST hormones. (Fun fact: It takes 3 lbs. of milk to make 1 lb. of Trader Joe's Greek Yogurt!) The milk 
is pasteurized, and then cultured with the same live and active cultures we use in our 16 oz. [SKU 86450] & 32 
oz. [SKU 95732] sizes. Finally, it's strained, yielding velvety-textured yogurt with a pleasingly tangy taste. It's 
also high in protein (15g per serving), and a good source of calcium, providing 15% of the daily recommended 
value.

the non-dairy game further still. Its relatively smoother, creamier consistency is pitch-perfect for stirring into 
coffees and teas, both hot and iced, and its delectable note of rich Brown Sugar is present enough to provide 
a pleasant flavor boost, but not so potent as to overpower whatever you've poured it into. Keep a carton in

"097926","Greek Yogurt with Honey","By now you know the story of Greek yogurt-most of the liquid has been strained out, making its texture more 
like that of sour cream. But did you know that's only part of the story? There's a dark secret behind much of 
what's marketed today as ""Greek"" yogurt. You see, to save both time and money, many yogurt manufacturers 
skip that all-important straining process, instead choosing to add thickeners to regular yogurt to achieve a 
similar, creamy texture. We find that more than a little disingenuous for a couple of reasons. One, real Greek 
plain yogurt has no thickeners. And two, real Greek yogurt is significantly higher in protein than its yogurt 
relatives, specifically because of that straining process. We make this vow to you: all of the Greek yogurt at 
Trader Joe's is made using the traditional method of straining the majority of the whey from the yogurt.

In addition to the single-serving size of Greek Yogurt with Honey-made with whole milk from cows not 
treated with rBST-we also offer that same delicious yogurt in a 32-ounce size, equal to at least four individual 
servings. It's smooth and creamy, super-rich, and an ideal balance of yogurt-y tartness and honey sweetness. Each 
eight ounce serving has eight grams of protein and contains live, probiotic cultures including s. thermophilus 
and l. acidophilus which have the potential to aid in healthy digestion. We're selling each 32-ounce container 
with a resealable lid for $4.99, a verifiable value for ""real"" Greek Yogurt, and the same price it's been since we

"006219","Small Curd Cottage Cheese","At Trader Joe's, we truly depend on Customer feedback to inform our new product development. We also depend 
on it to let us know when an existing product might benefit from a small kaizen or two. Typically, products that 
fall into the latter category are products that our Customers already love, but that they might love even more ""if¿"" 

In the case of Trader Joe's Small Curd Cottage Cheese, a staple in our dairy box since 1993, Customers have told 
us (and showed us, in hard-earned dollars spent) that they love it. But they've also told us that they would love it 
even more if we were to remove certain ingredients from its recipe. So as of next week, in a classic TJ's case of, ""You 
asked-we listened!,"" Trader Joe's Small Curd Cottage Cheese will be the same smooth, creamy, lightly sweet & 
slightly tangy Cottage Cheese you love, minus the xanthan gum, the guar gum, and, most notably, the carrageenan. 

For clarification: carrageenans (or carrageenins) are a family of algae and seaweed-based thickeners, emulsifiers, 
and stabilizers, often used in dairy products to maintain textural consistency. We have no evidence to suggest that 
the carrageenan in this or any other private label product could be harmful - We don't sell products that we know 
to be unsafe, ever. But we also don't presume to make our Customers' dietary and shopping decisions for them. So, 
while arguments for a proposed kaizen are always valuable & considered, the simple fact that Customers are asking 
for it is reason enough to move forward and explore our options. 

Some more great news? Our Cottage Cheese might be better than ever, but our price for a 16-ounce tub is the same

to be sure, but as Trader Joe's Vegan Buttery Spread demonstrates, the results are well worth it.

Crafted for us by an expert supplier in Germany, this Spread is made from a mix of vegan ingredients including 
sunflower, coconut, and canola oil, which are mixed with a bit of shea butter, fava bean protein, and just a touch 
of salt to give it an impeccably buttery flavor. What truly sets this Spread apart, however, is the fact that you 
can use it as a 1:1 replacement for traditional dairy-based butter in every way you can think of. It melts like a 
dream, spreads beautifully over bread, and helps create moist and delicious (not to mention perfectly plant-
based) baked goods.

"047906","Light Egg Nog","If any drink has earned a place in the holiday beverage hall of fame, Egg Nog certainly has. Should such a hall 
ever exist (never say never), Egg Nog's jersey would be hanging right alongside those of hot cocoa and apple 
cider, honoring its unfailing ability to turn a cold night cozy.

Egg Nog's icon status has afforded it such a fervent fanbase in our stores, we offer not one, but two versions 
of the stuff: Trader Joe's Egg Nog [sku 47904] and Trader Joe's Light Egg Nog-the latter of which delivers the 
same creamy, nutmeg-infused experience, but with 90% less fat and 40% fewer calories. Whether you'd prefer 
to sip a glass while opening presents on Christmas morning or enjoy a tumbler-full (with a splash of rum, 
perhaps?) in front of the fireplace, both Nogs are up for the job.

"047904","Egg Nog","Though recipes for drinks bearing some relation to egg nog date back more than a thousand years, Egg Nog as 
we know it now likely originated in the English region of East Anglia, with the ""nog"" being a nod to the Middle 
English word ""noggin"" (a.k.a. a small mug used to serve alcohol, not that roughly ten-pound mass that sits on 
your shoulders).

While Egg Nog's exact history might be hard to discern, its present popularity sure isn't-our customers love 
Trader Joe's Egg Nog! Made with whole milk, this sweet, creamy, nutmeg-infused drink is satisfying on its own 
or with a splash of rum; dreamy in a latte or milkshake; and incredibly indulgent in a bread pudding or French 
toast recipe. That's right, we're suggesting Egg Nog bread pudding. And French toast. Oui.

"099283","Greek Nonfat Pumpkin Yogurt","Unlike the traditional American yogurt, Greek yogurt has had most of the liquid drained out, so its texture 
is closer to that of sour cream. As distinctive as its texture is its flavor - creamy and tangy. We fell in love 
with imported Greek yogurt the very first time we tasted it. And now, especially for the season that is Fall, we 
combined it with something else for which we've fallen head-over-heels - Pumpkin. Trader Joe's Nonfat Greek 
Pumpkin Yogurt is the product of our insatiable appetite for all things Greek Yogurt and all things Pumpkin. 
And man, it delivers.

This is thick and creamy yogurt, high in protein, with live, active cultures - there's evidence these help in 
digestion. It's made with real pumpkin puree (that's the second ingredient!) and a blend of seasonal spices like 
nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cloves. It kind of tastes like pumpkin pie. So. If you're craving pumpkin pie, but 
it's breakfast time and you just can't justify that, there's no need to justify a cup of Trader Joe's Nonfat Greek 
Pumpkin Yogurt. After all¿ it's yogurt! It also makes a stunning seasonal parfait layered with our Pumpkin 
Spice Granola [sku 20686] and Pumpkin Butter [sku 06372]. Who needs pie!? (Well, we might not go quite that 
far, but this is a truly satisfying stand-in.)

We're selling 5.3-ounce cups of Nonfat Greek Pumpkin Yogurt for the excellent price of 99¢, every day-  
during Pumpkin Season, that is. Scoop some up before it's gone. You'll find it in our dairy case.

Like the other flavors, there's absolutely no dairy in this product. What is in there includes a base made from

"053720","Cultured Salted Butter","What makes really great butter? A little culture helps. We're not talking about a night at the opera, but about the 
cherished micro-organisms, also found in yogurt and crème fraîche, which unleash depth and a pleasant tang 
in cream. Beyond the enviable culture-elicited flavor, butter is better when churned and churned and churned 
and¿ Lengthier churning lowers the moisture content, increasing the butterfat, and resulting in luxuriously 
creamy texture. And because one good churn deserves another, we're bringing Trader Joe's Cultured Salted 
Butter back to our dairy shelves, after a brief (and what some might call heartbreaking) hiatus.

Trader Joe's Cultured Salted Butter is lightly salted, subtly tangy, enviably creamy, and it's made for us in 
French dairy country, Brittany. You can use it in any culinary application that calls for butter; this Butter shines 
served simply on its own and in baking recipes. Slather it atop a piece of toasted, thick bread, like our French 
Baguette [sku 53835], and take a bite-it's an ethereal experience. It's also wonderful enjoyed melted as a dip 
for mild, peppery Organic Radishes of Many Colors [sku 61844]. And when it comes to baking, quite frankly, 
there is no better Butter for homemade cakes, cookies, pies, and especially ambitious endeavors like croissants.

"070149","Ultra-Filtered Reduced Fat Chocolate Milk","We tend to think of cow's milk as simply ""milk,"" but there's actually quite a few intermediary steps between 
milk being produced by a cow and it reaching your cereal bowl. In the U.S., it's typically pasteurized, for food 
safety, and homogenized, to make sure the cream doesn't separate in the carton. In recent years, the process of 
ultra-filtration has grown in popularity, too. Ultra-filtered milk is created by filtering the milk with a membrane 
so fine that it actually removes the lactose, as well as some of the other sugars that naturally occur in milk. It 
also creates a milk that's comparatively higher in protein and calcium, and even tastes a little creamier. 

Sounds amazing, right? We thought so too, which is why we decided to bring Trader Joe's Ultra-Filtered 
Reduced Fat Chocolate Milk to our refrigerators. Aside from being ultra-smooth, ultra-creamy, and ultra-
chocolatey this 2% milkfat Ultra-Filtered Chocolate Milk is certified lactose free, and made using milk from 
cows not treated with rBST. While it's great for anytime drinking, the fact that each glass already contains 14 
grams of protein makes it a great choice for making protein smoothies. And since ultrafiltration does such a 
good job lowering the sugar content, our Ultra-Filtered Chocolate Milk has about half the sugar of standard 
chocolate milk. Amazing! We're selling 59 fl. oz. cartons in our dairy case, every day.

"067937","New Zealand Salted Butter","The idyllic splendor of New Zealand's South Island (also known as Te Waipounamu) makes a truly awe-
inspiring backdrop for the herds of grazing cows responsible for Trader Joe's New Zealand Salted Butter. As 
they feed on the lush, green grasses of the countryside, they produce milk that tends to be richer and fuller in 
fat than their grain fed counterparts. Our supplier then takes this milk, adds a bit of salt (and, notably, nothing 
else), then uses traditional churning methods to create a profoundly creamy and delicious butter. 

While ideal for spreading over a toasty English Muffin [sku 14626] or Crumpet [sku 14622] with a bit of your 
favorite jelly, jam, or marmalade, our New Zealand Salted Butter is great for adding a little extra creaminess 
to any application that calls for salted butter. Whether it's for baking, making a rich, flavorful sauce, or simply 
topping a pile of mashed potatoes or freshly seared steak, Trader Joe's New Zealand Salted Butter is as 
dependable as it is delicious. And at $3.29* for an eight-ounce stick, it's a genuine everyday value, too. You can 
find it amidst the air-conditioned splendor of our dairy case.

"098188","Vanilla Cultured Coconut Milk","""What in the world is Cultured Coconut Milk?"" would not be a strange or silly question to ask. We asked it, 
too, when we first introduced this product, and now that it's back on our shelves, we wanted to give a refresher. 
You see, we can't technically call this product Coconut Yogurt because it's made with coconut ""milk""-which 
isn't milk in the strict sense of the word. But, if you're looking for a quick and easy explanation of what Vanilla 
Cultured Coconut Milk is, that's pretty much it in a (coco)nut shell.

Trader Joe's Vanilla Cultured Coconut Milk is an excellent alternative to dairy based yogurts. Not only is this 
lil' cup of Cultured Coconut Milk dairy free, but it's also vanilla flavored and contains dairy-free probiotics. 
Tasty and gut-healthy and dairy free? Nice.

Mix it with Ancient Grains and Nuts Granola [sku 56304], Organic Toasted Coconut Granola [sku 57802], or Just 
the Clusters Vanilla Granola [sku 81814]. Add it to your morning smoothie. Eat it right out of the cup. In other 
words, Vanilla Cultured Coconut Milk can do everything yogurts can do-and without the lactose!

We're selling each six-ounce cup of Trader Joe's Vanilla Cultured Coconut Milk for $1.49. You'll find them 
with the products we can call ""yogurt.""

some form) and milk. If you want phenomenal chocolate milk, though, you need to go all out. And all out we 
went with Trader Joe's Chocolate Whole Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa. 

We did not source this Chocolate Whole Milk from chocolate cows. (If only they existed¿) Instead, we started 
by sourcing fair trade cocoa from small family farms in Northern Peru. This cocoa is then mixed with whole 
milk and cane sugar. The resulting concoction is what you'll find in the charming cartons of Chocolate Whole 
Milk. It's truly the most rich, creamy, dreamy Chocolate Milk we could find.

Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies [sku 10727] for dessert before bed. Don't ask us to pick a favorite way to enjoy 
this Chocolate Whole Milk-they're all the best.
