"080125","Pizza Ranch Salad Kit","Would it be hyperbolic to describe pizza as ""universally beloved?"" Perhaps, but it's hard to deny pizza's 
overwhelming popularity, and when you break down the average slice of pizza to its constituent parts, it's 
easy to see why: rich, tangy tomato sauce, super savory cheeses, satisfylingly crisp crust, and herby, aromatic 
seasonings...it's a set of flavors that deserves to be celebrated in other culinary contexts, too. Which is exactly 
why we're introducing Trader Joe's Pizza Ranch Salad Kit to our refrigerators. Made with a base of fresh, 
shredded Romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots, along with a set of pizza-evoking toppings like herby 
flatbread strips, four-cheese crisp crumbles, and grated Parmesan, each Kit also contains a superlatively creamy 
Ranch dressing flavored with seasonings like dried garlic, onion, and tomato powder to tie everything together.

Once tossed together, every bite of this Salad Kit brings to mind the feelings and flavors of a slice of cheese 
pizza, deliciously dipped in Ranch dressing. As such, we can't help but recommend serving it with one of our 
many fantastic frozen pizzas, like our Parlanno [sku 02517], Uncured Pepperoni [sku 55426], or family-sized 
Organic Cheese & Tomato [sku 63121] varieties. That said, it's an equally excellent accompaniment to a hearty 
pasta, soup, or really another other savory entrée you can name. Or, if you'd prefer, it also makes a great entrée 
in its own right when topped with your favorite protein.

"079623","Gluten Free Turkey Gravy","For years, we've sold a wonderful Turkey Flavored Gravy [sku 93173] in a shelf-stable box that you can keep in 
your pantry for a last-minute Turkey Day gravy-or for any day of the week, when the gravy craving creeps up 
on you. But if you have the time and the forethought to get some gravy right when you need it, we recommend 
picking up a tub of our new Gluten Free Turkey Gravy.

This fresh Gravy is kettle cooked in batches and derives its rich turkey flavor from turkey meat and turkey 
fat-the same way you'd make it at home. That richness is complemented by savory herbs (parsley, sage, and 
thyme), making it ideal for topping your roasted Trader Joe's Organic Turkey [sku 57035], your TJ's Gluten Free 
Stuffing [sku 53709], and all your favorite Thanksgiving sides. 

And because we've used cornstarch as a thickener instead of a flour-based roux, this Turkey Gravy is not only 
rich and delicious... it's also Gluten Free! You'll find it in our refrigerators, but only during the holiday season.

"057387","Organic Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts","The relatives are coming, and the last thing you need is one more bristly, high-maintenance project. That's why 
Trader Joe's Organic Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts have been cherished by customers ever since we introduced 
them in our stores in 2014. And, because we believe there is always room for a little kaizen, this year our Peeled 
& Cooked Chestnuts are USDA-certified organic. 

Harvested in Ardèche, France, Trader Joe's Organic Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts are gathered in large nets  
(which hang auspiciously below the trees' branches to catch falling fruit) and expertly hand-shelled. Once shelled, 
the starchy-sweet brown fruits are washed, peeled, steamed, and vacuum-sealed for freshness-so they're ready 
to use right out of the package. Add some Organic Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts to your Thanksgiving stuffing 
or to a nice, warm salad. For another scrumptious seasonal side, combine one package of Chestnuts with one 
package of  TJ's Ready-To-Eat Roasted Brussels Sprouts [sku 53647], add some fresh TJ's Organic Sage [sku 76525], 
sauté in butter or olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Heck, you can even eat Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts 
straight out of the package if you feel so inclined-we're not here to judge. They're truly no-fuss, no-muss. No 
fancy price tag, either. 

Our Chestnuts are truly no-muss, no-fuss, and perhaps best of all, they're also ""no-fancy-price-tag. They might 
be organic this year-a certification that usually brings a cost increase-but we're offering them for not a penny 
more than the conventional Peeled & Cooked Chestnuts of holidays past. Each 6.5-ounce package is just $3.99. 
You'll find them with our refrigerated produce.

"079721","Caesar Broccoli Bake Kit","Our love for Caesar salad is certainly no secret-we've carried countless variations of both Caesar salad and 
Caesar dressing over the years. Only recently, however, have we truly considered what Caesar-y flavors are 
capable of when not constrained within the confines of a salad. Take Trader Joe's Caesar Broccoli Bake Kit, 
for instance. By re-contextualizing the deeply savory, umami-rich flavors and creamy consistency of Caesar 
salad dressing and Parmesan cheese (along with the textural pop of crumbly croutons) to a homey, hearty, 
Baked Broccoli dish, we've found a whole new world for Caesar to conquer. 

Inside each Kit, you'll find fresh broccoli florets, a packet of Caesar-Romano salad dressing, and pouches 
of pre-shredded Parmesan and crispy crouton crumbles. All that's required on your end is a baking sheet 
and oven: simply toss the Broccoli with 3/4 of the salad dressing, bake for 15-20 minutes (to your desired 
doneness) at 425°, sprinkle with the Parmesan and croutons, bake for another 2-4 minutes, then drizzle with 
the remaining dressing. In less than half an hour, you have a ready-to-eat, super flavorful veggie side that will 
complement everything from a quickly-seared steak, to an air-fried Salmon Filet [sku 24455] to a bowl of 
creamy pasta, or even just a simple baked potato.

"079111","Sweet Chili Mango Complete Salad Kit","Combining the congenial crunch of cruciferous veggies like cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts, and radicchio, 
with zesty, mango-forward flavors inspired by Thai cuisine, Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Mango Salad Kit gives 
you everything you need to serve a super tasty salad for your next meal-besides, we suppose, a salad bowl and 
some tongs. Inside each all-in-one Kit, you'll find the aforementioned blend of crisp, shredded veggies, crunchy 
roasted sunflower seeds, toasted quinoa, dried bits of mango, and a Thai-style sweet and spicy vinaigrette. With 
just a quick toss of these ingredients, you'll instantly have a Salad with tangy, tropical flavors and layers of 
complementary textures in every bite.

Equally excellent as a side as it is a main (particularly when topped with your favorite protein), we find that 
this vegan Salad Kit's constituent Sweet Chili Mango flavors are especially suited for serving alongside fare 
like spring rolls, stir-fries, and aromatic curries. That said, we also find that its spicy and fruity aspects make it 
an apt choice for incorporating into seafood tacos, a base for a Tempeh [sku 99125] bowl, or using as a topping 
on a Turkey Burger [sku 96937].

breakfast? Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar and Turkey Sausage Egg White Bites are made for full-flavored 
gobbling on the go!

Courtesy of cage free egg whites, these Bites have the ideal structure for handheld morning meals. Light and 
fluffy on the inside with just enough bite on the outside, they travel equally well to the office as they do from 
your fridge to the microwave. Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923] brings its unique aged Cheddar-Parmesan 
tanginess, while red pepper, black pepper, sage, coriander, and rosemary seasoned turkey sausage packs 17g of 
protein per serving. A touch of cottage cheese rounds off each Bite with satisfying creaminess. 

With two Bites per package, Unexpected Cheddar and Turkey Sausage Egg White Bites are an egg-xpediently 
filling and gluten free breakfast. Remove the outer plastic packaging, microwave for 60 seconds, let stand for 
one minute, and bite right in. They're delicious and satiating right out of the microwave and with enhancements 
when you have an extra minute or two. Dab a dollop of sour cream for a tangy boost, get your veggies in with

In the case of Trader Joe's Crunchy Jicama Slaw, that truly a root-torical question!

Our Slaw comes from Mexico, like the original Jicama root itself. Jicama ""noodles"" make up the base of this 
salad, with julienned carrots and diced radishes, cucumbers, and red bell peppers. The addition of shelled 
edamame brings a bit of protein to the party-3g per one-cup serving, to be precise. 

Inside the 11.5-ounce tub, the Slaw is topped with plenty of leafy, fragrant cilantro. Plus, there's a garnish-ready 
packet of chopped, dry-roasted peanuts for a finishing, nutty crunch. And no slaw-abiding denizen of TJ's 
salad-town would expect anything less than the spicy, sesame ginger dressing that comes in a separate packet, 
ready to add and toss with the veggies-whenever you're ready to eat. On that note, we're ready when you're

"006832","Caesar Salad with White Chicken Meat","Hail, Caesar Salad! Since its invention in the 1920s, the Caesar has reigned supreme as a scion of salad-
dom - although, full disclosure, it actually gets its name from its reported inventor, chef Caesar Cardini; any 
similarities to Roman emperors are purely coincidental. And for close to three decades, Trader Joe's Caesar 
Salad with Chicken has remained a staple of our salad selection. Inspired by the classic recipe, it's made with 
crisp Romaine lettuce, fresh shreds of Parmesan, crunchy croutons, and tender chunks of chicken breast, with 
a packet of zesty, creamy, and triumphantly garlicky Caesar dressing included.

Once mixed together, this Salad exhibits everything you love about the iconic Caesar profile - the crunch, 
the rich flavors, the savory notes of garlic and anchovy - all in one conveniently portable package. Perhaps it's 
the princely air that comes with enjoying such a sumptuous salad in a mundane setting, but even after all these 
years, it remains one of our favorite lunch salads to bring to work. Keep an eye out for nine ounce packages 
of Trader Joe's Caesar Salad with Chicken in our refrigerators the next time you're looking to conquer your

Roll next time you're craving maki. 

Our California Roll is made in the traditional Japanese style, starting with white rice that's seasoned with rice

imitation crab made from Alaskan pollock. It's finished with a sprinkle of white & black sesame seeds.

The Roll is sliced into bite-sized segments that are easily lifted with chopsticks (or fingers) to dip into the 
included organic soy sauce. We've also included a zesty, wasabi-style paste if you want to add a little heat to the

"078937","Spinach & Ricotta Raviolini","Trader Joe's Spinach & Ricotta Raviolini are tiny ravioli that are made for us in Italy by pasta pillow pros. We 
call them ""pros"" because it's very challenging to fill and keep closed such small ravioli. After a year of research 
(no joke!)-and equipped with a new, specially made die to cut the pasta-our Raviolini line was up and 
running.

Each Raviolini is 50% pasta and 50% filling, which is a rare ratio in the stuffed-pasta universe. The pasta is 
formed from a delicate, egg and durum-wheat flour dough. The filling includes spinach in a creamy, garlicky 
bechamel sauce, with a rich blend of ricotta & mozzarella cheeses. 

Given their tiny size, these Spinach & Ricotta Raviolini eat very similar to a plate of tortellini, where you get 
to enjoy a bunch of them in every bite. They're so delicious on their own, you may simply complement them 
with a drizzle of TJ's Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 01465] and a sprinkle of Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano [sku 
83140]. And their slight stature means they're quick cooking and ideal for dropping into a pot of soup just a 
few minutes before it's finished simmering! You'll find 10-ounce packages of Trader Joe's Spinach & Ricotta 
Raviolini in our refrigerators, every day.

"076868","Pulled Chicken Salsa Verde","In addition to developing foods with high-quality ingredients that are combined using exceptional recipes, 
we are also keen to develop Trader Joe's products that are convenient, time-saving meal solutions for our 
customers. Trader Joe's Pulled Chicken Salsa Verde is one of those products that checks all the boxes!

Similar to Trader Joe's Smoked Pulled Chicken [sku 74967], this Pulled Chicken recipe begins with seasoned, 
boneless, skinless Chicken breast. But here, the meat isn't smoked. It's seasoned with salt, white pepper, and 
garlic & onion powders, then slow-cooked in a Salsa Verde that includes roasted tomatillos, green chiles, 
cilantro, onion and garlic. The fully cooked meat is then shredded, so its really easy to tuck into tacos, burritos, 
quesadillas, or to pile on top of chips for nachos. And it'll save you time on a busy weeknight, since all it takes 
to prepare is about four minutes in the microwave. Add a couple more minutes to that if you'd prefer to heat it 
in a saucepan on the stovetop. Either way, you'll have a terrifically tender & flavorful protein you can use in a 
wide variety of simple, satisfying ways. 

There is one more box we like to check on every Trader Joe's product-and that's the value box. What that 
means for Trader Joe's Pulled Chicken Salsa Verde is that you get a full pound of delicious, heat & eat protein 
for $8.99. You'll find it in our refrigerators, every day.

"074459","Lemon Herb Macaroni Salad","Modeled after a popular modern take on the classic recipe, Trader Joe's Lemon Herb Macaroni Salad is not 
your grandmother's mac. Of course, semolina elbow Macaroni anchors our chilled Salad in nostalgia, and the 
dressing mimics the creamy, mayo-based version of the past. Beyond these familiarities, though, the recipe 
departs for a new era, going lighter on the mayo and incorporating buttermilk, which hints at a tanginess that 
arrives in full with a cucumber, celery, and caper relish in a vinegar, white wine, and lemon juice brine. 

The inclusion of zest locks in the Lemon profile promised in the name, while the Herb component is distinctly 
dill-forward, partnering with parsley and a host of spices and aromatics. Harkening back to your grandma's 
recipe, we have included a touch of sugar (less than one gram of added sugar per serving), which lends a final 
balance to the zestier components. You'll find the 12-ounce tub of picnic-ready Trader Joe's Lemon Herb 
Macaroni Salad in our refrigerators, every day.

"075847","Prosciutto Wrapped Fresh Mozzarella Cheese","The charcuterie board is always enticing, with its array of sliced meats and cheeses, prepped to be piled on

up a notch or two. Trader Joe's first embraced this rolled charcuterie concept with our holiday Rolloni Meat & 
Cheese Tray [sku 63390], and we've now built on that product's popularity with an everyday offering that we 
call Trader Joe's Prosciutto Wrapped Fresh Mozzarella Cheese. 

Aside from its obviously charming built-in 'handle,' this stick-shaped antipasto boasts some additional charms. 
For example, the cheese here is Fresh & silky, replacing the firm mozzarella that is most often used in similar 
rolled charcuterie. Also, that Fresh Mozzarella is Wrapped in imported, eleven-month aged Prosciutto, 
presenting a rich, flavorful bite. 

Whether you're entertaining a crowd, or simply craving quick cheese & charcuterie, our Prosciutto Wrapped

"083579","Classic Greek Salad","The traditional Greek salad is relatively new by ancient historical standards. It was apparently invented in the 
1960s when Athenian restauranteurs skirted a tariff on essential salad items by adding non-taxable feta cheese 
to an already popular plate of cucumber, olives, onion, bell peppers, and tomato. Tourists ate it up. Literally. 

Now, tourists of the culinary seas (aka our customers) have been eating up Trader Joe's Classic Greek Salad 
since 2005-which may not be ancient, but certainly makes this Salad 'classic' by our historical standards! And 
to this day, it remains a tried & true mix of fresh, Greek-inspired ingredients that harken back to the Athenian 
original. 

The base of romaine, with green & red cabbages, is complemented by wedges of cucumber, diced red bell 
pepper, julienned red onion, pitted kalamata olives, and-of course-feta cheese. A red wine vinaigrette-
including dehydrated garlic, and dried herbs (oregano, basil & parsley)-comes in a separate packet, ready to 
toss with this Salad whenever you're ready to eat it up; which could be today, or whenever you decide to swing 
by your neighborhood store to pick up a freshly packed, nine-ounce Trader Joe's Classic Greek Salad.

finished with a hearty portion of grilled salmon, which, when mixed all together with the included creamy

making sure that everyone has a chance to discover that pizza-even if you don't eat gluten. That's why we're 
expanding Trader Joe's Gluten Free Pizza Dough to be available in all of our stores, from coast to coast. Made

To enjoy your own homemade gluten free pizza, just let the dough sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes, 
then rub with olive oil (instead of wheat flour) so you can roll it out to about one-quarter inch thick. Then, top 
with whatever you like (our Sliced Uncured Pepperoni [sku 76905] and Shredded Mozzarella [sku 81085] are

starts with soft and tender chunks of potato, then mixes in diced celery and onion for some complementary 
crunch, and chopped, hard boiled eggs for a touch of richness, finishing with a dreamily creamy dressing that 
includes mayo, mustard, and just a touch of horseradish to round out its delicately tangy profile.

Our Potato Salad is ready to serve, right out of the tub, and makes an especially great partner to sweeter, 
spicier, or smokier flavors-like a hot link with caramelized onions, a rack of ribs glazed with Trader Joe's 
Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce [sku 63486], or a Brioche Bun [sku 67152] piled high with Hardwood 
Smoked Pulled Pork [sku 74968]. And in addition to being an excellent (and affordable) option for bringing 
along to a barbecue, it's also an excellent side for a quick and easy weekend lunch or weeknight dinner.

of course! 

Sous vide (literally ""under vacuum"" in French) is a cooking method that involves vacuum-sealing food, 
immersing the sealed package in water, and cooking it at a precisely controlled temperature for a very specific 
amount of time. This approach always yields a remarkably moist and tender result. And the boneless, skinless, 
all-white-meat Turkey Tenderloins in our package are no exception!

We've done the sous-viding for you, including a simple seasoning of sea salt, and garlic & onion powders. This 
means the Turkey Breast Tenderloins are ready to eat after only a quick warm-up in your skillet or microwave. 
It also means they're incredibly versatile, ready to be sauced, skewered, shredded-or served almost any way 
you fancy. Speaking of fancy, that's exactly how you're going to feel when you announce to your family in your

"077656","Strawberry Overnight Oats","When we introduced them to our refrigerators back in 2019, our Overnight Oats were an overnight sensation. 
Thanks to their simultaneously sweet and savory flavor, charmingly chewy texture, and satisfyingly filling 
nature, they've remained a perpetual hit among the busy breakfast set ever since. Now, just in time for spring, 
we've got a brand-new flavor for you to try oat: Trader Joe's Strawberry Overnight Oats! 

Like their predecessors, Trader Joe's Strawberry Overnight Oats start with only the finest of gluten free rolled 
oats. We soak said oats in a coconut beverage (water + coconut = coconut beverage), then blend them with 
strawberry purée, strawberry purée concentrate, and strawberry juice concentrate, plus a dash of salt for good 
measure. The end result makes for a sweet, simple meal-on-the-go, a hearty-in-a-hurry afternoon snack, and a 
tasty way to refuel after a workout. And while these Oats are, of course, great on their own, they also take well 
to customization-try adding a dollop of your favorite TJ's yogurt, some strawberry slices, and a handful of 
chocolate chips for extra flair.

"066015","Cauliflower Slims","As the years go on, we find ourselves returning to the same burning question, over and over: Truly, is there 
anything that cauliflower can't do? From pizza crusts, to rice, to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica 
boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. We 
recently found ourselves asking this question once again with the discovery of Trader Joe's Cauliflower Thins, 
an ingenious bread substitute made from sheets of shredded cauliflower baked together with egg, Parmesan 
cheese, and nutritional yeast. Take it from us: once you make a sandwich with cauliflower, you'll find yourself 
wondering if cauliflower's wonders ever cease, too.

Perfectly sized for a number of uses - including as a vehicle for avocado toast, a tortilla or pita, or even as 
a kind of savory, cheesy pancake, if you're so inclined - these Cauliflower Thins provide all the structure 
and texture of flatbread with a fraction of the carbs (only three grams of carbs per serving of two Thins, to 
be precise!). And since each Thin is made with Parmesan and nutritional yeast baked right in, every bite is 
filled with a nice, savory cheesy flavor that complements deli meats, condiments, and sauces wonderfully. At 
Trader Joe's, if there's one thing caulfilower won't do, it's cost you an arm and a leg: each 4.5-ounce package 
of Cauliflower Thins (each package containing four Thins) sells for $3.99*, every day. Look for them in our 
refrigerators, with our deli products.

"057824","Egg Salad","At Trader Joe's, one of our guiding values is that of kaizen. This philosophy of continuous, incremental 
improvement, popularized in mid-20th century Japan, doesn't just apply to the way we work, it also applies 
to the food we sell. For example, when our Egg Salad took a brief hiatus from our refrigerators, we took the 
opportunity to see how we could make it even more delicious. Now returning to our refrigerators with a new 
look and a new recipe, Trader Joe's Egg Salad might just be one the tastiest examples of kaizen in action you'll 
ever encounter.

Each batch is made with cage-free, hard cooked eggs, which are chopped and mixed with just the right amount 
of mayonnaise and tangy Dijon mustard to give it a light, yet creamy, consistency. We toss in some diced celery 
and green onions for good measure (and some added crunch), then add the finishing touches, like sea salt, 
parsley, white wine vinegar, and a pinch of black pepper. While Trader Joe's Egg Salad is certainly delightful 
on its own, it truly sings as part of an egg salad sandwich. We suggest using toasted slices of French Brioche 
[sku 56582] and adding soft, luscious leaves of Little Gem Lettuce [sku 76869]-or you can skip the bread and 
make egg salad lettuce wraps instead! And if you'd rather not commit to a whole meal, make yourself a snack by 
spooning this Salad onto some freshly toasted baguette slices and sprinkled with Smoked Paprika [sku 60290].

"074968","Hardwood Smoked Pulled Pork","In order to 'pull' meat, it must be cooked low & slow. This patient approach yields a fully cooked protein that 
is lean, tender, and extra flavorful. And being shredded, it's easy to pile on plates or stack on sandwich buns. 
Unfortunately, not everyone has the time & tools to make pulled meat themselves. That's why we created 
Trader Joe's Hardwood Smoked Pulled Pork. It possesses all the pleasures of pork you've smoked & pulled 
yourself-minus all the hours & effort!

To create this authentic Pulled Pork, our supplier seasons the meat with dehydrated garlic, onion powder, sea 
salt & white pepper-plus a special seasoning blend that includes light brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, 
and coffee. The seasoned Pork is then smoked in a small-batch rotisserie smoker, using actual hardwood logs 
(no wood chips, and no liquid smoke). Once cooked, it's shredded and packaged for Trader Joe's. 

When you open the package at home, you'll find a pouch inside that you can simply pierce and microwave on a 
dish for about three minutes. Or if you prefer, you can pour the contents of the pouch onto an oven-safe plate, 
cover with foil, add three tablespoons of water or sauce, and pop it in your conventional oven at 350°F for about 
20 minutes. Either way, you'll end up with savory, smoky, melt-in-your-mouth Pulled Pork that's ready in no

In just a matter of minutes in the microwave (or a little bit longer in a conventional oven), Trader Joe's Roasted 
Cauliflower and Orzo cooks to steamy, metly, savory perfection, and can be served as a side or as a particularly 
hearty entrée. Its mix of tender, creamy, and crunchy consistencies, along with its bold, savory flavors, make it

"060984","Veggies & Greens Salad Kit","A few words of explanation¿ At Trader Joe's, we're known for the clever, creative names we come up with 
for our products¿well, some of our products. We thought we'd take a moment to explain what we mean by 
""Veggies and Greens Salad Kit.""  ""Veggies"" is short for vegetables, and ""Greens"" is a common way to refer 
to different forms of lettuce, which are technically leaf vegetables. So, this could have been called ""Veggies 
and Veggies Salad Kit,"" but then we would lose the familiar comfort of using a colloquialism like ""greens."" 
We decided to go with ""Veggies and Greens Salad.""

Trader Joe's Veggies and Greens Salad Kit is a combination of chopped broccoli, shaved cauliflower, shaved 
Brussels sprouts, radicchio, green cabbage, and kale. Since this is a complete salad kit, these vegetables are ac-
companied by pistachios, dried pear crumbles, and a honey ginger dressing to create a salad that's expectedly 
healthy and delightfully delicious without being too self-righteous. 

Terrific on its own, or as a side dish, this Salad has Asian-influenced flavors that go well with all sorts of main 
entrées, like Garlic Peppercorn Pork Tenderloin [sku 90272], broiled chicken, or salmon. It's also a unique way 
to serve cruciferous veggies throughout their peak season.

You can find a 14-ounce Veggies and Greens Salad Kit in our Produce section throughout this Winter. Our

"076968","Roasted Hatch Chile & Jalapeño Cheese Dip","Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe's Roasted Hatch Chile & Jalapeño 
Cheese Dip? Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition 
of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and sensationally spicy appetizer Dip, and goes from there. 
Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of 
sour cream, cream cheese, and Cheddar, and flavored with fiery, roasted Hatch chiles and jalapeños, it heats 
up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your 
conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your 
favorite fresh veggies.

Available in our refrigerators for a limited time, this savory and superbly peppery Hatch Chile & Jalapeño 
Cheese Dip makes an easy hors d'oeuvres for a dinner party, and a great group snack when you've got folks 
over to watch the big game. With its tart, creamy, and cheesy base (courtesy of the sour cream, cream cheese, 
and Cheddar) and exhilarating-but not overwhelming-heat (thanks to its one-two punch of Hatch chile and 
jalapeño, naturally), it's especially apt for serving with something like a Kono Sauvingon Blanc [sku 94120], or

way to add a tasty veggie to a weeknight dinner, or get your meal prepping done for the week ahead. With 
their well-balanced blend of spicy and sweet, they're great companions to all kinds of savory proteins-we're

"072567","Avocado Ranch Salad Kit","When we set out to create one our all-in-one salad kits, sometimes it comes down to simply testing out a theory. 
For example: just on a conceptual level alone, the mild, lightly grassy flavor and remarkably creamy texture of 
avocado should make it a natural companion to the savory, herby sensations of a classic ranch dressing. We put 
that theory into practice with Trader Joe's Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, 
shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a 
canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados. As it turns out, 
that theory was delightfully, deliciously correct. Don't you just love the scientific method?

Like all our salad kits, this Avocado Ranch is a super quick and convenient way to add a side salad to practically 
any meal. It's a proven winner with pizza, a beauty with barbecue, and a certified sensation, even with something 
as simple as a sandwich. Or, if you'd prefer it as an entrée, just pop your favorite protein on top, an voilà-you've 
got a whole meal on your hands. We find it works especially well with our frozen Grilled Chicken Strips [sku 
75767], pan-seared salmon, or stir-fried, well-seasoned Organic 3-Grain Tempeh [sku 99125].

"076619","All Butter Sugar Cookie Dough","The reality of baking doesn't always line up with the cozy kitchen fantasy: ""Did I mix up the salt and sugar? Is 
that an eggshell? I have to do ALL of these dishes when I'm done?!""  Thankfully, Trader Joe's All Butter Sugar 
Cookie Dough can help you skip the second-guessing (and most of the dishes), so you can revel in the fantastic 
results of the baking (read: eat the cookies) that much faster. 

Made with a base of wheat flour, sugar, and butter-All Butter, in fact!- eggs are included to bind the Dough 
and lend it a pale yellow hue, while leavening ensures proper puffiness in every bake. Vanilla extract and a 
touch of sea salt round out the buttery, pleasantly sweet flavor of this delightful, All-Butter Dough, and it's 
packaged in a versatile tube shape, which allows for consistent sizing when slicing or portioning. Bake slices 
to your preferred texture (go with a shorter bake for soft & chewy, or longer for light & crisp) and enjoy their 
tasty, sugar-cookie-meets-shortbread simplicity as-is, or coat them in cinnamon and sugar before baking for 
an aromatic boost of sweetness. You might wrap a piece of Dough around a Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup 
[sku 94064] and bake for a sweet surprise, or roll it flat and break out the cookie cutters for an edible art project. 
(Pro-tip: for easier rolling, let the Dough sit 10-15 minutes at room temperature first.) You'll find this totally 
tubular, All Butter Sugar Cookie Dough at a fantastic value in the refrigerators at your neighbood Trader Joe's 
during baking season (that's September - December), while supplies last.

"077521","Spinach & Feta Egg White Burrito","Combining the heartiness and hand-hold-ability of a boldly-flavored breakfast burrito with the refreshing 
herbiness and savory sensations of a Meditteranean-style omelet, Trader Joe's Spinach & Feta Egg White Burrito 
is nothing short of a breakfast game-changer. Each one is made with a soft, whole wheat tortilla that's packed 
with fluffy egg whites, wilted spinach, and briny bits of feta cheese, along with a zesty, savory, sun-dried tomato 
spread. It's the kind of bold, breakfast mashup you'd find on the menu at a fancy brunch spot, with one key 
difference-it's available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's, and for a fraction of a typical brunch spot's price.

Not only is it a remarkable value, it's super convenient too: all it takes is a few minutes in the microwave, and 
you've got a phenomenally flavorful, herby and aromatic, on-the-go breakfast at the ready. Like any breakfast 
burrito worth its salt, it pairs wonderfully with all manner of hot sauces and salsas, like our Chunky Garlic & 
Jalapeño Hot Sauce [sku 74550]. That's hardly where we'd stop, though-we recommend trying our Spinach & 
Feta Egg White Burrito with creamy, Meditteranean-inspired condiments, too, like a dollop of Tzataziki [sku  
20405] or a spoonful of our Garlic Spread [sku 54173].

"077061","Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Tart","Though technically a ""winter squash,"" butternut squash is harvested in early fall, heralding the arrival of cool-
weather cooking and the rich, hearty flavors that accompany such pursuits. But if you're pressed for prep time, 
or just want to get cooking off your to-do list, you can still conjure the coziness of the season and satisfy your 
squashy desires with the help of Trader Joe's Butternut Squash and Caramelized Onion Tart. 

Like many good things, the base of this circular Tart starts with a flaky, buttery dough. Nestled inside is a 
creamy, cheesy filling commingled with savory Caramelized Onions that have been seasoned with fragrant 
sage and a touch of cayenne pepper. The edges of the dough are folded and pleated inward over the filling, 
leaving the center exposed to highlight the gem-like cubes of earthy Butternut Squash dotted throughout, 
and then the whole thng is baked to create a golden-brown crust. This rustic, freeform composition gives the 
Tart a homey, made-from-scratch vibe, but the only work required of you is overseeing a short stint in the 
oven to reheat and crisp up the crust. Measuring about seven inches in diameter, this Butternut Squash and 
Caramelized Onion Tart serves four guests (or two hungry ones), and when sliced and served, it's as at home 
on a dinner plate with a green salad as it is on a brunch buffet or appetizer platter.

"077488","Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip","Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe's Garlic & Asiago Cheese Dip? Perhaps 
one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, 
remarkably cheesy, and deeply, aromatically garlicky appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in 
mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream 
cheese, mozzarella, and Asiago, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the 
microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with 
tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.

Available in our refrigerators for a limited time, this phenomenally rich and savory Garlic & Asiago Cheese 
Dip makes an easy hors d'oeuvres for a dinner party, a sensational snack for when you've got a group over to 
watch the game, and a pitch-perfect pairing with a bottle of crisp white wine during a movie night. We find 
that its delicately tart tanginess (courtesy of the sour cream and cream cheese) and slightly nutty edge (thanks 
to the Asiago) make it especially apt for serving with something like our Growers Reserve Sauvingon Blanc [sku 
94120], or an easy-drinking blonde ale.

"076436","Kosher Dill Pickle Spears","You'd be hard-pressed to find a more perfect pairing with a sandwich than a crisp dill pickle. Sure, there 
have been contenders for the crown over the years, but with all respect to the soups and salads of the world, 
nothing quite complements a sandwich as well as the briny, herby flavor and juicy, satisfying crunch that 
only pickles can provide. And Trader Joe's Kosher Dill Pickle Spears, available now in our refrigerators, are 
particularly proficient at providing both of those crucial elements. Much of that is owed to the fact that our 
supplier cold-packs them in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp 
structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and 
even more resounding crunch at lunch.

Speaking of which, we're especially fond of packing these Dill Pickle Spears along as a side for work and school 
lunches, where they'll help cut through richer flavors, refresh the palate, and allow you to enjoy your meal even 
more. For that reason, we also find that they make a great addition to cheese plates and charcuterie boards. And 
for any fans of Chicago-style hot dogs, Pickle Spears like these are an essential inclusion.

"076439","Kosher Dill Pickle Chips","We're not saying that there's never a context in which a sandwich or burger can be considered complete without 
pickles. What we would venture to say, however, is that there's almost never a situation where pickles wouldn't 
improve a sandwich or burger. And Trader Joe's Kosher Dill Pickle Chips, available now in our refrigerators, 
are particularly suited for such improvement. Much of that is owed to the fact that, after our supplier slices 
them into perfectly sized, crinkle-cut rounds, they're cold-packed in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps 
them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results 
in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and an even more satisfying textural elemental for anything they're added to.

Speaking of which, in addition to topping burgers and sandwiches, these Dill Pickle Chips are awesome for 
layering on top of avocado toast, homemade foccacia, or, for the particularly adventurous, pizza. Beyond their 
uses as a topping, they're also great for mincing and mixing into appetizer dips, pastas, picnic salads, soups, 
quiches, and deviled eggs. And for a classic pub treat, try battering them, deep frying them until they're crispy, 
then serving with Everything and the Elote Greek Style Yogurt Dip [sku 70506].

"077316","Sesame Miso Salad with Salmon","We take a great deal of pride in our to-go salads here at Trader Joe's, and in the fact that so many of our 
customers enjoy them as a regular feature of their lunch breaks. If you ask us, it comes down to a very simple 
aspect of our salad-selecting philosophy: we only bring in the kinds of salads that we would want to eat on 
our lunch breaks, too. Trader Joe's Sesame Miso Salad with Salmon is a prime example of this philosophy in 
action. Inspired by the kinds of salmon-topped entrée salads you might find at a higher-end restaurant, each 
one starts with a blend of crisp, leafy greens like romaine, frisée, and baby spinach, to which our supplier adds 
shredded red cabbage and carrots, diced cucumbers, sliced green onions, and well-seasoned, flaky, grilled 
salmon. They also include a packet of crispy-fried onion pieces for a pop of texture, and a super flavorful 
sesame miso dressing to tie it all together.

Once tossed, this Sesame Miso Salad wth Salmon offers a captivating complex mix of textures and flavors, 
from the light, leafy elegance of the spring mix, to the tender richness of the salmon, and especially in the 
combination of umami, spice, and sweetness in the dressing. An excellent option for an easy lunch or dinner, 
we recommend enjoying this Salad with something sweet and fizzy, like a Sparkling Green Tea with Pineapple 
Juice Beverage [sku 70308]. And if you happen to enjoy it during dinner hours, a chilled glass of Mbali Chenin 
Viognier [sku 58887] will make an even more pleasant pairing.

"077429","Green Goddess Salad","People don't always think of Trader Joe's as a ""grab-n-go"" store, but perhaps they should. For those who 
have discovered our ready-to-eat salads, last-minute lunch is as easy as a quick trip to your neighborhood 
store. Made fresh every day, our salads come with a wide variety of veggies, proteins, dressings, and crunchy 
accoutrements. Trader Joe's Green Goddess Salad fits right into this section, with an attractive collection of 
textures & flavors. 

The colorful base is made up of shredded veggies, including romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage, and carrots. 
The Salad is protein-powered by Chicken Thigh Meat that's been seasoned with a blend of savory spices, then 
Blackened and cut into bite-sized pieces. When you're ready for lunch, simply open the included packet of 
crispy red rice and add it to the Salad for an impressive, crunchy contrast to the tender Chicken. Then add as 
much of the Green Goddess Ranch Dressing as you like. The blend of creamy buttermilk, champagne vinegar, 
tangy lemon, plus a host of herbs (parsley, basil, green onion, and chives), is a divine way to dress this Salad. 
And don't forget a squeeze of the fresh lime wedge that's included!

And if it's dinner time, you'll likely find that Trader Joe's Green Goddess Salad is substantial enough to fill you 
up... but if you're feeling famished, a side of TJ's Tomato & Parmesan Focaccia [sku 64435] from our ""grab-n-go"" 
bakery section will complement this Salad's profile, and ensure you're completely satisfied!

Egg Fettuccine Pasta","Not too long ago, pasta options for those avoiding gluten were grim, at best. These days, gluten free eaters can 
avail themselves of numerous options in our grocery aisle, from our Organic Brown Rice Penne [sku 64058] to 
our Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli  [sku 51524]. And now, with the introduction of Trader Joe's Gluten 
Free Egg Fettuccine Pasta, there's a refrigerated pasta option, too!

This Gluten Free Egg Fettuccine Pasta is crafted for us in a certified gluten free facility in Madison, Wisconsin. 
Our supplier makes these new-fangled noodles using old world techniques, including small-batch production 
on Italian equipment. They source California-grown brown rice and eggs from Iowa farms. Perhaps the most 
impressive thing about this Pasta is how it eats - we'll go so far as to say, if you didn't know it was gluten free, 
you'd never know it was gluten free. That's a testament to just how far gluten free pasta has come, and cause for 
rejoicing across the land.

Our Gluten Free Egg Fettuccine Pasta cooks in about 3-4 minutes (add some time to that for water boiling, of 
course). You can serve it simply, with olive oil, chopped basil, and Parmesan cheese. Add some diced tomatoes 
to brighten the flavor and color. Or go full-classic, pairing the Pasta with Trader Joe's Alfredo Sauce [sku 88617].

Our Lobster Bisque starts with a rich and aromatic base of lobster stock and cream, accentuated with

our refrigerators every fall since then, and now, twenty-five Pumpkin Seasons later, we bring you a gluten free 
alternative: our appropriately named Trader Joe's Gluten Free Pumpkin Ravioli!
  
This festive, fall Pumpkin Ravioli begins with tender, orange-hued pockets of gluten free pasta made from a 
blend of potato and tapioca starches. In the spirit of the season, we stuff said pasta pockets with a warm, hearty 
filling of pumpkin purée, kabocha squash, and a blend of ricotta, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses. We also 
(lightly) sweeten the deal with honey and brown sugar, then add a fleet of fall spices for flair-think cinnamon, 
nutmeg, allspice, and clove. The resulting Ravioli cooks up in just 2-3 minutes, making it an ideal, easy-to-

mean you won't need to do so much as break out a mixing bowl! These superbly soft and phenomally fluffy 
pre-made Omelets are fully cooked and ready to go, requiring as little as 20 seconds in the microwave or a 
skillet before the Cheddar inside becomes satisfyingly melty. No need to break any eggs, no need to break a 
sweat, no need to even break out a knife or fork, if you'd like-these Omelets can be enjoyed handheld and 
totally on the go!

Each package contains four deliciously cheesy Omelets, which each contain eight grams of protein, making 
them a smart breakfast option, in addition to an easy one. Plus, they can be quickly customized with your 
favorite fillings for something more substantial: add some diced bell pepper, onion, and Uncured Black Forest

cousin is called ravioletti.)

As its name would imply, Trader Joe's Italian Tomato & Burrata Ravioloni is made for us in Italy and double-

breadcrumbs, and a bit of basil paste. The pasta itself is delicate, toothsome, and two-toned-one side of each

"074770","Vegan Poke","""How, exactly, has Trader Joe's made a vegan version of a classically pescatarian dish like poke?"", you may be 
asking. The answer revolves around something of a textural magic trick. If you've never partaken of poke before, 
it's a traditional Hawaiian treat made with raw, cut-up fish, marinated in a variety of sauces and seasonings. As 
it turns out, roasted beets have a remarkably similar texture to sashimi-grade tuna, especially when marinated 
in a mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil-firm, yet delicate. So, that's how Trader Joe's Vegan Poke evokes the 
tender, toothsome texture and superbly saucy flavors of poke, while still maintaining an entirely plant-based 
ingredient deck.

Each batch of Trader Joe's Vegan Poke comes ready to eat, right out of the package, no heating required. In 
fact, we'd strongly suggest eating it chilled, as you would traditional poke. We also strongly suggest serving it 
over a bed of rice or mixed greens for an effortless entrée (we especially like it as a quick lunch option.) That 
said, it also makes a great side dish or appetizer ingredient, too-Vegan Poke nachos, anyone?

good reason. These Italian dumplings, usually made with potato, though sometimes with semolina flour, ricotta, 
or even cruciferous vegetables, are sublimely soft, delicately tender, comforting bites. It's no wonder we've 
expanded our assortment to our refrigerators, where you can find Trader Joe's Tri-Colored Mini Gnocchi. 

Made for us by the same supplier that makes our smashing, seasonal Pumpkin Gnocchi [sku 75290], both 
gnocchi begin with the same base ingredients-potato, wheat flour, and cornstarch. From there, this Gnocchi 
dough is divided into three and becomes Tri-Colored, thanks to the addition of tomato and spinach juice, 
natural food colorings that don't impart any flavor. The result is a combo of red, white, and green Gnocchi in 
each pack-the colors on the Italian flag.

In addition to the unique chromatic characteristics of these Gnocchi, they're also magnificently Mini-sized 
in comparison to most of the gnocchi you'll find in our stores, which means they cook up in just a couple of 
minutes. Boil and toss in your favorite sauce, and dinner is served! Or skip the boil and simply sauté in butter 
until browned and cooked through. They're super in soups and make a splendid stand-in for pasta when 
making mac and cheese, too. Yes, please!

"007904","Bruschetta Sauce","Trader Joe's  Bruschetta Sauce was first introduced way back in 1993, when bruschetta was still pretty much a 
novelty in culinary culture. Nearly a quarter of the way through the 21st century, bruschetta (broo-SKEH-tah) 
is as ubiquitous as white bread, and often just that flavorful. Our Bruschetta Sauce stood above the crowd then, 
and, now, in a much more crowded room it still stands high above the rest. 

It has that fresh-from-the-garden taste because its combination of chopped fresh tomatoes, oil, chopped basil, 
garlic and spices is never cooked. Their flavors do have the opportunity to marinate together, and the result is 
vibrant and versatile. Serve it on toasted baguette slices, toss it with hot or cold pasta, or spoon it on grilled or 
roasted chicken or fish.  However you choose to enjoy it, we guarantee enjoyment.  Every time.

"074768","Elote Chopped Salad Kit","You've put Mexican-style street corn in a salad kit, Trader Joe's? Well, not exactly. But our new Elote Chopped 
Salad Kit is packed with ingredients that evoke the flavors of this creamy, crunchy classic in every bite. Really.

It begins with a mixed veggie base that includes chopped green & red cabbage, green leaf lettuce, carrots, kale, 
green onion, and of course, crispy, dried, sweet corn kernels. We add cornbread crumbles, seasoned with 
smoked paprika, to add even more crunch and a little bit of heat; crumbled cotija cheese delivers creamy flavor 
and adds a soft texture to the mix. The real magic here lies in the creamy, elote-inspired dressing that's a little 
tart and a little sweet, with hints of jalapeño and lime. Tossed together, you won't think you're eating elote from 
a street vendor, but you will feel that same energy in every forkful of greens. Add your favorite protein (we like 
chicken or shrimp) and a sliced avocado to make this a complete meal. Grab a corn tortilla and heat it ever so 
slightly, then fill it with this satisfying mix-a taco to remember, for sure! If you're entertaining a crowd, spoon 
some into Elote Corn Chip Dippers [sku 60564] and serve as bite-sized appetizers.

"074256","4 Cheese Ravioli","We recently took a look at the fresh pasta section of our refrigerators, and couldn't help but notice that a pretty 
fundamental piece of the puzzle was missing: simple, traditional, classically cheesy ravioli. We immediately 
set to work with one of our Italian pasta suppliers to remedy this omission, and to say we were thrilled with 
what they came back with would be a tremendous understatement. Made with delicately thin pasta, wrapped 
around a luxuriously creamy filling comprised of four Italian cheeses, Trader Joe's 4 Cheese Ravioli have a 
mild, savory flavor, a satisfyingly tender texture, and, simply put, one of the best filling-to-pasta ratios we've 
ever encountered.

Like our other fresh ravioli options, Trader Joe's 4 Cheese Ravioli make a practically effortless entrée: after just 
a few minutes in salted, boiling water, they're ready to be drained and dressed with whatever sauces or toppings 
you prefer. We find that their cheesy flavor profile lends itself well to pairing with our Creamy Tomato Basil 
Pasta Sauce [sku 50776], or even something as simple as a quick drizzle of olive oil, and bit of shaved Parmesan, 
and a few shakes of crushed red pepper. In the mood for something a little more involved? Try using them in 
an Italian Sausage [sku 66728] and ravioli soup.

Trader Joe's Brussels Sprouts & Uncured Bacon Ravioli are stuffed with an awesomely autumnal filling of

pasta pockets a cozy, green hue. Like our other refrigerated ravioli, a package of Brussels Sprouts & Bacon 
Ravioli cooks up in under five minutes, making them a terrific answer to ""what's for dinner?"" when you're

always makes the most of its moment. Indeed, with its perfect mix of toothsome textures, savory flavors, and

to every bite. 

Fully cooked and ready to heat-and-serve, this Cornbread Stuffing makes holiday meal prepping a breeze: 
just a few minutes in a microwave (or a little longer in your conventional oven) are all that separate you and a 
steaming plate of satisfying stuffing. From there, you're free to pair it up with your favorite protein, accessorize 
it with cranberry sauce or gravy (or both!), or even  sneak it into a sandwich, if you're so inclined. Whether 
you're looking to lighten your workload this holiday season, in need of a dish for a holiday potluck, or are 
simply in the mood for something homey and delicious, this is the Stuffing that dreams are made of.

White Bean Chicken Chili Soup. Its chicken-soup base boasts a rich, brothy flavor and creamy character. 
Seasonings like garlic, chili powder, cilantro, cumin, oregano, cayenne, and lime juice add some southwestern 
style. Oh, and did we mention it's chock-full of white beans, corn, poblano peppers, and organic chicken 
breast-just like a chunky chili?

When you're craving soup, you'll want to heat up a bowl for a belly-warming lunch on a nippy, fall day. It'll 
only take 3-4 minutes in the microwave or 5-7 minutes on the stove top. If it's chili you're after, our White Bean 
Chicken Chili Soup can also accommodate. Spoon it over baked potatoes or scoop it up with our Organic 
Corn Chip Dippers [sku 92482]. You'll also find it's easily enhanced by common chili toppings, such as fresh

our favorite seasonal squash. Made with a mix of pumpkin purée, pumpkin spice, almond butter, and, of

autumn morning on a fun and festive note.

Ready to eat, right out of the fridge, these Pumpkin Overnight Oats make a great, quick breakfast for weekday 
mornings before school, a potently portable snack to bring along to the office, or even an effortless morning 
meal for camping trips. Its profile of savory pumpkin taste, accented by classically spicy notes of cinnamon 
and nutmeg, is more than enough to enjoy on its own, but it also takes particularly well to customization: try a

"056423","Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu","One of the greatest things about tofu, aside from its obvious health benefits, is its ability to absorb the flavors of 
the marinades and spices with which it's cooked. When you begin with naked tofu, marinate for a few hours, 
and then cook the tofu, it miraculously tastes just like the marinade. It's tofu's gift to chefs everywhere. Our gift 
to tofu-eaters everywhere is Trader Joe's Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu.

A recent addition to the baked tofu lineup, this Tofu is packed (and we mean packed) with 30 grams of protein in 
every seven ounce package. Using non-GMO sprouted soybeans, our supplier creates bean-curd by coagulating 
soy milk to yield soft, white curds. These curds are then pressed into firm tofu squares, which are subsequently 
marinated in spicy Sriracha for 12 hours and finally baked to perfectly textured, flavor-filled tofu. The long 
marinating process allows the tofu to absorb the sauce's fiery spiciness and it's subtle sweetness, along with a 
hint of garlic for an added depth of flavor. It also creates a red and white marbling that is as striking, as it is 
fiery-delicious.

Cut open the package and enjoy the Sriracha Flavored Baked Tofu just as it is-it's cooked and ready to enjoy. 
Try it with our Organic Herb Salad Mix [sku 50066]. Or, slice and stir-fry it with our Asian Stir Fry mix [sku 
81223], and then serve it with steamed Jasmine Rice [sku 52252] and perhaps a dash of¿ Sriracha [sku 50828]!

popcorn, to mustard, to falafel, our buyers have asked, ""Can we pickle that?"" and you, dear customers, 
have responded with a resounding ""Yes, you can!"" And so, in the spirit satisfying our customers' perpetual 
predilection for pickle, we're pushing the parameters of pickle season even further with the newest addition to 
our rotating lineup of chopped salads: Trader Joe's Dill-icious Chopped Salad Kit! 

This Kit has everything you need to create a Dill-icious dinner salad or positively pickle-y side dish, posthaste.

lettuce, and kale, buoyed by the dill-ightfully tangy crunch of our very own Chips In A Pickle Dill Flavored

"057099","Mango Jicama Slaw","If you've spent any time in Los Angeles, you are most likely familiar with the fruit cart vendors that colorfully 
dot the urban landscape. Serving up sliced, tropical fruit smothered in chili powder, salt, and lime juice, these 
beloved vendors are a must-visit for many Angelinos on a hot, sunny day-and there are many of those days 
in Los Angeles. Taking our cues from this traditional Mexican-American treat and from the fruit-based slaws 
you might see in a restaurant served alongside some grilled fish, we give you¿ Trader Joe's Mango Jicama 
Slaw. 

Pineapple is perhaps mango's most frequently seen sidekick, but since we like shaking things up a bit, we've 
swapped out the pineapple in our Slaw for the oft-overlooked, crisp wonder that is jicama-and we're pretty 
pleased with the results. The sweet, juiciness of the mango is pleasantly offset by the neutral, refreshing crunch 
of the jicama and green cabbage-and when you factor in the bits of cilantro and the tangy, spicy mango-lime 
vinaigrette, you've got nothing short of a fiesta in your mouth. 

Serve Trader Joe's Mango Jicama Slaw as a stand-alone side dish. Enjoy it alongside some grilled salmon or 
tilapia. Use it in your fish tacos next time you host Taco Tuesday at your place. Explore its place in sandwiches-
we happen to think it tastes mighty fine in hot sammie made with TJ's Pulled Pork [sku 93602]¿

We're selling each 12 ounce tub (enough to share¿ if you're good at sharing) of Trader Joe's Mango Jicama 
Slaw for $4.99-a small price to pay for flavors this bold, and worth every penny.

Each pack contains two tasty Egg Bites made with cage free eggs, cottage cheese, and butter to create a light and 
fluffy, almost soufflé-like texture, and which are flavored with creamy feta and leafy, savory-seasoned Spinach & 
Kale to create a marvelously Mediterranean-inspired flavor profile. They can easily be eaten while on the move, 
but also benefit from being savored with a cup of coffee or tea. They accessorize easily, too, be it with a dollop of 
sour cream or Greek yogurt, a dash of hot sauce, or our very own Crunchy Jalapeño Lime & Onion [sku 74473]

"073764","Egg Bites Cheddar Cheese & Uncured Bacon","All too often, grabbing a quick breakfast on the go can be a haphazard affair. But just because you're pressed 
for time, that doesn't mean your mornings have to be defined solely by barely-buttered toasts or hastily-mixed 
shakes. There's a better option-namely, Trader Joe's Cheddar Cheese & Uncured Bacon Egg Bites. These fully 
cooked, gluten free, scrumptiously savory breakfast treats only take a minute in the microwave (plus a minute to 
cool down) before they're ready to fuel your day in a decidedly delicious way.

Each pack contains two tasty Egg Bites made with cage free eggs, cottage cheese, and butter to create a light 
and fluffy, almost soufflé-like texture, and which are flavored with Cheddar Cheese and smoky Uncured Bacon 
to create a hearty, filling flavor profile. They can easily be eaten while on the move, but also benefit from being 
savored with a cup of coffee or tea. They accessorize easily, too, be it with a spoonful of your favorite hot sauce, 
salsa, or our very own Crunchy Chili Onion [sku 62480] and make an excellent breakfast sandwich when placed 
between two toasty English muffins.

"073314","BBQ & Black Pepper Toscano Chopped Salad","People often turn to salads for delicate flavors. But there's no rule that says a salad can't contain bold flavors. 
In fact, if there were such a rule, Trader Joe's BBQ & Black Pepper Toscano Chopped Salad would be the 
ultimate rule-breaker!

This is a complete salad kit, containing everything you need to construct a crisp, fresh-and particularly bold-
salad. The base includes green and red cabbages, combined with shredded carrots, broccoli, and kale. Such 
confident vegetable crunchiness is complemented by even more crunch, conveyed by cornbread croutons. The 
addition of aged, Black Pepper Toscano Cheese (packaged separately) brings another kind of boldness to this 
Salad-a rich and nutty flavor, with a touch of cracked black pepper heat. 

The final stroke of bold is delivered in the BBQ sweet onion dressing. Its molasses notes pair exceptionally well 
with the flavor of the Black Pepper Cheese, and the rest of the dressing profile (including mustard, white wine 
vinegar, onion, garlic, and chili powder) provides the finishing touch for this un-shy salad.

"071762","Gluten Free Cheese Ravioli","We'll rave about ravioli all day, if you let us. In fact, we've had a whole shelf dedicated to these effortless entrées 
in our refrigerators for as long as we can remember. But that doesn't mean that they can't be improved upon. 
For example, while we adore the tender, toothsome texture of a steamy, just-done raviolo, we recognize that 
they're not always easy for those who don't eat gluten to enjoy. Until today, that is. Trader Joe's Gluten Free 
Cheese Ravioli provide the same delightfully al dente bite and gloriously cheesy filling of traditional ravioli - 
they just also happen to not contain any gluten, too.

What's the secret? An ingenious mix of eggs, rice, corn, and cauliflower in the pasta dough. By combining the 
best aspects of these gluten free favorites, our supplier has created one of the truest-to-form gluten free pastas 
we've ever come across - we find that the inclusion of delicately nutty puréed cauliflower is what really sets it 
apart. Each of these Ravioli is filled with a creamy blend of ricotta, mozzarella, asiago, Parmesan, and Romano 
cheese, making it easy to pair with all kinds of sauces and seasonings. Try it tossed with pesto, marinara, 
Alfredo, or even just a bit of butter and your favorite suite of savory seasonings.

sweet flavors of the couscous and the currants are ideal partners for the lemon-y chicken and piquant arugula. 
We tie it all together by including a packet of spicy pimento dressing-add as much or as little as you like.  

In Morocco, you'd most likely eat a Trader Joe's Lemon Chicken & Arugula Salad with your fingers-it's polite

"073034","Cheeseburger Burrito","Most of us have enjoyed our fair share of cheeseburgers and burritos in our time, but chances are you've 
never enjoyed them in one singular eating experience. Well, Trader Joe's Cheeseburger Burrito is here to 
change all that! To create this momentous meeting of two casual culinary collossi, our supplier takes all the 
constituent ingredients of a juicy, fully-loaded cheeseburger, including savory-seasoned ground beef, sharp, 
shredded Cheddar cheese, chopped tomato & onion, and classic condiments like ketchup, mustard, and pickle 
relish, then wraps them tightly in a flour tortilla. Every bite is full-flavored, satisfying, and marvelously multi-
textured, setting a new standard for mealtime mash-ups.

Equally delicious as a weekend snack, school lunch, or late night treat, this Cheeseburger Burrito can be 
prepped in the microwave for a soft-textured tortilla, or heated in a conventional oven or skillet for a crispier 
exterior. It pairs especially well with burger stand standards like french fries or tots, and just like a typical 
burritom it can be customized with hot sauces, salsas, or even more melted cheese.

Made for us by a supplier in Italy who's been in the pasta business for over 140 years, each of these sunflower-
shaped Vegan Ravioli are made with egg-free semolina pasta, filled with a mix of hearty sautéed spinach, 
creamy cashew cheese, and just a sprinkling of breadcrumbs for a little extra oomph in each bite. After a brisk 
three to four minutes in boiling water, they take on a delightful al dente texture and can be served as simply 
(with a splash of olive oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper) or as sauce-fully (tossed with warm Vegan Kale,

version. You see, some years ago we came out with a similar product, and it was great. But recently, we realized 
we could make some changes that would make it even better. Many, many recipes and taste tests later, we 
present the new-and-improved Trader Joe's Italian Style Turkey Meatloaf.

We first take tender ground turkey and add a mixture of classic Italian seasonings to it, including garlic, onion, 
oregano, and basil. Breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper round out the recipe and 
make it ready for the oven. The individual meatloaves (that's a pretty fun plural noun, isn't it?) are formed by 
hand, baked, and then covered in a thick, flavorful tomato sauce. 

The deliciousness of this dish is unmatched, and the ease with which it'll be ready is life-altering. Really. Choose 
your desired preparation method-microwave or conventional oven-and you'll have dinnr done in no time. 
Turn this into the ultimate comfort meal by slicing and serving it alonside sautéed veggies, potatoes, or even

"073420","Egg Wraps","Recreating the feeling of a soft, warm tortilla or flatbread can be a difficult thing to do without gluten (trust us, 
we've tried a lot of variations in the Trader Joe's test kitchen), but fortunately for all of us, our expert suppliers 
are on the case! Their dedication to delicate, low-carb creperie has resulted in our latest innovation, Trader 
Joe's Egg Wraps. Using the power of eggs combined with a carefully balanced blend of gluten free flours, 
including brown rice flour, millet flour, and potato starch, each mildly savory Wrap provides all the structure, 
flexibility, and tender texture of a classic tortilla, and a scant fraction of the carbs - a 60-calorie serving of two 
Wraps will contain zero net carbs, in fact!

Use our Egg Wraps in any application you would a tortilla or flatbread: you can roll them with turkey and 
cheese and slice them for an effortless, classic appetizer, for instance. But aside from their obvious uses in 
burrito or wrap sandwich situations, we also find that our Egg Wraps' mild flavor and crepe-like qualities 
also extend them a great deal of utility as a dessert option. Try layering them with whipped cream or Coconut 
Whipped Topping [sku 58113] for an easy-to-construct cake, or applying a bit of Cocoa Almond Spread [sku

"065874","Cacio e Pepe Ravioli","Cacio e Pepe [say: kah-cheeoh eh peh-peh] is a deceptively simple Italian pasta dish that you may have seen on 
the menu the last time you visited a Rome-inspired restaurant. The name just means, ""cheese and pepper,"" and 
that pretty much sums it up. It is typically served on spaghetti, as it is in our frozen Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe [sku 
67549]. But now, we've delivered the flavor of this traditional sauce in an unexpected form: ravioli!

Trader Joe's Cacio e Pepe Ravioli is just what you'd imagine if you know the sauce. Our Italian supplier makes 
girasoli pasta (literally ""sunflower"" pasta) from durum wheat semolina and includes coarsely ground black 
pepper in the dough. They worked hard at finding the right grind-large enough to crunch, but not so coarse 
that it ripped through the rolled out dough. The sun-shaped pockets are filled with a creamy mixture that 
includes ricotta cheese, cream, and PDO Pecorino Romano. In fact, they whip these ingredients together to 
ensure a smooth and soft filling. The combination of the filling with the peppery pasta pillows creates a Cacio 
e Pepe experience, distinctly wrapped in ravioli. Find Trader Joe's Cacio e Pepe Ravioli every day in our 
refrigerators.

"058808","Tomato Feta Soup","An excellent bowl of soup should be comforting, warm (unless we're talking gazpacho), and full of flavor. Find-
ing-and making-super soups, especially year-round, can be a task, but it's a task we're eager to help you with. 
Especially when that help comes in the form of Trader Joe's Tomato Feta Soup. 

Though it diverges slightly from traditional tomato soup, our Tomato Feta Soup does so with flair. Vine rip-
ened tomatoes from California are slowly simmered until soft. Then, we add tomato paste, onions, light cream 
and spices, like sea salt, garlic, parsley, basil, bay leaves, and oregano. However, the preeminent ingredient in 
this soup is the feta, imported from Greece and crafted using age-old methods. It's crumbly, tangy, and you'll 
be able to see and taste pieces of it in this Soup. One spoonful and you'll never go back to the canned tomato 
soup of old.

As tasty as our Tomato Feta Soup is on its own, we would be remiss if we didn't suggest enjoying it with a 
grilled cheese. Try one made on Brioche Bread [sku 56582] with Sliced Provolone [sku 79684]-or go the classic 
route and use American Slices [sku 99183]. Some Oyster Crackers [sku 42049] are also never a bad idea.

find it in our refrigerated case.

one who is both nursing a winter cold and spunky enough to log stove-time making chicken soup from scratch. 
And that's when our sick-day hero, Trader Joe's Kettle Cooked Chicken Soup, enters the scene.  

Made for us in small batches, Trader Joe's Kettle Cooked Chicken Soup is made from scratch. Some would 
argue that the key to a great chicken soup is its base, and our supplier starts with the best: a rich chicken stock 
made from antibiotic-free chicken, fresh vegetables, herbs, and spices that has been slowly simmered to perfec-
tion, allowing the flavors to fully develop. Additional herbs are then steeped in the hot stock, and finally, chunks 
of chicken, carrots, celery, onions, and parsnips are stirred in to lend the soup the heartiness you crave on a 
blustery day.  

Serve Trader Joe's Kettle Cooked Chicken Soup alongside a toasted slice of your favorite, crusty TJ's Artisan 
Bread or a warm, melt-y panini. If you're truly feeling so under-the-weather that adding any accouterments 
sounds like too much work, serve this soup on its own. Heating up the whole tub will only keep you off the 
couch for 5 to 6 minutes, tops-how's that for homemade?  

We are selling each 32 ounce tub of Trader Joe's Kettle Cooked Chicken Soup for $5.99-which is a steal com-
pared to other fresh, antibiotic-free chicken soups we've seen on the market. It's chicken soup for the soul and 
for the pocket book¿

easily attainable, it's practically effortless in preparation. Indeed, Trader Joe's Spinach Tortellini take only two 
or three minutes of cooking in boiling water before they're al dente and ready to eat. Inside each artfully folded 
Tortellino, our supplier has stuffed a flavorful mix of spinach, ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan-so flavorful, 
in fact, that once they're done cooking, all they need is a quick drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of Parmesan 
before they're ready to serve. 

While they're ideal for quick, easy dinner situations, their ease of use also comes in handy for slightly more 
complex recipes. Try using them as the basis for a hearty, picnic-ready, cold pasta salad with pleny of artichoke 
hearts and juicy olives. Or, if you're looking for something to warm you up, they work wonders in a steamy, 
creamy soup with crumbled Italian sausage.

"038956","Greek Olive Medley","Olives have been cultivated in Greece for thousands of years.  They're mentioned in both the Odyssey and 
the Iliad and in literary works throughout the ages.  Today, Greece remains one of the world's largest olive 
producers - the climate, terrain, and expertise of Greek farmers result in some of our very favorite olives.  
We've combined several of them into Trader Joe's Greek Olive Medley, an ideal companion to a holiday 
cheese tray or antipasto platter.

The olives we feature in our Greek Olive Medley (Kalamata, Black & Blonde Mt. Pelion, Green Mt. Athos, & 
Nafplion) are grown in small Aegean villages where they are hand picked at the peak of ripeness and cured in 
a brine of red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, bay leaves and oregano.  This brightly flavored brine brings out the 
best of the olives' rich, delicious flavors, heightening their vibrant flavors and allowing them to maintain their 
good texture.

We're selling this Medley for the melodious price of $3.99* for each 10 ounce (drained weight) tub.  This is an

"063625","Brussels Sprouts Sauté Kit","It can seem like quite a complicated dance, putting a whole dinner together. In fact, dance is actually where we 
get the culinary term ""sauté"": in ballet, to sauté refers to jumping, or incorporating any kind of jump into a dance 
step. In the French cooking tradition, chefs noticed the similarity between items ""jumping"" in a hot pan with 
oil to the choreographed jumps of ballerinas, and the term stuck (though, hopefully, whatever was in the pan 
didn't). Luckily, cooking doesn't always have to require as much coordination as a pas de deux, especially when 
you've got Trader Joe's Brussels Sprouts Sauté Kit as your partner.

Prepped and ready for immediate cooking, each Brussels Sprouts Sauté Kit comes with four primary ingredi-
ents: shaved Brussels sprouts, shaved Parmesan cheese, roughly chopped hazelnuts, and a creamy lemon garlic 
vinaigrette. All one needs to do to turn these into a delicious, hearty side for any dinner is follow three simple 
steps (with no need to stretch beforehand, either): first, lightly toast the hazelnuts in a pan, then set aside. Next, 
sauté the Brussels sprouts in a little olive oil over medium heat until warm and tender (about three minutes). 
Then, mix in the vinaigrette and continue to cook until temptingly fragrant (another two minutes or so), garnish 
with the Parmesan and hazelnuts, et voilà. You now have a side ready to roll.

While this Kit is designed with ease in mind, it's not just for those who have two left feet, kitchen-wise. Anyone 
who loves warm, tender Brussels sprouts with a delicious lemon kick will be dancing with joy when this scrump-
tious side gets served - particularly when paired with a flavorful protein. Our Bacon-Wrapped Porchetta Pork 
Roast [sku 55559] is an especially good choice, as the nuttiness and citric edge go right in step with the smoky 
savoriness of pork. 

Trader Joe's Brussels Sprouts Sauté Kit makes prepping a side as graceful as can be. But keep on your toes - 
we're only selling 13 ounce bags for $4.49 through the winter. After that, dear friends, it shall sashay away.

"050199","Honey Roasted Pumpkin Ravioli","Though the history of what we call ravioli dates back to sometime in the 14th century in the region now iden-
tified as Italy, every food culture has its own variation on the dumpling, and some are traceable as far back as 
the 10th century. Twelve percent of the way into the 21st century, Trader Joe's made its mark on ravioli history 
when we introduced Trader Joe's Honey Roasted Pumpkin Ravioli. Since then, this tradition-smashing pump-
kin treat has returned each year in celebration of our very own tradition, Pumpkin Season.

The filling is a harmonious medley of pumpkin perfection-sweet pumpkin is slathered with honey and a bit of 
brown sugar and molasses, then roasted, pureed, and blended with ricotta and mozzarella cheeses. This sweet-
savory mixture is stuffed into colorful, square pasta-one side is orange-red like a pumpkin shell, the other side 
a more muted orange, like the inside of the pumpkin. 

Just chewy enough on the outside, smooth & rich on the inside, Honey Roasted Pumpkin Ravioli are flavorful 
enough that they need very little saucy embellishment. If you feel you must add, you might adorn them with 
our Autumnal Harvest Pasta Sauce [sku 55269]. We also like them with just a bit of butter (melted and browned 
a bit if you have the inclination) or extra virgin olive oil. 

We're selling each nine-ounce package for $3.49, the same price they've been since we introduced them back in 
aught-12.

"060956","Pumpkin Butternut Squash Bisque","On a chilly fall day, nothing's quite as comforting as a huge bowl of warm soup. Now, what if we told you we had 
something almost exactly like soup, but seasonally flavored and given an especially fancy name? Trader Joe's 
Pumpkin Butternut Squash Bisque is just this product, and you won't be disappointed.

Our Pumpkin Bisque is no ordinary pumpkin soup; this is why we decided to call it Pumpkin Bisque instead 
of pumpkin soup. In addition to pumpkin purée, we've added butternut squash, onions, carrots, honey, brown 
butter and fresh sage leaves for a decidedly unique taste. These ingredients (along with some spices like salt, 
garlic, nutmeg, and black pepper) are combined in kettles and slowly cooked until a deep, rich flavor forms. 

The ideal way to serve Pumpkin Bisque is, of course, in a miniature pumpkin-like our Pumpkin Pie Pump-
kins [sku 47003]. If you don't have a miniature pumpkin on hand, you can also serve it in a bowl, the typical 
soup-serving dish. Top it with Cheese & Garlic Croutons [sku 43355] or a few fresh sage leaves. Serve alongside 
a sandwich made with Thanksgiving leftovers, or a classic grilled cheese-pumpkin soup seems to be a fitting 
holiday alternative to the typical tomato. 

We're selling each 20-ounce container of Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butternut Squash Bisque for $3.99 through-
out the season for soups.

"070670","Vegan Ranch Crunch Salad Kit","Our customers love their Salad Kits (or, rather, our Salad Kits), and Trader Joe's Vegan Ranch Crunch Salad 
Kit promises to be no exception. Not only is it fresh, crunchy, and tasty¿ but it's also vegan! Some of our salad 
kits that aren't vegan can certainly be made vegan if you hold the provided packets of dressing (and cheese, in 
some kits), but in this case, drizzle away, because the herbaceous, creamy Ranch is soy-based, not milk-based!

Ranch might be the star flavor profile in our Vegan Ranch Crunch Salad Kit  (makes sense), but a packet of ranch 
dressing is just a package of ranch dressing without a salad. Fortunately for you, this Kit comes with everything 
you need to make the full monty: red & green cabbage, romaine lettuce, kale, crispy fried onions, roasted sunflower

"058463","Southwestern Chopped Salad Kit","Deserts, cacti, cowboys, and the Grand Canyon are all emblematic of the southwestern United States. Another 
distinguishing feature? The food. And we do love food. The fare you'll often find in this corner of the country is 
Mexican food with a twist: spicy, vibrant, and tasty. We've taken these familiar flavors and reimagined them as 
a salad. Trader Joe's Southwestern Chopped Salad, to be exact.

Our Southwestern Chopped Salad is an homage to the bright, spicy, flavorful dishes of its namesake region-
and it's a complete salad kit, so everything you need is right in the bag! Green cabbage, carrots, and radish 
have been chopped into small pieces and then mixed with romaine lettuce-and just the right amount of green 
onions and cilantro. Also included in the bag are pepitas, tortilla strips, cotija cheese, and a spicy avocado 
dressing-which gets its spiciness from poblano chiles. Simply put all ingredients in a bowl, toss, and enjoy the 
crunchy, delicious result.

This Southwestern Salad is perfect as a side salad with a dinner of Chicken Verde Enchiladas [sku 58292]. Grill 
up Carne Asada [sku 75977] or Pollo Asado [sku 81293] and place on top for some added protein. Or, toss it 
up and have a bowl for lunch-and save the rest for later! And we always advise adding some fresh slices of 
avocado.

We're selling each 13.6-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Southwestern Chopped Salad for $2.99 (WC, TX) or $3.29 
(EC, MW, SE). You'll find it with our other bagged salads.

the barbie¿ but as much as backyard BBQs are about the meats, they're also about the sides-and coleslaw is 
compulsory! Accordingly, Trader Joe's has created an Organic Coleslaw Kit including all you need to whip up 
a fresh, classic salad that has surprisingly many uses beyond being just a BBQ side dish.

Our Organic Coleslaw is a mix of chopped organic green cabbage, chopped organic red cabbage, and shredded 
carrots. This fresh, crisp base is triple-washed and ready to be tossed with our organic dressing (included and 
packaged separately). It's a classic slaw dressing that's creamy and slightly sweet-made with organic expeller 
pressed soybean oil and organic cider vinegar. Organic egg yolks contribute creaminess, while garlic, dehydrated 
onion, sea salt and black pepper bring a savory factor. Some organic cane sugar and organic lemon juice add 
just the right amount of sweet/tangy balance.

Mix it up in a minute, then scoop it next to your grilled Spatchcocked Lemon Rosemary Chicken [sku 56660]. 
Sidle it up to our All Natural Crate Free Pork Loin Baby Back Ribs [sku 63397] brushed with plenty of TJ's 
Organic Kansas City Style BBQ Sauce [sku 63486]. Replace the sauerkraut on your Reuben sandwich to make a 
""Rachel."" Our Organic Coleslaw is ideal for fish tacos and also makes a great sub for lettuce on grilled burgers.

"070309","A Za'atar Tango Salad Kit","Trader Joe's Complete Salad Kits provide a great opportunity to explore the flavors of regional cuisines, from 
Thailand, to the Southwestern United States, to Greece. A Za'atar Tango Salad Kit finds its inspiration in the 
cuisine of the eastern-most Mediterranean region.

Tender, curly, red & green oak lettuces form the base, along with baby green tango, with its frilly leaves and 
longer stems that are ideal for catching and delivering salad toppings. And this Kit's toppings really bring the 
flavors! A separate packet includes sweetened diced dates, toasted sesame seeds, and salted pistachio pieces. It 
also contains flatbread strips that have been amped up with a zingy za'atar seasoning that incorporates parsley, 
thyme, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon oil, sesame oil, cumin oil, and rice hulls for some extra crunch.

All these elements benefit from some balance, which is where the cucumber yogurt dressing comes in. It's 
creamy, cool, and an excellent complement for the savory flavors and crunchy textures. You can find the 
9.25-ounce A Za'atar Tango Salad Kit in that region of our store we like to call ""the refrigerated produce case.""

"071055","Vegan Enchilada Casserole","Here at Trader Joe's, our buyers have quietly been on a quest to bring more vegan variations of normally 
non-vegan foods to our shelves. We do this not just to make more plant-based options available to our vegan 
customers (although that's certainly part of it), but to showcase how delicious these dishes can be to non-
vegans, too. With Trader Joe's Vegan Enchilada Casserole, for instance, we've simply put a vegan spin on the 
hearty, filling comforts of a homey, weeknight dinner classic, such that it can be enjoyed by carnivores and 
vegans alike. And believe us, there's a whole lot to enjoy in this melty, saucy, multi-layered meal.

Inside each 20-ounce package of Trader Joe's Vegan Enchilada Casserole, our supplier has stacked layer upon 
layer of soft corn tortillas with a medley of roasted veggies including yams, zucchini, onions, and zesty poblano 
peppers. They then smother them all in a toasty red chile sauce and top it off with a mix of mozzarella and 
cheddar-style shredded vegan cheese. Once cooked (either for a few minutes in the microwave, or a little longer 
in a conventional oven), this savory, stratified Casserole turns gloriously gooey and satisfying, especially when 
enhanced by your favorite fiery hot sauce or a nice application of our very own Salsa Autentica [sku 01535].

"060047","Mexican Style Corn & Quinoa Salad","Elote is a Mexican street food marvel that consists of a grilled corncob slathered in mayonnaise and covered in 
cotija cheese. We know, incredible. Then, there's esquites. This is the easier-to-eat, less-messy version of elote, 
where the corn is cut off the cob, put into a cup, and mixed with the aforementioned mayo & cotija. Again, deli-
cious. Now, there's Trader Joe's Mexican Style Corn & Quinoa Salad. It's our own esquites-meets-filling grain 
salad that has all the wonderful attributes of its two inspirational dishes-plus more!

This wouldn't be Mexican Style Corn & Quinoa Salad if it didn't contain a healthy amount of Mexican style 
corn. But we go beyond the corn here. Brightly colored layers of grape tomatoes, kale, red & green cabbage, 
and a mixture of white quinoa and brown rice accompany the corn. It's made complete by a fresh lime wedge 
and a packet of roasted poblano cilantro dressing that recreates the delicious crema you'd find on elote and 
esquites. When all contents are emptied into a bowl and mixed together, you've got a salad that's sweet, fresh, 
and flavorful.

You'll find this Salad makes for a deliciously filling vegetarian lunch. Add grilled chicken or shrimp if you're 
looking for extra protein. It's the ideal side dish to accompany any number of Mexican entrées: Rojo or Verde 
Enchiladas [skus 58698/58292], Chicken Taquitos [sku 79545], Black Bean & Cheese Burritos [sku 38767], or

"053425","Ricotta & Lemon Zest Ravioli","During summer, the Italian countryside is blanketed in gold by fields of girasole (GEE-rah-so-LAY), known 
in English as sunflowers. The eponymous ravioli is cut to resemble the daisy-like flower heads. One might say, 
then, that Girasoli is the pasta of summer. 

We thought a summer pasta sounded sensational and wanted our Girasloli to capture the radiance and 
warmth of its namesake. We turned to our revered Italian pasta makers for a recipe. Committed to preserving 
regional culinary traditions, they presented us with a fine Ricotta & Lemon Zest Pasta in the style of  Sicily, 
using real Sicilian lemons.

It starts with classic, fresh, Italian pasta, made with only three ingredients: soft wheat flour, durum wheat 
semolina and egg. Tender and rich, the pasta glows golden, courtesy of the egg. Rolled thin and custom cut to 
resemble a sunflower, it is then filled with fresh ricotta, naturally creamy and slightly sweet, that is mixed with 
lemon zest and balanced with butter, bread crumbs and salt. The bite captures a sunny, summer day in Sicily. 
 
While all of the elements are essential, the lemons paint the picture. Grown in the volcanic soil around Mount 
Etna, the authentic Sicilian lemons have a bright acidity and distinct sweetness. Their zest gives a clean taste to 
the ricotta and bright character to the Girasoli.

We think Trader Giotto's Girasoli Ricotta & Lemon Zest is best sauced lightly - with a drizzle of extra virgin 
olive oil and fresh chopped basil. Pair it with an arugula salad and a crisp glass of Mezzacorona Pinot Grigio 
[sku 00314] for a romantic meal. It is a radiant summer offering at $2.99 for 8.8 ounce package.

"070961","Cauliflower Pizza Crusts","As the years go on, we find ourselves returning to the same burning question, over and over: Truly, is there 
anything that cauliflower can't do? From pizza crusts, to ""rice,"" to dense, doughy pastas, this brilliant brassica 
boldly goes into territories normally dominated by carbs and bread, where veggies normally fear to tread. 
Trader Joe's Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are another way to prove this theorem, following in the footsteps of 
other products that came before, such as our Cauliflower Thins [sku 66015].

Like Cauliflower Thins, our Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are made of similar ingredients (by the same supplier, in 
fact). They use shredded cauliflower, whole eggs, and grated Parmesan to create a cohesive ""dough"" that holds 
together to form a flatbread-like round. Unlike the Thins, however, these Pizza Crusts are twice as large-8 
inches vs. 4 inches-and lightly seasoned with garlic and herbs, including basil and oregano.

Based on the name, you could correctly infer that these are excellent topped with some kind of sauce, cheese, 
and other toppings and baked in the oven for a gluten free pizza experience. And being larger than the Thins, 
Cauliflower Pizza Crusts are also great as sandwich wraps; as gluten free tortilla stand-ins; or for other 
occasions that would normally call for actual bread!

girasoli, triangoli, tortellini¿ Though our newest, seasonal offering is the recognizable ravioli shape, Trader 
Joe's Sweet Corn, Burrata, and Basil Ravioli exceeds all expectations with its bright, seasonal tastiness. 

Though the name of this product aptly describes this exclusive-to-TJ's Ravioli's filling, it doesn't do full justice 
to the flavorful, quality ingredients that go into this product. Whole kernels of sweet corn, fresh leaves of basil,

crumbs to round it out. Yellow stripes, created naturally using turmeric powder, adorn the ravioli pieces, giving 
you a colorful glimpse of the delightfulness you'll find inside these pasta pockets.

To prepare, simply place our Sweet Corn Ravioli in boiling water, reduce to a simmer, and cook for five to six 
minutes. A drizzle of your favorite olive oil, like TJ's Spanish Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 98485], and a sprinkling 
of TJ's Shaved Parmesan [sku 83140] provide the perfect pairing-it's ideal for fully savoring the flavors of this

"061302","Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad","As traders on the culinary seas, we often find our inspiration for new products while traveling and exploring 
international cuisines. The Mediterranean region, with its bright blue waters, white-washed buildings, and idyl-
lic weather, is a place bursting with wonderful food, and one that frequently inspires our innovation. Ironically, 
the idea for Trader Joe's Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad did not come from such a voyage, but from a 
family recipe right under our noses...

What started out as ""Carmen's Famous Orzo Salad,"" a side served at family gatherings and potlucks, eventually 
found its way to our tasting panel. The verdict was the same as every other time it had been tried: WOW. Our 
Mediterranean Style Orzo Pasta Salad, like Carmen's, starts with a pasta salad made up of orzo, crumbled feta 
cheese, diced red onion, Kalamata olives, and sun dried tomatoes. It's then tossed in a golden balsamic dress-
ing and basil pesto and topped with shredded spinach-yes, a pasta salad that actually has some ""salad""! The 
spinach-on-top layering ensures fresh leaves when it comes time to enjoy. Its savory and salty flavors perfectly 
evoke its regional namesake-it'll be almost as if you traveled there! 

Such a delicious Orzo Pasta Salad has so many moments to shine. Bring a few containers to that last-minute 
BBQ your neighbor is throwing, or enjoy it with grilled fish for a tasty lunch. Even better, turn it into the per-

"061353","Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit","In 2015, we released our very first complete salad kit that wasn't actually a ""salad."" Our Broccoli & Kale Slaw Kit 
[sku 55386] is, well, slaw (in the general sense of the word). And it's been a hit ever since. Trader Joe's Tahini, 
Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit is our next foray into slaw kits, and it's a slaw kit that truly takes slaw kits to the next 
level.

This recipe was dreamed up by one of our Buyers, who wanted to introduce a unique flavor profile to our se-
lection of complete salad kits. A blend of shredded rainbow carrots, broccoli stalks, green cabbage, and kale 
comprises the ""slaw"" part of this Slaw. But it's the good stuff-the ingredients from which the Slaw got its 
name-that take this from an ordinary slaw into something profoundly delicious. Pepitas, chopped sun-dried 
apricots, and a creamy tahini orange dressing make this truly one-of-a-kind.

Such a vibrant Slaw Kit allows for quick-and tasty-weekday meal prep. It's as easy as adding a piece of grilled 
salmon, Grilled Chicken Strips [sku 64873], or Falafel [sku 93935]. Serve it as a side dish to a larger meal, or toss 
a crunchy addition into sandwiches, wraps, or tacos.

Yes, Trader Joe's Tahini, Pepita & Apricot Slaw Kit is innovative; and, yes, Trader Joe's Tahini, Pepita & 
Apricot Slaw Kit is a value. Innovation and value are two of our favorite things, after all. You'll find each 
14.25-ounce bag for $3.99, available for a limited time.

"061855","Organic Caesar Salad Kit","You may be familiar with Caesar Salad's origin story; back in 1924, or so the story goes, chef Caesar Cardini was 
about to close his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico for the night when a hungry customer asked for a salad. Nearly 
out of ingredients, Caesar whipped together what he had, and the now-classic Caesar Salad was born. As we 
quickly approach the Caesar Salad's 100th anniversary (where has the time gone?), the question is raised: how 
does one properly render tribute to such a sovereign of salads? How does one hail such a monarch of mixed 
greens? We came, we saw, we stepped up our game with Trader Joe's Organic Caesar Salad Kit.

It's the classic crunchy, creamy, garlicky, and (most importantly) delicious Caesar Salad you know and love, ex-
cept this time, it's all organic. In other words, each bag contains crisp, fresh-chopped leaves of organic Roamine 
lettuce, tasty shreds of organic parmesan cheese, splendidly seasoned organic croutons, and a rich, peppery 
salad dressing made entirely with organic ingredients. All you have to do is make like chef Caesar and mix them 
all together, and your conquest of dinner is complete.

Like a certain other Caesar we can think of, you may be surprised at just how protean this salad can be-no 
need to confine it to just a side. Simply add some grilled steak, chicken, or shrimp, and you have a full-fledged 
entrée. Or, if you're feeling a little more adventurous, using this Caesar Salad as a basis for a flavorful wrap or 
as the topping to a turkey or salmon burger can turn a plebian sandwich experience into a full-fledged triumph. 
No matter how you use it, it's a value that even an emperor could appreciate: we're selling each 12 oz. bag for 
only $3.99, every day. You'll find them in the refrigerated case, with our other bagged salads.

"062016","Organic Mediterranean Style Salad Kit","With colorful ingredients, a rustic mélange of textures, and bright, fresh flavors, Trader Joe's Organic 
Mediterranean Style Salad Kit is the ne plus ultra of summery salads. Cool romaine lettuce, shredded broccoli 
stalks and crisp radicchio form the sturdy base of this Salad, while celery, seasoned flatbread strips, and roasted 
chickpeas add major crunch. This collection of cool, crisp, and crunchy components is rounded out with tender 
dried tomatoes and crumbled feta cheese, and made complete with a packet of dressing that's fantastic in its 
own right: herby notes of basil and oregano and savory garlic, all swimming in a blend of extra virgin olive oil 
and tangy red wine vinegar. And did we mention this complete Salad Kit is completely organic?

A veritable summer vacation in a bag, just toss this Organic Salad Kit with diced organic chicken and fluffy 
couscous-it's easy to imagine sailing the blue-green waters of the Aegean with each crunchy, refreshing bite. 
We're offering 12.95 ounce bags of Trader Joe's Organic Mediterranean Style Salad Kit for $3.99 each. At a 
dollar less than retails we've seen elsewhere, it's an incredible value on organic produce that you'll only find at 
your neighborhood Trader Joe's.

"067489","Peanut Udon Noodle Salad","If you know udon (those hearty, Japanese, wheat-flour noodles), you probably know udon in the context of 
soup. Trader Joe's Peanut Udon Noodle Salad brings this pasta to a chilled application-one that is rich with 
texture and flavor.

Authentic udon noodles made with organic wheat flour are boiled and drained then mixed with fresh carrot 
'matchsticks.' The soft vs. crisp contrast is crave-able and emphasized with the addition of green and red cabbage, 
red bell peppers, and dry roasted peanuts. These mild, fresh veggies are paired with the more aromatic flavors 
of diced green onion and cilantro. Ultimately, it's the peanut-ginger dressing that Thai-s it all together. Peanut 
butter, soy sauce and rice vinegar make up the dressing base, enhanced by the likes of ginger puree, lemon 
grass, garlic, lime juice, dried red chili peppers, basil, ground Thai lime leaf, spearmint, and cayenne pepper.

Find the 11.75-ounce container of Peanut Udon Noodle Salad in our refrigerated section.

"061771","Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito","It's a not-exactly-demonstrable but nonetheless probably-true fact that burritos are one of the tastiest, handi-
est food creations. Take, for instance, our oh-so-popular Black Bean and Jack Cheese Burrito [sku 38767]: the 
tortilla perfectly hugs the beans and cheese, keeping them safe until you're ready to enjoy. Now, when you use 
breakfast ingredients instead of beans and cheese, it's a real game-changer (or breakfast-changer). 

Our Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito aptly contains all the important breakfast ingredients 
necessary to deem this breakfast-worthy. We went after tradition: chicken sausage flavored with sage and 
thyme, scrambled eggs, potatoes, sautéed onions, and white cheddar cheese live inside a chewy flour tortilla. 
The proportions are just right, so you'll get a little bit of everything in each bite. And, though it is a Breakfast 
Burrito, you don't have to restrict the time of day in which you enjoy it-it's always delicious.

Maybe the best part about this Breakfast Burrito (after the Burrito itself, of course) is the endless condiment 
possibilities that lay before you. Do you like Ketchup [sku 55860] to accompany your breakfast? If you're from 
the southwest, you're probably reaching for the Salsa Autentica [sku 01535] the second you hear ""breakfast."" 
Or maybe you like a spicier version, a lá Ghost Pepper Habanero Salsa [sku 59417]. Then there's Sriracha [sku 
50828], Green Dragon [sku 54861], Avocado's Number Guacamole [sku 65355], Harissa [sku 55841]¿

As far as burritos go, Trader Joe's Chicken Sausage Breakfast Burrito lives up to the ""tastiest, handiest food 
creation"" designation, and it's got a value to match. Each eight-ounce Burrito is $3.99, every day. You'll find it 
with our other fresh burritos.

"058304","Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup","Who doesn't love soup? Especially when winter is howling, much like it is now. A piping hot bowl of fresh, 
hearty soup will warm you on the inside when it's cold outside. So grab a tub of Trader Joe's Organic Hearty 
Minestrone Soup, heat it up, insert a spoon, and feel the warmth.

This isn't just any old soup. It's a next-best-thing-to-homemade soup. The stock is made from scratch. The 
veggies are fresh. It's cooked in small batches. And each ingredient is added to the pot at exactly the right time. 
This is important, because when making soups, the success of the finished product is all about layering the 
flavors-and this takes time. Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup is teeming with organic veggies-like carrots, 
tomatoes, peas, and chopped kale-in a tomato-based broth, plus a bounty of kidney and cannellini beans, 
plenty of orzo, and copious amounts of herbs and spices. 

We've offered fresh Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup in winters past, but this year, we've kaizened it to new 
hygge heights. First of all, we've made it vegan. The only ingredient making our previous incarnation not vegan 
was beef broth, and as soon as we realized that we could swap the beef broth for veggie broth and get equally 
rich results, we were happy to do so. Because soup is for everyone. Second, we're using an even tastier, rice-and-
quinoa-based orzo this year. It's got great bite, and it doesn't compromise the soup's gluten-free status.

Trader Joe's Organic Hearty Minestrone Soup comes in a 20-ounce tub that will serve two, and we're selling 
each tub for $3.99, every day while the season lasts. You'll find it in our refrigerated case.

"066094","Peanut and Crispy Noodle Salad Kit","One of our favorite aspects of Thai cuisine, and pad thai in particular, is the meticulous, dare-we-say symphonic 
balance of flavors. In a great Thai dish, you'll find sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and umami, combining into one truly 
fantastic feast for the senses. And it's precisely this elegant interplay of flavors that inspired our latest DIY 
bagged salad, Trader Joe's Peanut and Crispy Noodle Salad Kit.

Each bag includes a hearty base of fresh, captivatingly crunchy veggies like romaine lettuce, cabbage, shredded 
carrots & celery, and chopped green onion & cilantro. Also included are a package of crispy rice vermicelli 
noodles & chopped peanuts, and a Thai-inspired zesty peanut & lime dressing. Mixed together, the completed 
Salad evokes the harmonious blend of flavors of a steaming plate of pad thai, while still maintaining the 
invigorating crunch of a fresh, crisp salad. While it's absolutely flavorful and substantial enough on its own as 
a vegan side or entrée, we'd be remiss if we didn't mention the possibilities posed by adding a bit of protein - a 
nice topping of lime-marinated Argentinian Shrimp [sku 71696] sounds especially delicious.

For a limited time, we're selling find 14.5 ounce bags of our pad thai-inspired Trader Joe's Peanut and Crispy 
Noodle Salad Kit. While supplies last, you can find them in our refrigerators, with our other fresh salad kits.

"068470","Unexpected Cheddar Broccoli Soup","When we introduced Trader Joe's Unexpected Cheddar [sku 96923] to our cheese section nearly a decade ago, 
we knew it was going to be a hit. But the extent to which it became a hit, and the fervency of the fanbase that 
formed around it was, let's say¿ unanticipated. For nearly ten years, Unexpected Cheddar has ranked at the top 
of our annual Customers Choice Awards, its creamy, savory profile and mature, almost Parmesan-like notes 
having clearly struck a chord among cheese aficionados. That got us thinking: what other kinds of unexpected 
delights could we make with Unexpected Cheddar? That, in turn, got us tinkering, tasting, and working with a 
trusted supplier to create our new Trader Joe's Unexpected Broccoli Cheddar Soup, the newest addition to 
our line of fresh, ready-to-heat soups.

Made with a rich, flavorful vegetable broth, big chunks of broccoli, and a blend of both our Unexpected Cheddar 
and a traditional yellow Cheddar, every sip of this Soup is creamy, comforting, and almost outrageously cheesy. 
We've found it takes particularly well to being served in a bread bowl, pairing with a warm, toasty grilled 
cheese, or serving alongside a fresh green salad. And while this Soup may be Unexpectedly cheesy, it should 
come as no surprise that its retail is quite reasonable: We're selling 20-ounce tubs of Trader Joe's Unexpected 
Broccoli Cheddar Soup for $4.49*, every day. You can find them in our refrigerators, with our other fresh, 
prepared foods.
