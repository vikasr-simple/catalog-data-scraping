"078977","Very Berry Granola","The saying is as true as it ever was: breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We might add, though, that 
we remain as steadfast to our corollary as we've ever been: just because it's important, doesn't mean it can't also 
be fun. Trader Joe's Very Berry Granola might just be the prime, practical application of this proposition: our 
supplier starts with hearty clusters of rolled oats-the kind of foundation that very important breakfasts are 
built upon-then sprinkles in bits of dried and sweetened blueberries and dried strawberries, so that every bite 
has an elegantly balanced blend of crunchy textures and sweet, fruity flavors. In other words: important, fun, 
and inarguably delicious.

Start your day off with a sublimely simple bowl of this gluten free Very Berry Granola and a splash of milk, or 
your favorite non-dairy alternative. (We find that our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage [sku 65333] makes a particularly 
excellent partner to this Granola's fruit-forward flavors.) Or, if you prefer, end your day with a pitch-perfect 
parfait by layering Very Berry Granola into some Greek Yogurt [sku 69707] with your favorite TJ's fruit 
preserves. In between, you can simply snack on Very Berry Granola by the handful-snacking is certainly 
important (and fun, and delicious) too, after all.

"096070","Organic Virgin Coconut Oil","From Hawaiian shirts to Hibiscus flowers, it's no secret that TJ's loves the tropics. Our tropical outlook has 
inspired a current of products, splashing over into every aisle. Continuing to ride the wave, we simply couldn't 
resist adding Trader Joe's Organic Virgin Coconut Oil to the list.

It starts with freshly harvested, de-husked, and grated Organic coconuts from the Philippines and Sri Lanka. 
The coconut meat is dried, and then cold-pressed and filtered to remove any remaining bits. That's the process, 
nothing more. No Solvents. No additives. What's more, this specific approach preserves the nutrients, flavor 
characteristics, and aromas of fresh coconut. It also allows us to call it ""Virgin"" Coconut Oil.

Our Organic Virgin Coconut Oil will fluctuate from a solid to liquid state, depending on the temperature at 
which it's kept; so, don't be surprised if the solid-looking oil you bought in our cool store turns into a liquid 
when the jar's been stored in your warmer pantry. What's even more surprising than the changing state of your 
Coconut Oil will be its wide variety of uses; from cooking and baking, to skin care, to pulling (the process of 
oral detoxification by swishing oil in your mouth for 10 to 20 minutes). 

There's no shortage of applications for this versatile oil, and there's no shortage 16 ounce jars of Trader Joe's 
Organic Virgin Coconut Oil on our shelves. Stop by and pick some up for $5.49-and enjoy the tropical vibe, 
while you do.

ingredients, crafted by methods approved by experts, and offered at a price that makes them a true value. Our 
latest macaroni product, Trader Joe's Organic Farfalline Pasta doesn't fall far from the value tree-in fact, it's

Our Organic Farfalline Pasta is shaped like mini, rounded bowties-or butterflies, if you will. (Farfalline

pasta texture and taste. Combine this flavor profile with Farfalline's darling dimensions, and you get a tasty,

Andria. A well-known agricultural center, Andria is renowned for its wine, almonds, and olives-olives that 
comprise bright and zesty Trader Joe's Limone Premuto olive oil. 

Limone Premuto contains just two ingredients: olives and Sicilian lemons. While most other lemon-flavored 
olive oils utilize lemon oil or flavoring, our supplier opts for whole lemons for optimal citrus flavor. The olives 
and lemons are processed via cold extraction to preserve their herbaceous and tart notes, resulting in a crisp 
and zesty extra-virgin olive oil that's perfect for lemon lovers.

Limone Premuto is an excellent finishing oil for salads and roasted vegetables. It pairs wonderfully with 
white fish and poultry, especially when they're seasoned with herbs like oregano and rosemary. Serve it with 
sliced Ciabatta Baguette [sku 96398] for a simple and delicious appetizer. Or, craft a rich and bright dessert by

"078799","Bourbon Vanilla Beans","Vanilla, plain? Never! A spice so integral to desserts across the world can't possibly be boring, but it can be quite 
expensive-vanilla beans in particular. That's why Trader Joe's has brought premium Bourbon Vanilla Beans 
to your neighborhood store at a marvelous value!

Vanilla Beans are actually the pods of Vanilla orchids-including V. planifolia, better known as Bourbon 
Vanilla. They were first cultivated on their namesake island of Île Bourbon (now called Réunion) before 
operations moved to its larger neighbor to the west: Madagascar. If ""Vanilla"" and ""Madagascar"" seem 
synonymous, it's because the island's tropical climate and heavy rainfall produces Bourbon Vanilla Beans that 
are especially large, plump, and high in vanillin, the compound that gives the spice its wonderfully sweet and 
""warm"" flavor.

There's one downside to these aromatic and versatile beans: their price tag! Fortunately, we buy ours directly 
from their grower and processor, allowing us to offer offer premium, Madagascar-grown Bourbon Vanilla 
Beans at an amazing value. Bring yours home and incorporate them into baked goods and desserts, Vanilla 
sugar, and Vanilla-infused spirits, while supplies last!

unsung hero of baking and candy making adds nuttiness and depth to all sorts of baked goods and confections.  
High quality almond paste usually comes at a premium price point, but not at Trader Joe's-our Almond 
Paste is the real deal at a really great value!

Made for us in Denmark by the largest Almond Paste and marzipan manufacturer in the world, our Almond 
Paste contains 40% ground Almonds for maximum nuttiness-no extract necessary! The smooth Paste is 
sweetened until it's just sweet enough to use in your favorite baking and candy making recipes. Then, it's 
conveniently packaged into a single tube so you can use as much or as little as you need, without the nuisance 
of jars and unresealable packaging.

Almond Paste shines when incorporated into cookies, cakes, pie crusts, and crumble toppings. Of course, you 
can use it to make marzipan in a jiffy (kids and adults will love shaping it into adorable figurines and dipping 
them in melted chocolate!). Or, add cinnamon and roll the Paste into Organic Crescent Rolls [sku 73773] for 
easy breakfast pastries. Offered at an excellent value, this premium baking ingredient won't last long on our

"078797","Double Fold Alcohol Free Bourbon Vanilla Flavoring","Sweet, warm, and enchantingly floral, there's a reason that vanilla is such a ubiquitous inclusion in baked 
goods and sweet treats-it's simply very good at making desserts, and even savory dishes, taste better. It's also 
a flavor that we think should be available to everyone-even those that don't consume alcohol. That's why, in 
addition to our seasonal Double Fold Vanilla Extract [sku 76665], we offer Trader Joe's Double Fold Alcohol 
Free Bourbon Vanilla Flavoring during the fall and winter seasons. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans 
(which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid), our supplier makes each batch 
with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify 
it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Flavoring that provides an impressive pop 
of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.

With its elegantly-styled, long-necked bottle and charming cork stopper, Trader Joe's Alcohol Free Double 
Fold Vanilla Extract with Vanilla Bean Seeds is an apt and attractive addition to any pantry, and makes 
an ideal gift for home bakers of all experience levels. Perhaps some stores would be content enough with 
these estimable aesthetic and culinary qualities, but since this is Trader Joe's, we've gone the additional step of 
making its value exceptional, too: while supplies last, you can pick up of a bottle of our Alcohol Free Double 
Fold Vanilla Extract for a fraction of the price you'd pay for vanilla flavorings of similar quality elsewhere.

shelves, and it not only became an instant icon of our fall-seasonal selections, it acted as a sort of herald for 
more maple products to come. Then, a few years after that, tragedy struck. A supply issue prevented us from 
bringing it back, for a full two years. But right here and now, we're excited to give that story a happy ending. 
Back with a new supplier, a new look, and the same simple, single-ingredient recipe and superlatively sweet 
taste, Trader Joe's Organic Maple Butter has made its triumphant return!

Indeed, the contents of each jar remain solely Organic Maple syrup that's been reduced down to its purest 
essence, then whipped to a captivatingly creamy consistency. It's still fantastic on French toast, marvelous 
mixed into yogurt, and enchanting as an accompaniment to a cheese board (we particularly like it spread thin 
on a slice of sharp Cheddar). Don't let us dictate how you use it-feel free to let your imagination, and desire

heating the kitchen is no longer a cause for concern, the only real challenge is deciding what to bake first! We 
recommend starting with new Trader Joe's Pumpkin & Spice Snickerdoodle Cookie Mix. 

Pumpkin powder provides an authentic base flavor for this Mix, complemented with the ideal blend of warm 
spices, including cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and clove. Its conveniently pre-measured status allows 
for light work of dough assembly; a stick of butter, an egg, and a tablespoon of cold milk are all that's required 
from your end to stir it together. From there, you simply shape the dough into two-tablespoon-sized balls, roll 
them in the provided Sugar & Spice Mix, then bake at 375°F for about 12 minutes. 

The resulting Cookies are chewy in the center, golden-crisp at the edges, and loaded with sweet, Pumpkin 
& Spice flavor! Enjoy them warm from the oven, perhaps with a cozy mug of Harvest Blend Herbal Tea [sku

"073062","Tikka Masala Curry Sauce","Rich in flavor, vibrantly hued, luxuriously creamy, and exhilaratingly aromatic, tikka masala is one of those 
dishes that's truly capable of captivating all of one's senses at once-even just the sound of it simmering is 
enough to pique our appetites. It also happens to be a dish that's spectacularly suited to vegan variations, like 
the recipe we use in Trader Joe's Tikka Masala Curry Sauce. Each batch is made with a savory, velvety base 
that includes onion, tomato paste, and ground watermelon seeds, and flavored with a selection of seasonings 
and spices including garlic, turmeric, tamarind, and ginger. Altogether, this Tikka Masala Sauce is great for 
crafting Curries that will enchant the senses of vegans and non-vegans alike.

Conveniently shelf table (until opened) and endlessly customizable, our Tikka Masala Curry Sauce is a great 
for everything from quick weeknight dinners to weekly meal prep. Simply choose your veggies (diced potatoes, 
peas, and cauliflower are always a good start) and a protein (tofu or lentils to keep it plant-based, chicken to 
keep it classic), sauté them all in a saucepan until cooked through, then add the Sauce and simmer for a few 
minutes. Once your Curry is ready, you're free to serve over basmati rice or Organic Riced Cauliflower [sku 
54241], and accessorize with sides like Naan [sku 77677] and Mini Vegetable Samosas [sku 61534].

"077253","Italian Whole Peeled Tomatoes with Basil Leaf","It's a true cultural wonder that the ""plump fruit"" (as the Aztecs used to call it) once only found in South
America, is today most closely associated with a particular, boot-shaped nation that's an ocean away. Part of the 
reason for this is that Italians use tomatoes in so many delicious dishes, from pasta & pizza sauces to salads & 
soups. Trader Joe's Italian Whole Peeled Tomatoes are not only ready to use in all those dishes and more, but 
they also possess the cachet that comes with being grown & packed in Italy!

Each 28-ounce can is filled with juicy, deep-red, Roma tomatoes that are grown in the Puglia region of Italy
(aka the 'heel of the boot'). These particular 'plump fruits' are picked at peak harvest near the end of summer.
The Tomatoes are then quickly delivered to Naples, where they are peeled & packed with tomato juice and
Basil Leaves. And by quickly, we mean they go from harvest-to-can in just 12 hours!

The colorful cans are then delivered to your neighborhood Trader Joe's, where you can pick them up for use
in the dishes your home is known for. Blend up these beauts (Basil, juice, and all) to use in your homemade
pasta sauce. Drain them, halve them, and drop them in simmering chicken soup, or scatter them atop TJ's Pizza 
Dough [sku 92334] with Fresh Mozzarella Pearls [sku 76317] and Organic Basil [sku 67343]. You'll find colorful 
cans of Trader Joe's Italian Whole Peeled Tomatoes with Basil Leaf on our shelves, every day.

"079469","Eliros Extra Virgin Olive Oil","In a nation known for its rich, flavorful olives, the island of Crete just might be the jewel in Greece's olive-
wreathed crown. Here, among the sloping, seaside hills, family-owned farms have cultivated olives for 
generations stretching back to the furthest edges of antiquity. Available at your neighborhood Trader Joe's 
for a limited time, Eliros Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes to us from a collective of these small, family farms, 
who hand-pick Koroneiki olives and cold extract them (which is to say, spin them in a centrifuge until the 
oil seperates from the fruit, all while keeping everything below 80°F). The cold extraction process further 
preserves the olives' rich flavor, resulting in a lush, buttery, and delightfully tangy EVOO that's especially suited 
for drizzling over grilled fish, finishing off a well-seared steak, and dipping with a nice hunk of bread.

While many of the olive oils we carry on an everyday basis are excellent for cooking, Eliros Extra Virgin Olive 
Oil should be considered more of a finishing oil-we find that its full flavors and peppery notes hold up best 
when left unheated. Try drizzling it over a sheet pan of roasted veggies, mixing it into bold and full-bodied 
salad dressings, or giving it a toss with freshly cooked ravioli or tortellini just prior to serving. And you truly 
can't go wrong simply dipping it with a bit of focaccia or toasty baguette, as-is or seasoned with aromatic herbs, 
grated Parmesan cheese, and sweet Balsamic Vinegar [sku 53743].

is currently enjoying a moment in the culinary spotlight-one need look no further than the unparalleled 
Brown Sugar Cardamom Buns [sku 76823] on our bakery tables for proof. In keeping with that spirit of sweetly 
spiced exploration of flavor, our product developer worked with a Belgian supplier known for their high quality 
fruit spreads to craft the newest, limited-edition addition to our grocery shelves, just in time for summer. 
Introducing Trader Joe's Apricot Cardamom Spread!

Made with an impressive 55% Apricot, this thick, sweet-tart Spread offers the sunny notes of its namesake 
stone fruit, commingled with the pleasant warmth of Cardamom. Spiced (but not overly so), this brightly 
flavored, fiery orange-hued Spread is an able accompaniment to cheese-think slices of sharply flavored Grana 
Padano Parmesan [sku 25808] or velvety Triple Creme Brie [sku 55406] to complement its natural acidity-and 
would be equally at home on a toasted English Muffin [sku 14626] or AB&ACS (Almond Butter [sku 51436] and

"006372","Pumpkin Butter","Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter doesn't actually contain butter, but it does have a distinctively rich, butter-
like consistency - partially attributable to its fruit pulp-to-sugar ratio, which is higher than that of jam or 
preserves. Pumpkin puree is cooked slowly, in small batches, with sugar, honey and spices, so the spices 
have plenty of time to marry with the pumpkin. Our Pumpkin Butter is smooth and light yet decadent 
tasting. In fact, it tastes much like pumpkin pie, except there are no eggs or cream in this spread, and thus no 
fat. Shocking, really, once you've tasted it.

How should you use Pumpkin Butter? That's entirely up to you, of course, but we're happy to start you off 
with some ideas. Heat it and pour over vanilla ice cream for a pumpkin sundae. Spread it on toast, waffles, 
a bagel, or our Buttermilk Biscuits for breakfast. Make a peanut butter and Pumpkin Butter sandwich. You 
could also take equal parts Pumpkin Butter and cream and heat, stirring well, to create a creamy pumpkin 
sauce to serve atop ravioli or tortellini.

Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter is made to our specifications without preservatives or artificial colors or 
flavors. In addition to being fat free, it's also cholesterol free and sodium free, and it's high in vitamin A. 
We're selling each 10 ounce jar of Trader Joe's Pumpkin Butter for $2.29, the same price it's been since

"078573","Green Tea and Yuzu Spread","Originally cultivated in mainland East Asia, but now more typically associated with Japanese cuisine, speci¿ cally, 
a yuzu is a refreshingly aromatic citrus with a ¿ avor somewhere between a grapefruit and a Mandarin orange. 
It's o¿ en paired with sweeter, spicier, and earthier ¿ avors, and makes a particularly great pairing with honey, 
chile peppers, and green tea. In fact, that last combo is what inspired our uniquely delicious, summer-seasonal, 
Trader Joe's Green Tea & Yuzu Spread. 

It's cra¿ ed for us in small batches by a supplier in Belgium, who's particularly adept at combining complementary 
ingredients to create uniquely rich ¿ avor pro¿ les. In this case, they mix Green Tea that's been infused with 
lemongrass, ginger, and orange peel, along with apple and lemon juice concentrates and tantalizingly tart Yuzu 
juice, resulting in a sweet, citric, marvelously multi-dimensional Spread. Aside from making an excellent jelly 
for your morning toast or mu¿  n, it also provides a pronounced pop of ¿ avor when spread on sandwiches, over 
roast chicken and ¿ sh, or mixed into marinades. And when you've got friends over for a charcuterie board or 
cheese plate, trust us: adding a bit of Green Tea & Yuzu Spread will make those savory ¿ avors truly sing.

all delicious treats, and each highlights in a special way the taste-relationship between PB & C. Missing here 
is anything tailor-made for breakfast-time enjoyment. With this top of mind, Trader Joe's Organic Peanut 
Butter & Cocoa Crunch really delivers, for breakfast and beyond.

This cereal begins with Organic corn meal that's been sweetened and puffed into crunchy, bite-sized spheres. 
About half of the puffs are flavored with Organic Peanut Butter, and the other half with Organic fair trade 
Cocoa powder. This combo really delivers on your PB-Chocolate flavor expectations. (If it's even more 
chocolate flavor that you're after, we recommend swapping regular milk out for Trader Joe's Fair Trade Cocoa 
Chocolate Milk [sku 61673].

Each bowl of gluten free Peanut Butter & Cocoa Crunch presents a pleasing contrast of favored flavors, and a 
real study in Crunch, though we imagine that your cereal won't stay in the bowl with milk long enough to get 
scientific with the exact crunch time numbers. We're looking forward to waking up to this sweet and crunchy

We'll devour zingy Kosher Pickles anytime, anywhere-sandwich or no sandwich! Crack open a 24-fluid

"078121","Peanut Butter with Honey","Peanut butter is an undeniably sought after flavor in some of our customers' favorite products (e.g., Peanut 
Butter Pretzels, Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups, et al.). As such, our buyers have spent quite a bit of time 
exploring where else to employ peanut butter. But when they started pondering how we might put other things 
into peanut butter, we knew they'd hit a gold mine-or, rather, honey pot. Introducing Trader Joe's Peanut 
Butter with Honey! 

Made with just three ingredients-dry roasted peanuts, honey, and salt-the coarse texture of this peanut 
butter falls somewhere in between creamy and crunchy, giving it loads of textural interest when spread on a 
sandwich or Whole Wheat English Muffin [sku 14627]. The addition of sea salt amplifies the floral sweetness of 
the honey, and further highlights the round, roasted flavor of the peanuts. Unlike other brands on the market, 
our Peanut Butter with Honey contains no hydrogenated oils-give it a good stir before enjoying and you'll 
be ready to spread with abandon.

"077664","Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese","Our boxed Mac & Cheese is back! While we have numerous heat & eat, cheesy-mac options in our freezers 
every day, there's something about boiling fresh pasta and stirring it together with butter, milk, and cheese that 
really stirs up one's nostalgia. Trader Joe's Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese rises to meet all of your childhood 
memories and more!

Each box contains little tube-shaped Macaroni that you boil in a saucepan to your desired tenderness. We 
recommend 7-9 minutes. To the drained pasta, add 4 tablespoons of butter (we suggest salted), ¿ cup of milk, 
and the included cheese packet. The Cheddar Cheese seasoning blend creates a creamy, ultra-cheesy sauce to 
coat the tubes inside and out. And that classic orange color only comes naturally, from annatto and paprika.

Trader Joe's Cheddar Macaroni & Cheese is so good, just as it is. But you can also doctor it up, as you please. 
For an extra rich & tangy sauce, try mixing 1-2 tablespoons of Trader Joe's Plain Greek Whole Milk Yogurt [sku

"056687","Avocado Oil","From the world's most avocado-rich region-Michoacán, Mexico-we've recently introduced Trader Joe's Avo-
cado Oil. Michoacán's tropical climate, rich volcanic soil, and ample rainfall make it an ideal area for avocado 
cultivation. 

The differing elevations on the (inactive) volcanic slopes result in multiple microclimates. So, depending on 
location, trees bloom at different times during the year-which means there are always fresh avocados to be 
had! Avocados are also plentiful because individual trees actually bloom and produce fruit twice each year. An 
abundant avocado crop not only means plenty of avocados for eating, but it also equates to plenty left over for 
making Trader Joe's Avocado Oil.

Avocado Oil is high in monounsaturated fats and an excellent cooking oil, with a smoke point of 520ºF (signifi-
cantly higher than olive oil, which has a smoke point closer to 350ºF). The clean, delicate flavor is a great match 
for all kinds of uses, from sautéing to baking to searing to garnishing. 

Trader Joe's Avocado Oil is an excellent addition to your pantry, and a good alternative to olive or other vegeta-
ble oils. We're selling each 16.9 fluid ounce bottle for $8.99, an excellent price for this versatile, light-tasting oil.

These Tomatoes come to us from a fourth-generation tomato processor in Turkey. (Fun fact: Turkey is the third-

into their solar-powered facility, where they Slow Roast them for eight hours. This process intensifies their 
inherently bright and tangy flavors and yields a tender, soft-dried texture that falls somewhere between a fresh 
Roma and a classic sun-dried tomato. Marinated in a combination of sunflower and extra virgin olive oils with

came to life amidst the bright, savory-sweetness of the tomatoes and onions. Our tasting panel was taken by 
surprise-these wondrous, not-at-all-bitter eggplants really came from a can? Really? Really.

Grecian Style Eggplant with Tomatoes & Onions is made for us in Bulgaria, where the eggplant is grown, by 
our famed Greek Dolmas producers. (They have a production facility in that Southeastern European country, 
so the eggplant can be cooked immediately upon harvest from the fields.) Whole, long, narrow eggplants-har-

and onions. Seasoned with parsley, garlic, red pepper and curry powder, and canned with soy oil, the gently-
flavored, purple fruits of the nightshade family blossom with seductive, Mediterranean essence.

The eggplant halves unfurl from the can, impressively intact. Place them on a plate for a ready-to-enjoy (room 
temp or warmed) edible. Serve them as a side to roasted lamb and rice, or as a salad with fresh green bell 
peppers and feta. Broil with a little cheese and coarsely chop to create a delicious and unique pasta topping.

aroma-and all after a single minute in the microwave, or a few minutes submerged in boiling water.

Packed inside a convenient, shelf-stable pouch, this creamy, savory, and rich Coconut Chickpea Curry can 
be enjoyed as a standalone meal for one, with or without a bed of Basmati Rice [sku 25880], or as part of a 
larger, Indian-inspired spread alongside other favorites like our Tikka Vegetables [sku 61403] and Kitchari [sku 
71109]. We find that with its ease of preparation, and the fact that it can be stored at room temperature, it's 
great for keeping on hand for last-minute weeknight dinners, easy weekend lunches, or, if you're a fan of the 
great outdoors, toting along on camping trips and backpacking excursions.

"076536","Calamari Pieces in Olive Oil","In the U.S., calamari conjures up a platter piled with crisp, fried, rings of squid-garnished with lemon wedges 
and a sauce for dipping. But in Europe, calamari (which simply means ""squid"" in Italian) refers more generally 
to squid in a variety of culinary forms. And at Trader Joe's, Calamari Pieces in Olive Oil refers to an excellent 
'tinned-fish' value that is simple, convenient, and delicious!

In the tin are Humboldt-variety squid (aka 'Giant Squid'), which are caught off the coast of Spain using the 
traditional jigging method. Fishers drop lines with multiple lures deep into the ocean and 'jiggle' to attract the 
squid. The large tentacles of the captured Calamari are cleaned & cooked just enough to yield a firm, yet tender 
texture. They're cut into 1.5-centimeter chunks and packed with extra virgin olive oil & salt. 

The mild, slightly briny flavor and tender, meaty texture of Trader Joe's Calamari Pieces in Olive Oil should 
win over even the most 'tin-ative' tasters; especially when incorporated into a charcuterie board with toasted 
Organic Baguette slices [sku 53835], Mini Heirloom Tomatoes [sku 91008], Colossal Garlic -Stuffed Olives [sku

"079467","Red Island Australian Extra Virgin Olive Oil","A typical olive harvest takes place over the course of three or four months, starting in mid-autumn and lasting 
through early winter. During that first month or so, the olives are still not quite fully ripe, so while it takes more 
of them to produce the same amount of oil as later-harvest olives, the oil that is produced tends to be much 
more flavorful-and, often, much more expensive, too. Unless, of course, you happen to be shopping at Trader 
Joe's. Because for a limited time, we're bringing in this super limited-edition Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive 
Oil from the folks at Red Island® in Australia, and at a price that's a fraction of what you'd pay for similar, early-
harvest olive oil elsewhere.

Made with Early Harvest olives grown on a single estate, which are then cold pressed to preserve even more 
flavor, this extra special EVOO can be used in all the same kitchen contexts you'd employ for an everyday olive 
oil, like sautéeing or roasting. To take full advantage of its smooth and fruity profile, and nutty, delicately tannic 
finish, however, we find it truly excels when enjoyed as a base for a salad dressing, or when dunked with hunks 
of crusty bread.

"079468","Cal Pressed California Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil","In many ways, a bottle of olive oil is like a bottle of wine. Just like a wine's terroir, the environment in which 
olives are grown makes a tremendous difference in how their oil will ultimately taste. And, just as it is with a 
fine wine, smaller batches and more dedicated, hands-on production methods tend to result in significantly 
higher quality. That's certainly the case with this highly limited offering from the folks at Cal Pressed. Made 
with olives sourced from a handful of small, family farms in California's Central Valley, this first pressing of 
their 2023 harvest is beautifully balanced, with a lush, butter-forward profile that's accented by gentle fruity 
and peppery notes, before finishing with just a subtle hint of grass.

Available at Trader Joe's only for a limited time, and at a price that's a fraction of what you'd pay for olive oils 
of this quality elsewhere, Cal Pressed Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil can be used in practically any kitchen 
context-for sautéeing, grilling, even baking-but where it really excels is as a finishing oil. Try drizzling it over 
a sheet of freshly roasted vegetables, rubbing it over a salmon fillet before air-frying, or lightly pouring it over 
sliced tomatoes, torn basil leaves, and Mozzarella Pearls [sku 76317] for an incomparable caprese. Or, to truly 
savor, simply enjoy it by dipping with plain crostini, as part of a charcuterie spread.

so Trader Joe's This Strawberry Walks Into A Bar, where the strawberry filling is so prominent, it really does 
seem like the strawberries walked right into the bar! 

In all seriousness, This Strawberry Walks Into A Bar¿ may have a silly name, but there's nothing silly about 
it.  Like the other bars with the same name (different flavors), these are made with the highest quality fruit, 
organic grains, and no hydrogenated oils or trans fats. They're packed with fruit filling, and really deliver on the 
promised flavor profile.  They're low in fat and sodium, and they're individually wrapped for your convenience.  
And on top of all that, they taste great! What, you think we're joking? No way. These bars are the real deal,

a little bit, because there is not much to say about what's in Trader Joe's Peanut Butter. This Peanut Butter is 
made with just one ingredient: peanuts. That's it. The ingredients don't necessarily say a whole lot (it is just one 
ingredient), but it actually does. It goes without saying that there are no sweeteners, binders, or added oils and 
that speaks volumes about our Peanut Butter, even though it's just peanuts.  They are dry roasted, made into 
the most delicious, Crunchy and Unsalted Peanut Butter.

Unlike some other peanut butters with added partially hydrogenated oils, ours does not solidify - the oils do 
separate from the solids. A good stir gets it ready to roll. A hint: store it upside down before you open it - this 
simplifies the stirring and keeps the natural oils from separating so much. Come in (to the grocery aisle). Buy 
some Peanut Butter. Save some bread. Talk about value!

recorded recipes for couscous date back to the 11th century CE, some archaeological evidence suggests that 
ancient cultures in the region may have enjoyed couscous (or foods very similar to it) as far back as the third 
century BCE. So, how should we honor a dish with such a superlatively storied history? We're starting by 
introducing Trader Joe's Organic Couscous to our grocery shelves. Now, all that separates you from this 
marveously mild-flavored and delicately-textured side dish is a cup of water or broth, a microwave or stove, 
and a few minutes of your time.

Our supplier makes and mills this Couscous from organic wheat grown right here in the United States. It can 
be prepared a number of different ways, including in the microwave, but if you ask us, our favorite method is to 
bring a cup of your favorite broth, combined with two tablespoons of butter, to a boil, remove it from heat, then 
stir in one cup of this Organic Couscous, cover, and let sit. After only five minutes, you should have a hearty, 
fork-fluffable side that's ideal for serving alongside grilled salmon, Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667], or

To make each Bar, our supplier combines our widely celebrated Joe's Os with roasted peanuts and lightly 
salted peanut butter, before finishing with a light drizzling of peanut-flavored coating. The result is a beautifully 
balanced mix of sweet, salty, crunchy and chewy in every bite. They make a great on-the-go treat for morning

The bite of pepper is part of what makes it so prized, and this unique pungency comes from a naturally occurring

Our Black Peppercorns come whole and packaged in their own Grinder, which is a benefit to maintaining 
freshness, along with a culinary convenience. Remove the cap, turn the jar upside down and twist to get pure, 
piquant flecks of black pepper. Or you can screw off the cap if you need to add some whole peppercorns to your 
pot.  To add depth and vibrancy to flavors, grind our Black Peppercorns over eggs, steak, mashed potatoes, 
pasta, soup, sprouts, freshly sliced tomatoes, strawberries...you get the picture.

dish.  While the 'stuffing' and 'something' can vary widely, rice and grape leaves are a classic, vegetarian 
Dolmas combination. So; that's what we went with for Trader Joe's Dolmas.

Trader Joe's Dolmas are made by a Greek company in Evia, the isle shaped like a seahorse. Okay, they're 
not just any Greek company; they're the largest Dolmas (Ntolmadakia) producer in the world, with more 
than 50 years of experience under their vine leaves. They deliver authenticity and are adept in their stuffing 
of somethings. Trader Joe's Dolmas are crafted according to an age-old, Mediterranean recipe, using tender 
vine leaves. By hand, the leaves are stuffed, one by one, with a soft, succulent white rice that's mixed with 
chopped onions, bits of dill and mint. Dexterously rolled and folded, the leaves and rice are transformed into 
two-bite morsels, which are cooked to marry flavors and create a moist, tender bite. Packed in soy oil, they 
eat like they were freshly prepared and promise a little spice, a little savory and a little tang. Enjoy them 
cold, as a snack, or serve them warm with a dipping sauce - Tzatziki, Lemon Tahini (tahini, lemon juice 
& garlic - blended), or Greek Yogurt & Dill - for an iconic meze. They pair well with a dry white, like a 
Sauvignon Blanc.

""big names"" in peanut butter add all kinds of sweeteners and additives to theirs.  Trader Joe's Crunchy Salted 
Peanut Butter, on the other hand, is simple-and simply scrumptious. It's made from just two ingredients 
(peanuts and salt), and it's been a staple on our shelves for more than 30 years.

Our supplier sources their peanuts from the southeastern United States and dry roasts them with the skins still 
on-which really enhances the flavor of the finished product. Then, they grind the peanuts into ""butter,"" taking 
care not to grind them all the way, so that the resulting Peanut Butter has plenty of Crunchy peanut bits all 
throughout. Take note: we don't add any hydrogenated oils or stabilizers, so the Peanut Butter won't ever fully 
solidify. When left to sit, the oils will separate from the solids in the jar, but with a quick stir, you're well on your 
way to PB&J sandwiches, satay sauces, pies, cookies, and more! Pro-Tip: store the jar upside down before you 
open it-this simplifies the stirring and keeps the natural oils from separating so much.

Brownie Truffle Baking Mix, you're given the best of both worlds! Excellent taste and texture from excellent 
ingredients without having to source them and learn to whip 'em up yourself. After approximately 45 minutes, 
including prep time, and adding only 2 large eggs and a melted stick of butter - both also available everyday

your friends and family at a get-together or have at-the-ready for a post-dinner delight.

And at-the-ready you'll be from the second you begin to smell the illustrious aroma coming from the oven. 
Our Brownie Truffle Baking Mix includes dutch cocoa. And no, this doesn't mean it wears cute little 
wooden shoes, but instead means that it was processed with alkali and doesn't contain the acidity or strong, 
concentrated cocoa flavor. This makes for a chocolatey brownie, that while still very chocolatey, it's a different 
kind of chocolatey. For good measure, we also throw in chocolate chips which, when melted from the baking, 
create little islands of melty-chocolatey goodness with every bite. But don't let us dictate what you can add! 
Along with the pre-added chocolate chips, have some fun and toss in your favorite nuts or Trader Joe candies

"077636","Aglio Olio Seasoning Blend","Aglio e olio (that's Italian for ""garlic and oil"") is a classic Neapolitan dish, consisting of long pasta (often 
spaghetti) tossed in a sauce of pantry staples, including olive oil, plenty of thinly sliced garlic, and chili flakes. 
It's also the inspiration behind the newest addition to our grocery shelves: Trader Joe's Aglio Olio Garlicky 
& Spicy Seasoning Blend. Packed into a shakeable glass jar, this Blend combines the beloved Italian flavor 
components of the dish in dried form, along with parsley flakes and sea salt-no more slicing slippery garlic 
cloves! Dinner can be ready in the length of time it takes to cook your noodles of choice. 

Pasta aside, you can highlight this Seasoning Blend's Garlicky goodness in a quick dipping sauce of olive oil 
for toasted bread. Why not make a Garlicky and Spicy compound butter with Cultured Salted Butter [sku 
53720] for homemade garlic bread? Or perhaps use it in marinades or dry rubs, or sprinkle it over potatoes 
or eggs¿ For true Aglio lovers, combine it with Roasted Garlic Hummus [sku 29911] for the Garlicky dip of 
your dreams. You can find our kosher-certified, 1.7-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Aglio Olio Garlicky & Spicy 
Seasoning Blend among our array of spices, every day.

"076862","Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste","If you've ever spent any time baking, you've likely dealt with vanilla extract before (it's basically the duct tape of 
the baking world). What you might not have encountered, however, is vanilla paste. What's the difference, you 
ask? Aside from their distinct methods of production (vanilla extract is made by soaking pure vanilla beans in 
a solution of water and alcohol, whereas vanilla paste is a mix of vanilla beans, sugar syrup, and some vanilla 
extract to tie them all together), vanilla paste is thicker, richer in taste, and tends to have more visible bits of 
vanilla bean throughout, making it a preferable option for recipes where you really want the vanilla to be front 
and center. And that's exactly where Trader Joe's Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste excels.

Made for us by a supplier in Mauritius with 100% Bourbon (as in, grown in one of the designated Bourbon 
islands within the Indian Ocean) Vanilla Beans, this Vanilla Paste adds a well-rounded sweetness and deep, 
full-bodied flavor of vanilla to cakes, cookies, pies, and more. It can be used in a straight 1:1 ratio as a substitute 
for vanilla extract, for any recipe you'd like to make that much more vanilla-y, and makes an excellent ingredient 
for cocktails, milkshakes, and homemade coffee drinks. Try mixing a small spoonful in your next batch of 
whipped cream, French toast batter, or even your morning yogurt.

"051524","Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli Pasta","Quinoa is an ancient grain that has continued to grow in acclaim. Its current popularity pivots on its inviting, 
nutty taste, versatility and nutritional prowess. It's a complete protein, a good source of fiber and provider 
of essential vitamins and minerals such as calcium, phosphorus & iron. As such, quinoa and products made 
with it have become all the rage. 

Take ""Quinoa Pasta"" - it's totally hot. In fact, our customers have been very vocal about their interest in our 
carrying it. When we commenced our creation of a quinoa-containing pasta, we were taken aback. What 
we discovered was that the majority of pastas claiming to be ""made of quinoa"" were comprised of just 5%. 
That's not only ridiculous, it's misleading. With this understanding, we were committed to creating pasta 
that contained a notable amount of quinoa - as much as we could cram in without the pasta falling apart in 
texture. We got to 20% organic quinoa!! In our desire to keep the profile as intriguing as possible, we used 
organic brown rice to balance out the rest. It complemented the subtle, nutty flavor, rounded out the texture, 
and supported the nutritious intent. Gluten free, sugar free, sodium fee, low in fat and with five grams of 
protein per serving, Trader Joe's Organic Brown Rice & Quinoa Fusilli Pasta is something we are proud 
to offer. And the integrity of our ingredients is as impressive as our reasonable price. We're selling each 16

"076721","Rice Vinegar","A true building block of many East Asian cuisines, the origins of rice vinegar date somewhere between four 
and five thousand years ago to ancient China. It's traditionally made by fermenting rice wine, and over its long 
and storied history has been used as everything from a flavoring agent, to a preservative, to a beverage. Trader 
Joe's Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it's certainly not lacking for 
flavor. Tart, tangy, and just a touch sweet, with a slightly sharp note for cutting through and brightening other 
flavors, it's an ideal ingredient for adding to salad dressings, sauces, and marinades of all kinds.

A bit of our Rice Vinegar will add an extra dimension of flavor to stir-fries, soups, and even just a freshly 
cooked pot of plain white rice. When mixed with soy sauce, it makes an excellent condiment for any of our 
gyoza or soup dumpling options, though we'll leave the exact ratio to your personal tastes (some prefer equal 
parts soy sauce to Rice Vinegar, others enjoy two parts Vinegar to one part soy sauce). And when making 
quick pickles, a last-minute seaweed salad, or homemade banchan to pair with some Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice 
with Kimchi [sku 67480], our Rice Vinegar is nothing short of a must-have.

"058089","Blue Cheese Stuffed Chalkidiki Olives","Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle is credited with developing the cultivation of the olive into a science.  So, 
it should come as no surprise that his home on the Chalkidiki peninsula (adjacent to Mt. Athos) and the nearby 
seaside Kavala region is also home to some of the world's most gigantic, meaty, buttery olives-Chalkidiki Olives. 
We are not sure who is credited with transforming the stuffing of olives into an art, so we'll quickly acknowledge 
the genius and skip right to introducing our new Blue Cheese Stuffed Chalkidiki Olives. They're just brilliant.

Together, this carefully curated trio can be enjoyed in all kinds of scenarios, from a cocktail party hors d'oeuvre 
table, to a date night charcuterie plate, to even a simple, anytime, right-out-of-the-fridge snack. However, we 
like them best when employed as their name implies: as a consummate Conversation starter. Keep a jar on 
hand to idly snack on whenever a friend comes over to chat. Serve them alongside a nice cheese for an elevated

"075641","Classic Bitters","Bitters are an aromatic flavoring agent, made from infusing any combination of fruit peels, spices, herbs, barks 
or flowers in high-proof alcohol. Historically reputed to have medicinal properties, they were once prescribed 
as cure-alls for headaches, stomachaches, indigestion, and cramps. Fast-forward to modern day usage, however, 
and you can think of bitters as a bartender's ""salt-and-pepper,"" a liquid seasoning of sorts that adds depth and 
nuance that really tie a drink together.

Trader Joe's Classic Bitters are aromatic and complex, with strong notes of clove, cinnamon, and herbs. They're 
made exclusively for us in downtown Los Angeles at the first licensed distillery since Prohibition. A bottle of 
Classic Bitters is befitting of any bar setup and is made without the use of artificial flavors or coloring, which 
can't be said for similar products out in the market. 

The aforementioned process of infusing botanicals into alcohol to create these Bitters can take anywhere from 
days to weeks, requiring careful testing along the way to ensure the desired flavor and quality of the end 
product. With Trader Joe's Classic Bitters, the work has been done for you, so all you have to do is open the 
bottle and add them to your drink of choice-Old Fashioned, anyone? And if cocktails aren't your calling, 
fret not-there are plenty of other uses for bitters. You can add a few splashes to iced tea, shake them over ice 
cream, or dash atop a fruit bowl for added complexity and spice.

addition of actual corn kernels in the mix - the corn adds a bit of chew to the texture, too. 

Preparing this Mix couldn't be easier-simply beat an egg with 3/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup oil, then stir in the 
mix, just until moistened. Pour the batter into a greased 8x8-inch square pan, and then bake! With a simple 
spread of whipped butter or a drizzle of honey, you'll be in cornbread heaven in no time (okay, some time -

"075723","Organic Farfalle Rigate Pasta","Named after the Italian word for ""butterfles"", and also known in other parts of Italy as strichetti (""bow ties""), 
Farfalle are far and away one of our very favorite pasta shapes. While their resemblance to pollinators and 
pieces of neckwear is certainly charming, they also serve a purpose beyond simple aesthetics: both the ruffled 
edges of the ""wings"" and the pinched point in the middle help each piece of Farfalle hold on to sauces and 
oils, and thus deliver more flavor with every bite. Made for us by the same expert Italian pasta manufacturer 
as many of our celebrated, limited-run, organic pastas, Trader Joe's Organic Farfalle Rigate takes this design 
philosophy one step further, via the introduction of radiating ridges (hence, ""Rigate"") on every piece. 

In addition to providing an even more satisfyingly toothsome texture (especially when cooked al dente), these 
ridges also make their bronze-die-cut Farfalle Rigate that much better at holding our Basil Pesto [sku 75825], 
Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta Sauce [sku 50776], or any other pasta sauce you choose to toss them in. While 
we find that they're especially suited for richer, creamier sauces, the truth is, you really can't go wrong with 
Farfalle of this quality. Even just a bit of your favorite TJ's olive oil, minced garlic, and crushed red chili peppers 
will make a fantastic Farfalle aglio e olio. Just be sure to pick up a package while you can: supplies are limited, 
and we wouldn't be at all surprised if these Organic Farfalle fly off the shelves before too long.

bowl of Trader Joe's Chicken Noodle Soup. 

This Soup starts with a base of savory Chicken broth and hearty chunks of white Chicken meat. From there,

the allium-y goodness of garlic and onion powders. Bringing the classic Chicken Soup vibe full-circle is the

either. You'll find this Chicken Noodle Soup on our grocery shelves for a super value, every day.

"062234","Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar","Perhaps when you think of Apple Cider Vinegar, you think of salad dressing. You wouldn't be wrong to do 
so-Apple Cider Vinegar mixed with extra virgin olive oil makes for one snazzy dressing. And it's also useful 
in baking and sauce-making. But did you know that some folks sip this stuff? Yup, true story. For centuries, 
Apple Cider Vinegar has been lauded by devotees as a kind of ""miracle tonic."" 

Now, we can't speak to whether or not it can perform anything even resembling a miracle, but here is a claim 
that we will make: new Trader Joe's Organic Raw Apple Cider Vinegar is unpasteurized, unfiltered, and-to 
the delight of customers everywhere-contains ""the mother."" Not to be confused with your mother (who is 
none of the things we are about to describe), the mother is the goopy, globby, strand-like layer seen at the 
bottom of the bottle that contains a multitude of enzymes and gut-friendly bacteria. As anyone touting Apple 
Cider Vinegar as a ""miracle tonic"" will tell you, the mother is where it's at-a fermented mecca, if you will-
and our former TJ's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar [sku 24472] was pasteurized and did not contain the mother. 

We may have kaizen-ed this prouct, but we haven't raised its price- we're still selling each 16.9-fluid ounce

"021509","Organic Hearty Vegetable Broth","Ideal for warm winter meals and early spring soups, Trader Joe's Organic Vegetable Broth is fully cooked, 
ready to heat and serve. The recipe begins with organically grown veggies like carrots, celery, onion, leeks, and 
tomatoes. These veggies, along with a carefully selected assortment of herbs and spices, are slow simmered in 
small batches to create broth that's simultaneously light and incredibly rich in flavor.

Use our Organic Hearty Vegetable Broth to make soups or stews, in place of milk & butter in mashed potatoes, 
or as a substitute for meat-based broths in gravies and sauces. For a quick winter warm-up, heat a cup of Broth 
and serve with crusty bread or your favorite croutons.  It's gluten free and fat free, You'll find each resealable

"055238","Organic Coconut Milk","Until now, Trader Joe's has never carried a regular coconut milk-just a thicker Coconut Cream [98902], and 
a thinner, lower-fat version. In seeking out the perfect ""middle"" milk, we traveled to Sri Lanka, the only place 
where the sweet King Coconut variety grows.

We had three main goals: One, we wanted a coconut milk that can be certified organic. Two, we wanted a 
product that has no gums added to it. Three, of course, we wanted a milk that tastes great. Trader Joe's Organic 
Coconut Milk scores on all three counts!

Our Sri Lankan supplier starts with organically-grown King Coconut. As true ""coconut scientists,"" these experts 
know how to press shredded coconut meat at different stages and blend the resulting milks to create the exact 
flavor profile we are looking for. It's a clean coconutty flavor, with a mild coconut aroma. The texture is smooth 
and milky-not to too thick or too thin. Amazingly, they've achieved this texture without the use of thickeners 
or gums-additives that are present in most of the other coconut milk brands you'll find in the marketplace. The 
only thing added to our Coconut Milk is a small amount of filtered water that helps to balance the fat content.

Cook with it-our Organic Coconut Milk is excellent in curries. Drink it-it is fantastic in smoothies, as a 
substitute for dairy in tea and coffee, or straight from the can (though we recommend pouring it into a nice 
smooth-rimmed drinking glass first). However you enjoy it, we think you'll find our first ever Organic Coconut 
Milk to be exactly what you're looking for-at the price you're looking for, too. Each 14 ounce can is $1.69.

"075961","Gluten Free Tagliatelle Pasta","In the not-too-distant past, pasta options for those avoiding gluten were grim, at best. As pasta production 
and ingredients evolved, our product developers worked diligently to bring customers gluten free pastas that 
weren't just good for gluten free, but great pastas that also happened to be gluten free (see Organic Brown Rice 
Penne [sku 64058], Organic Red Lentil Sedanini [sku 58259], and Hearts of Palm Pasta [sku 67844], just to name 
a few). It's with the aforementioned standard for greatness in mind that we welcome Trader Joe's Gluten Free 
Tagliatelle Pasta to the pasta party! 

Our Italian supplier-who specializes in Gluten Free pastas-uses a combination of corn and rice flours to 
create Tagliatelle noodles nearly indistinguishable from their gluten-full counterparts. Taking their name 
from the Italian tagliatare, meaning ""to cut,"" the long, ribbon-like noodles are wider and slightly thinner than 
fettuccine. They're dried into nests that easily unravel in a pot of boiling water; when cooked al dente, they 
possess a pleasant chew akin to durum wheat pasta, ready to support the heartiest sauces with ease. Try making 
your own Cacio e Pepe by adding Grated Pecorino Romano Cheese [sku 82807] and freshly cracked Black 
Peppercorns [sku 57365] to a some of the reserved pasta water before tossing it with the Tagliatelle Pasta.

"076665","Double Fold Bourbon Vanilla Extract","All too often, ""vanilla"" is considered the default flavor-the boring, mundane choice at the ice cream parlor. 
In reality, vanilla is a rapturously rich and utterly unique flavor. Sweet, warm, and enchantingly floral, there's 
a reason that vanilla is such a ubiquitous inclusion in baked goods and sweet treats-it's simply very good at 
making desserts, and even savory dishes, taste better. That's why, starting now through the end of the holiday 
season, we're proud to offer Trader Joe's Double Fold Vanilla Extract. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans 
(which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid ), our supplier makes each batch 
with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify 
it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Extract that provides an impressive pop of 
vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.

With its elegantly-styled, long-necked bottle and charming cork stopper, Trader Joe's Double Fold Vanilla 
Extract with Vanilla Bean Seeds is an apt and attractive addition to any pantry, and makes an ideal gift 
for home bakers of all experience levels. Perhaps some stores would be content enough with these estimable 
aesthetic and culinary qualities, but since this is Trader Joe's, we've gone the additional step of making its value 
exceptional, too: while supplies last, you can pick up of a bottle of our Double Fold Vanilla Extract for a 
fraction of the price you'd pay for extracts of similar quality elsewhere.

If we could have come up with a more inclusive name for Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice, we definitely 
would have done so. It's not that we don't like the name; it's just that in some ways it strikes us as rather 
limiting. Then again, when you say ""Pumpkin Pie Spice,"" people generally know exactly what you're 
talking about, so, well, we're sticking with that name. Unless, of course, you have a better one.

Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice is a sweet, warm blend of cinnamon, ginger, citrus, nutmeg, cloves and 
just a hint of black pepper. It is, quite unsurprisingly, ideal for making pumpkin pie. It's also excellent 
sprinkled over things like sweet potatoes, Butternut Squash, and applesauce. Most retailers sell Pumpkin 
Pie Spice in smallish jars, figuring you don't need much. We sell it in a full-size, 1.8 ounce jar, because ours 
is so good we think you'll want to use it often. And though ours is larger than most, it's also less expensive. 
We're selling each jar for $1.99, every day. You'll find it in our spice section.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20906/11364.png","2.99","[""Fall Faves"",""Let's Bake!""]","[""Kosher""]",
"027042","Organic Cane Sugar","Inside the resealable zipper pouch you'll find only one ingredient - Organic evaporated Cane Sugar. Grown 
on sugar plantations by our suppliers, the sugar cane is cut by hand, then delivered to the mill where the juice 
is simply crushed from the cane. The evaporation process produces perfect sugar crystals, golden in color and 
rich in natural molasses flavor.

In this natural state, Sugar is sweeter and more flavorful than processed, refined, white sugar. And as baking 
season really gets underway, just think about how delicious your baked goods will taste when you use Trader 
Joe's Organic Sugar in place of the ""white stuff."" Use Trader Joe's Organic Cane Sugar in all things baked, ice 
creams, and candies. You'll even love it as a body, foot, or face exfoliant that you can scrub, eat and repeat! It 
smells delightful and works wonders. Still in need of further convincing? It's certified Kosher as well. Still need 
further convincing? It's a tremendous value for Organic Sugar at $3.49* for a two-pound resealable bag. You'll

Trader Joe's Mini Maple Flavored Marshmallows.

True to their moniker, our Mini Maple Flavored Marshmallows are both maple flavored and miniature in 
size. They're richly flavored with maple syrup and boast a sweet, caramelly aroma. Like our other magnificent

"053711","Pumpkin O's Cereal","In 2014, Pumpkin Season magic finally made its way into our venerable, grammatically-incorrect, pseudo-
eponymous, cereal. Trader Joe's Pumpkin O's are pumpkified Joe's O's. Round like pumpkins (rounder, actu-
ally) and fun like jack o'lanterns (maybe more fun, since you can eat them), Pumpkin O's are made exclusively 
for Trader Joe's by the same supplier that makes our original O's.

They're made with a blend of U.S.-grown whole grain brown rice and whole grain oats from Canada, and sweet-
ened with real cane sugar and brown cane sugar. Unlike some ""pumpkin flavored"" cereals you may find in other 
stores, these are made with actual pumpkin-the real deal!

A bit of cinnamon hints at pumpkin pie, so you may be tempted to top these with whipped cream. That would 
likely be beyond delicious. We think, though, that cold milk is the best partner for these O's, for breakfast, 
lunch, or even dinner. Or create a seasonal snack when you toss Pumpkin O's with TJ's Pumpkin Spiced Pump-
kin Seeds [sku 53559], and some of our Country Pumpkin Granola [sku 20686] for fresh take on trail mix.

"074465","Grilled Pitted Green Olives","Olives truly are one of the most fascinating fruits on the planet. Depending on the variety, they can have a near  
endlessly wide variety of flavors, ranging from peppery to nutty, grassy to tart, and everything in between. 
Some varieties, like Chalkidiki olives from Greece, have a buttery, savory flavor and firm texture that some 
describe as ""meaty."" Here's where things get really fascinating: as it turns out, one of the best ways to bring olives 
with that flavor/texture combo to their fullest expression is to grill them, more or less like you would meat on 
a skewer. And that's precisely what's been done to Trader Joe's Grilled Pitted Green Olives.

They're made for us by a supplier in Greece, who grows their own Chalkidiki olives in groves right by their 
packing facilities. After curing the Olives, they pit them, then place them on a hot grill until distinct, lined sear 
marks develop. These sear marks not only provide a nice bit of texture to each olive, but develop a deep, warm, 
Maillard reaction-based savoriness, too. A fascinating preparation for an already fascinating fruit, Trader Joe's 
Grilled Pitted Green Olives are superb as a standalone snack, a great option for garnishing salads, sandwiches, 
and savory cocktails, and a smart choice for cheese platters, antipasto plates, and charcuterie boards.

with a base of sweet, crunchy, rolled oats that have been flavored with savory, lightly salty peanut butter, and 
sprinkled with chunks of rich, dark chocolate, every splendid spoonful of this full-flavored Granola is like an 
edible tribute to this preeminent flavor partnership.

Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Chocolate Granola makes a superbly sweet and satisfying breakfast option, 
especially when enjoyed the time-tested way, in a bowl with milk or your favorite non-dairy alternative. 
Possibly more so than any of our other granolas (and we know that's saying a lot), this Granola's classically 
complementary mix of savory and sweet makes it a particuarly delicious choice for simply snacking by the 
handful. Of course, those same qualities make it an equally excellent option for sprinkling over cups of yogurt, 
lavishly layered parfaits, or even the occasional ice cream sundae.

"058871","Nutritional Yeast","Yeast may be fairly low on the food chain, but because of the creations it makes possible, we consider it a 
culinary superhero of sorts. A frosty mug of hoppy beer? Brought to you by yeast. A thick slice of freshly baked 
bread? Also brought to you by yeast. But there's another yeast, of arguably equal importance, of which you may 
not be aware. 

Trader Joe's Nutritional Yeast is produced by culturing active yeast with glucose (often beet molasses or 
sugarcane) for several days. The yeast is deactivated with heat, fortified with B vitamins, dried and packaged. 
The process results in golden flakes that provide 3 grams of protein and just 10 milligrams of sodium per 1 
tablespoon serving. Vegan, gluten free and Kosher (pareve), it's ready to be used as a savory condiment or key 
ingredient in all manner of dishes.

Thanks to the hit of cheesy umami flavor it provides, Nutritional Yeast is as versatile as it is tasty. Sprinkle it 
atop roasted broccoli, baked potatoes or popcorn. Toss with fresh kale leaves & olive oil and roast to make kale 
chips. Use it in place of dairy or meat-based broths to add richness to soups, stews, gravies-even oatmeal! It's 
also a must-have ingredient when whipping up a batch of vegan macaroni and cheese.

500 BCE. Over the course of its two-and-a-half-millennia-long legacy, chutney has taken many forms, 
incorporating ingredients as far ranging as eggplants, radishes, pumpkins, and peanuts. You might be most 
familiar with the tamarind, mint, or mango chutneys offered by restaurants that specialize in Indian and South 
Asian cuisine. It's the last of these that serves as the inspiration for Trader Joe's Sri Lankan Organic Mango 
Chutney, a simultaneously sweet, savory, and spicy spread that brings a captivatingly complex hit of flavor to 
everything from curries and charcuterie boards, to sandwiches and samosas, to roti wraps and roasted meats. 

Made for us by a supplier in Sri Lanka, this magnificently Mango-forward Chutney is made with a thick, yet 
smooth and spreadable base of organic cane sugar and organic coconut sap vinegar, to which our supplier 
adds big, toothsome chunks of organic mango. They then flavor each batch with a suite of awesomely aromatic

us to call them: Trader Joe's Tiny Fruity Cuties. Bonus: It's fun to say!

Our Tiny Fruity Cuties may cause you to reminisce about the fruity, hoopy cereals of your past, but the real 
tricks are not in the nostalgia. The cereal's delicious flavor profile and mindful makeup enable it to stand on its 
own. The corn and oat construction of these Cuties packs a serious crunch; and it's a crunch sustained even 
after they soak for some time in your milk bowl. Beyond this tasty texture, their sweet, citrusy flavor yields 
notes of tangy tangerine with whiffs of lemongrass.

We've achieved such a delicious profile using natural flavors. And the fun colors come from vegetable juices 
and annatto extract. All this colorful, cutie-fruitness may mask the fact that Trader Joe's Tiny Fruity Cuties 
are also enriched with essential vitamins and minerals to help start your day off right-which is not to imply 
that they're only a breakfast food. In fact, a bowl with your favorite milk is as fitting for a nighttime snack, as it 
is at the break of dawn-or by the handful in the middle of the day!

"056995","Raw Almond Butter Creamy No Salt","Our new Creamy Almond Butter is naked. It's just plain old almonds ground to perfection, happily basking in 
all their glory. These nuts are au naturale, with nary a salt grain to cover their nude, nutty bums.

Aside from the fact that our new Creamy Almond Butter has nothing added to it, it is also authentically raw, 
and by ""raw,"" we mean that these nuts have not been cooked. They were not toasted, roasted, or even ""lightly 
dried"" (which would basically amount to roasting). 

No cooking, no roasting, no drying, no salt, no added oils¿ no nothing. Or, more accurately, ""no something."" 
But, don't be confused. They are something. They are simply the finest almonds California has to offer, gently 
ground into a creamy, spreadable nut topping suitable for dressing up toast, muffins, bagels, celery sticks¿ 
just about anything other nude food that could benefit from a flavorful layer of Raw Creamy Almond Butter.

What we're trying to say here is that if you are looking for a nutt-naked spread with uninhibited flavor, you are 
going to find it right here inside our sixteen-ounce jar of Trader Joe's Raw Creamy Almond Butter. That jar 
is $7.99, and can be found on our grocery shelves, next to our modest collection of nut butters-the ones that 
are also very good, though slightly more self-conscious.

"052293","Crunchy Almond Butter Salted","We've been meeting the ascending demand for Almond Butter with our quality collection of Creamy, Salted 
Almond Butter; Creamy, No Salt Almond Butter; and Crunchy, No Salt Almond Butter.  Now, because our 
customers have been clambering, the odd man out is coming in. That is to say, we are bringing in Trader Joe's 
Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter to round out our offering.

Like its siblings, Trader Joe's Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter is crafted for us in Washington by nut butter 
masters (they've been in the business for more than 30 years). Their secret: premium, dry roasted, California-
grown almonds. The sweet richness of the nuts is revealed in the roasting. Then they're expertly ground into 
a creamy paste and mixed together with pieces of almond to add that dynamic, crave-able crunch. The only 
other ingredient that comes into play is salt, which subtly bolsters the almond flavor.  Its simplicity speaks to 
the caliber. 

Trader Joe's Crunchy, Salted Almond Butter is low in sodium; cholesterol free; and a good source of fiber 
and protein. Plus, it comes packaged in plastic, BPA-free jars, which are desirably light, less inclined to break, 
and readily recyclable. 

In spite of the soaring demand, as evidenced by the addition of yet another Almond Butter iteration, we con-
tinue to offer a down-to-earth price of $6.99 for each 16 ounce jar.

"026527","Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil","Tinned fish are having a major moment. From fancy ""sea-cuterie"" boards to sandwiches and salads, these little 
swimmers are making an appearance on menus everywhere. Long-time tinned fish fins, er, fans will tell you 
what we know to be true-Trader Joe's has been offering the best values on tinned fish for decades. Seriously. 
It's impossible to choose a TJ's tinned-fish favorite, so for brevity's sake, we'll focus on one we've fancied since 
1998, when it first appeared on our shelves-Trader Joe's Sardines in Olive Oil with Smoke Flavor, a.k.a. 
smoked sardines. 

Wild-caught off the coast of Portugal and Morocco, these bone-in, skin-on Sardines come fully cooked, lightly 
flavored with natural smoke flavor, and packed in pure olive oil-ready to eat straight out of the tin if you so 
choose. You can serve them on crackers, too. And fold them into pastas. And place them atop salads. You'll find 
these stupendously smoky Sardines in our grocery aisle.

"004892","Pure Grade A Maple Syrup","Around 2015, the maple syrup industry initiated a shift in its labeling. Before then, there were three ""grades"": 
A, B and C. The trouble was, while these grades simply referred to color and flavor, consumers often thought 
each letter had something to do with quality. To avoid confusion, a new system was created in which all maple 
syrups are called ""Grade A,"" followed by their specific color and flavor designation.

Here we have Trader Joe's 100% Maple Syrup - Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste (first presented in 2006 
under the old labeling system). This is the second lightest (both in color and flavor) of the four Grade A syrups. 
Its lightness is due, in part, to having been tapped mid-season. (Syrups start out lighter and become darker as 
the season progresses.) Given its particular qualities, this Maple Syrup works well for most eating occasions-
from pancake topping, to Old Fashioned sweetening.

We're selling each eight fluid-ounce bottle of Grade A Amber Color & Rich Taste 100% Maple Syrup for 
$4.99*. Find it in our grocery aisle.

"066402","Organic Vermont Maple Syrup","We sell a lot of maple syrup from Canada-and why not? So many quality syrups are derived from north-of-
the-border sap. But here in the U.S., Vermont is the place from which the most revered domestic maple syrup 
comes. Not counting occasional holiday offerings, we carry just one maple syrup from the Green Mountain 
state: Trader Joe's 100% Pure Vermont Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup [sku 95221]. Our Customers love the 
taste, but since it's conventional and comes in a rather large bottle (32 fl. oz.) we saw an opportunity to bring in 
another Vermont option that's organic and less of a commitment size-wise. 

Trader Joe's Organic Vermont Grade A Dark Color & Robust Taste Maple Syrup is that syrup. It's harvested 
late in the season, when the sap's sugar content is lower and water content is higher. The longer boiling period 
required to create the finished syrup results in the darker color and intense flavor. It's an impeccable pancake 
partner, and an ideal ingredient in maple-focused recipes as well. And, the eight-ounce bottle is on our shelves 
now and every day for $4.99*. That's an incredible value for an organic syrup from Vermont!

hiatus off our grocery shelves, and with an improved recipe, Trader Joe's Organic Midnight Moo Chocolate 
Syrup is here for the summer, and it's richer, more chocolatey, and more drizzle-able than ever!

Made from a base of organic cane sugar and organic cocoa powder, Midnight Moo  comes in a convenient

ice cream sundae, with plenty of chopped nuts, whipped cream, and warm Fleur de Sel Caramel Sauce [sku

"075722","Organic Spaghetti alla Chitarra Pasta","Quite pasta-bly the most famous noodle in the world, spaghetti is made a bit differently in the Italian region 
of Abruzzo, just east of Rome. Just like standard spaghetti, the Abruzzese version is long and thin, made with 
durum wheat semolina and water, but instead of having a rounded shape, this Spaghetti is uniquely square, 
and goes by the name Spaghetti alla Chitarra.

A Chitarra is a pasta tool with a wooden frame and metal wires tied end-to-end, resembling a guitar (or 
chitarra in Italian.) Traditionally, a sheet of pasta dough is laid on the wires and pushed through with the 
use of a rolling pin to create its shape. Our Italian supplier mimics this method with the use of a bronze die 
extruder, which not only delivers the requisite square shape, but also creates a rough exterior texture on each 
noodle, resulting in superb sauce-sticking capabilities. Combine those attributes with a short list of exceptional 
ingredients (our supplier mills their own organic durum wheat semolina), and you have Trader Joe's Organic 
Spaghetti alla Chitarra.

About nine minutes in boiling water produces pleasingly al dente pasta, ready to enjoy with your favorite sauce. 
We're partial to pairing this Spaghetti with a jar of Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce [sku 70839] or Cacio e 
Pepe Pasta Sauce [sku 70650], topped with a generous grating of Pecorino Romano [sku 18326].

"096761","Speculoos Cookie Butter","Just a few short years ago, ""cookie butter"" didn't really mean anything. On their own, the words had meaning, 
but together, not so much. These days, say ""cookie butter,"" and you're likely to be met with a smile, a hug, 
or maybe a playfully chastising ""Oh, I cannot stop eating that stuff!"" Not yet on the Trader Joe's Speculoos 
Cookie Butter Spread bandwagon? Allow us to convince you to jump on board and join the sweet, spiced, and 
oh-so-spreadable fun. 

Speculoos Cookie Butter Spread is, in the most simplistic terms, spreadable Speculoos cookies. Speculoos 
cookies are classic Belgian biscuits with great crunch, and a slightly caramelized, almost-but-not-quite-
gingerbread flavor. After the cookies are baked to a fabulous finish, they're crushed and mixed with vegetable 
oils and turned into a spread. It sort of resembles peanut butter in color and spreadability, but tastes like 
cookies instead of peanuts-amazing, right? Spread it on toast, bagels, pancakes or waffles. Use it as a dip for 
pretzels, Speculoos Cookies [sku 50236], or apple slices. Melt a bit in the microwave and pour it over ice cream. 
Or keep it really simple and just use it as a dip for a spoon.

This pasta shape (also known as Manfredine, or reginette), resembles miniature lasagna ribbons, and cooks up 
to a delightful al dente texture that easily transitions from lunch to dinner, and from hot, to cold, and even 
warm preparations. Mafalda Corta's visual grandeur, fantastic forkability, and tender bite elevate the classic 
Caprese salad base of this recipe from appealing appetizer to totally enticing entrée.

Trader Joe's Organic Mafalda Corta Pasta can be enjoyed with all manner of sauces and all kinds of 
preparations. Try it with thinly sliced mushrooms, minced garlic, shallots, and olive oil for a marvelous mafalda

Blueberry Preserves comes pretty close! Our supplier takes wild, organic blueberries, harvested from the 
Canadian Boreal Forest, and simmers them with organic cane sugar to complement their pleasantly tart and 
rich blueberry flavor. A bit of pectin is added to lend the sweet, slightly tangy Preserves a bit of body, ensuring 
supreme spreadability atop your carb of choice (it's especially good on toasted Braided & Sliced Brioche [sku 
71239]). Take an unexpected turn into savory territory by mixing some Preserves with an equal amount of 
chopped Hot & Sweet Jalapeños [sku 56688] and showcase the resulting relish on a turkey burger-the fruity & 
sweet-meets-heat vibe is irresistible. And of course, it'd be right at home as the ""J"" in a PB&J sandwich.

now doing with red lentils in 2017. We're talking about pasta. Yep. Our Organic Black Bean Rotini [56093] 
has been such a smashing success, we set out to discover if there were other legumes we could leverage into 
the pasta world. There are! We did! And the result is Trader Giotto's Organic Red Lentil Sedanini.

Sedanini is a tube-shaped pasta that's somewhere between elbows and penne, shape-wise. Flavor-wise, 
Organic Red Lentil Sedanini has no comparison. As much as the Organic Black Bean Rotini tastes like 
black beans, this one tastes like lentils. It eats, though, like pasta, and if you cook it according to the package 
directions (for about 5-6 minutes in boiling water), its texture is exactly al dente. Nutritionally, what these 
bean-based pastas offer is almost astonishing. This one, made with a single ingredient (organic red lentil 
flour), is packed with 13 grams of protein in every serving. That's impressive. And delicious. Pair it with our 
Organic Tomato Basil Marinara [10111] or a simple blend of olive oil, garlic, and grated cheese. If you're 
looking to change up your pasta patterns, this is a good place to start.

We're selling each 12 ounce bag of gluten free Organic Red Lentil Sedanini, imported from Italy, for $2.99,

"076116","Spicy Honey Sauce","When sweet and savory come together successfully, it's always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, 
specifically, that's an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately 
spiced Organic Spicy Honey Sauce [sku 69094]. However, it was difficult to source a steady supply; switching to 
a conventional honey base allows us to ensure consistent availability, and offer it in a larger format. Win-win!

This new iteriation of Trader Joe's Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic 
honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. It has the transformative 
power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones. From 
something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake [sku 
31185], a drizzling of Spicy Honey Sauce instantly gives anything it's added to an extra element of complexity. 
Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give it a go over freshly baked 
Organic Biscuits [sku 73768], air-fried Breaded Chicken Tenderloin Breasts [sku 88109], roasted veggies, or 
barbecued shrimp skewers for a bit of epicurean experimentation. Add some oomph to salad dressings, BBQ 
glazes, and marinades with a generous squeeze. And if you're really adventurous, you can even try it with 
pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into tequila- and rum-based cocktails. Magical, indeed.

"066314","Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract","Ever wonder what the ""Bourbon"" in Bourbon Vanilla Extract refers to? The alcohol content connection 
might make you think it has something to do with bourbon whiskey, but the truth is that the two are only 
indirectly related: both Bourbon County, the birthplace of bourbon whiskey, and Île Bourbon, an old name of 
an island where vanilla is famously harvested, are named for the House of Bourbon, the former ruling family 
of France.  In fact, only vanilla harvested from islands in the Indian Ocean, like Île Bourbon (now known as 
Réunion) can be called Bourbon Vanilla. And that's precisely what you'll find in each bottle of Trader Joe's 
Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract.

Bold, full-flavored, and grown using organic certified practices, this Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract is ideal for 
use in making your favorite baked goods, stirring into frostings or icings, or even dropping a bit into smoothies, 
pancake mixes, or oatmeal. Because it's made with pure Bourbon Vanilla, its intense vanilla aromatics and 
flavor are accompanied by a few finer, more delicate notes, like cream and even a bit of spice, making it a must-
have for veteran and neophyte home bakers alike. And since it's available at Trader Joe's, it's a pretty intense 
value, too: You can find four-ounce bottles of Organic Pure Bourbon Vanilla Extract in our Grocery aisles 
for $9.99*, every day.

"074709","Smoky & Hot Chile Powder","You might call paprika and chile powder two sides of the same peppery, piquant coin. While both are made 
with dried, ground peppers, paprika is typically made with a single, relatively milder varietal of pepper, and 
is usually crafted to emphasize one aspect of that pepper's flavor-sometimes it's sweet, sometimes it's super 
aromatic, and often, it's smoked. Chile powder, on the other hand, tends to be made with a wider variety of 
peppers, which are usually chosen for their heat level. When mixed together, as they often are in dishes like 
paella, chili, and shakshua, they express the whole of the pepper's potential. And when carefully balanced into 
a single spice blend, as they are in Trader Joe's Smoky & Hot Chile Powder, they create a highly versatile 
seasoning that brings a smoky, savory kick to dishes of all kinds.

Made with just the right ratio of smoked paprika and chile powder to create just the right ratio of smoke to 
heat, our Smoky & Hot Chile Powder is super handy for making savory soups, sauces, and stews, and nearly 
indispensable when creating homemade BBQ rubs and Cajun-style seasonings. It adds a remarkable depth of 
flavor when sprinkled over scrambled eggs, roasted veggies, or grilled seafood, and can take snack foods like 
popcorn and potato chips into an entirely new dimension. Here's a hot (and smoky!) tip: try mixing it with sour 
cream to make a fun and fiery crema for topping tacos.

among those named. In fact, our olive oils are consistently praised for their authenticity, their quality, and their 
overall value compared to competitors. We know it's not terribly humble of us to agree with these assessments, 
but alas, we do. Our olive oil rocks!

Among the selection, and one we're enjoying right now, is Trader Joe's Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil. 
In the bottle is cold-pressed oil from olives grown in Italy, Spain, Argentina, and Greece. The oil is carefully 
blended in Italy and shipped to the United States, where it is packed exclusively for us. This particular blend 
creates an Extra Virgin Olive Oil that's golden green in color, pleasantly pungent and slightly grassy, with 
fruity flavors and a peppery finish. It's a terrific all-around kitchen worker-great in salad dressings, pasta 
dishes, marinades, and sautéing.

"053441","Organic Creamy Peanut Butter Salted Valencia","Sometimes a product has a special something you can't quite pinpoint. But, in the case of peanut butter, we 
know exactly what makes it so good. It's the peanuts. Before you say, ""Duh, Trader Joe's,"" allow us to explain¿

All of our Organic Peanut Butters are made with Valencia peanuts, grown only in Texas and New Mexico. In 
contrast, most commercial peanut butters are made from Runner peanuts. Runners are widely cultivated and 
have a high yield, but they're just not as good tasting as Valencias. That's because Valencias are naturally sweet 
with an intense peanut flavor-eliminating the need to add any kind of sweeteners or flavor enhancers. Valen-
cias are so good, we use only two ingredients to make our Organic Creamy Salted Valencia Peanut Butter...
You guessed it: peanuts and salt!

Really, we think once you taste ours, you'll wonder how you ever got through this much of your life without it. 
You'll never want to be without it again, and at our price of $3.49 for a sixteen-ounce jar, you'll never have to 
be. 

(A note to ""natural"" peanut butter newbies: We don't use hydrogenated oils to solidify the peanut butter, so 
the natural oils will rise to the top of the jar. To easily blend your butter together, store a new jar in your fridge 
upside down. When you're ready to start enjoying it, turn it right side up, give it a quick stir and dig in!)

chickens and organic vegetables like celery, onions, and carrots. We have this Organic Free Range version as 
well as an Organic Low Sodium version [sku 87063]. They're virtually identical, except for the salt. Some folks 
like to have the option to add their own salt (or not), and others like to have it there when they start cooking. 
Both of our Organic Chicken Broth options add terrific flavor to basics like mashed potatoes or rice, and make 
great bases for sauces, gravies, and all kinds of soups. They both are gluten free (believe it or not, some broths 
have added gluten), and the Low Sodium version comes with a mere 50mg of sodium per serving.

So whether you're mashing potatoes, boiling rice or making a signature soup creation, you'll find a helping 
hand in Trader Joe's Organic Free Range Chicken Broth and Low Sodium Chicken Broth. They even come in

the whole thing is based on a simple case of mistaken translation. You see, in colloquial Mexican Spanish, the

"001465","Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Liter","Hippocrates called olive oil ""the great therapeutic."" Homer called it ""liquid gold."" For some, that's reason 
enough to slap on a high price tag and call it a day. Not for Trader Joe's. We work with an Italian supplier that 
blends some of the finest Extra Virgin Olive Oils from the Mediterranean countries of  Italy, Greece, Spain and/
or Tunisia to produce this delicately flavored, smooth oil. Ideal for sauteing, making salad dressing or drizzling 
over grilled veggies, at $6.49 for a 1 L bottle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil , this is an outstanding, pantry-staple 
value.

 ""Extra Virgin"": To qualify as Extra Virgin Olive Oil, the juice must come from the first pressing of olives. All 
Extra Virgin Olive Oil is categorized as ""cold pressed"" because no high heat (at levels that could degrade the oil) 
or chemicals are used to extract the juice.  In addition, the juice must meet certain levels in laboratory tasting 
for things like levels of peroxide and acidity. Extra Virgin Olive Oil must have no more than 0.8% acidity. And 
equally important, the juice must be deemed to have excellent flavor and odor.

"075289","Salmon Rub Seasoning Blend","As seasoned professionals in the seasoning blend game (if we do say so ourselves), we've learned a thing or two 
about what separates a good spice mix from a truly great spice mix. Number one on that list: a balanced blend 
of flavors that complements, rather than overpowers, whatever it's being added to. That's certainly what makes 
our Salmon Rub Seasoning Blend so great. Made with a base of brown sugar, and supported with seasonings 
like smoked paprika, dried thyme, kosher salt and black pepper, this Rub synergizes spectacularly well with a 
salmon fillet, while still allowing salmon's naturally mild flavor and buttery texture to take center stage.

With just a quick brush of olive oil and generous sprinkling of Trader Joe's Salmon Rub on a fresh fillet, you're 
ready to grill, bake, or air fry one seriously delicious piece of salmon. As it cooks, the Rub forms a sweet, 
savory, herby, and delicately smoky crust that also adds a nice pop of texture to every bite. And while we had 
salmon in mind while developing this Seasoning Blend, we definitely ought to mention that it pairs beautifully 
with practically any other protein. We recommend giving it a go on roast pork loin, pan-seared steak, grilled 
shrimp, stir-fried tempeh, or even your everyday roasted veggies.

tasting, versatile, incredibly delicious Pappardelle Pasta we tasted on a buying trip to Italy's famed Tuscany 
region. Pappardelle was on every menu, prepared in so many interesting ways. And then our traveling company 
returned home, and Pappardelle was elusive. So we challenged ourselves to find a Pappardelle option that was 
at least as good as what we'd enjoyed in Italy, one that we could offer our customers every day. We found what 
would become Trader Joe's Egg Pappardelle Pasta at an artisanal pasta purveyor in the Tuscany-like wine 
country of California's Sonoma County.

Like its Tuscan inspiration, Trader Joe's Egg Pappardelle is made with durum semolina flour and real Eggs. 
It's crafted by hand in small batches and dried slowly, at low temperatures, in classic Italian fashion. It's even 
packaged by hand, by real people (gasp!), who take this whole process very seriously. Try Egg Pappardelle 
with hearty sauces like TJ's Bolognese [sku 80852], as a side dish for short ribs or pot roast, or dressed simply 
with TJ's Extra Virgin Olive Oil [sku 01465] and TJ's Grated Parmesan Reggiano [sku 91611] and hint of lemon.

kitchen), yet still has a more or less universally accepted ""taste""-in this case, we're talking about that savory, 
garlicky, tomato-y flavor that immediately brings a fresh-from-the-oven pizza pie to mind. As both purveyors 
and avid appreciators of pizza ourselves, we got to thinking: wouldn't it be great if we could add those zesty, 
herb-y, unmistakeably pizza-y notes to all kinds of other foods, too? That's when we created Trader Joe's Pizza 
Sprinkle, a Seasoning Blend that provides the power of pizza in a conveniently Sprinkle-able form.

What's the secret? Our supplier makes each batch with a base of tomato powder and granulated garlic to evoke 
the flavor of tomato sauce, then finishes it with a suite of complementary herbs and spices like oregano, basil, 
and paprika to evoke a wide range of classic toppings. We recommend shaking it over hot french fries, roasted 
cauliflower, scrambled eggs, and creamy soups. Looking to bring a little pizza pizazz to your favorite snacks?

Trader Joe's Italian-Style Wedding Soup. 

But before you throw that bouquet into a crowd at the checkout line, this Soup doesn't actually have anything 
to do with weddings. In Italian, Wedding Soup is called ""minestra maritata,"" meaning marriage soup, referring 
to the way the flavors of the meat and vegetables harmoniously meld together, not because it's served at Italian 
weddings. Though, if we were throwing a wedding at Trader Joe's, we'd be happy to be served this soup. 

Our version has a flavorful chicken broth, with rich, beef meatballs, and a garden-worth of veggies, like kale, 
carrots, and onions. The flavor is intensified with Parmesan cheese, and for an extra dose of comfort, little 
pearls of pasta, called acini di pepe, in every bite-sounds worthy of a celebration to us! All you have to do is 
heat it up. We recommend serving it with a toasted Ciabatta Baguette [sku 96398].

A traditional ingredient in Japanese cuisine for more than a thousand years, it's making a highly anticipated

many fantastic, fermented foods, it has a complex flavor-a mix of savory, salty, and umami. Our supplier is

yield a delicate, umami flavor, making this a very versatile Miso. 

Most commonly used in savory preparations, White Miso adds depth to soups, sauces, and dressings. You 
can use it in marinades for meats, fish, and tofu, or as a dip for crudité. Because of its short ferment, it adds 
balance and pleasant dimension to baked goods, without making them too salty or savory. Miso chocolate chip

variety of culinary uses, and are an even greater value. Because part of our commitment to selling the best 
products for the best price is finding better products at a better price, whenever we can.

Both a higher quality and greater quantity of pepper for your money than our last version, our new Fire 
Roasted Red Peppers are made with an especially long variety of pepper, that our supplier roasts and packs 
whole in a simple solution of sea salt, water, and red wine vinegar. They're pleasantly firm in texture and have a 
delightfully robust roasted flavor (complete with occasional bits of char), along with a natural sweetness (with 
no added sugar, mind you) that makes them a prime companion for creamy cheeses and hearty proteins. We 
recommend using them to top pizzas, submarine sandwiches, or pita wraps, or slicing them into pieces for 
pairing with your next charcuterie plate or cheese board.

"073321","Sweet Picanté Peppers","It's not often that you find a food that sits on the intersections of sweet, peppery, tart, and creamy, all at once, 
but when you do, you know you've got something special. And that's exactly what we have with Trader Joe's 
Sweet Picanté Peppers with Creamy Cheese Filling. On their own, these crisp, perfectly pickled Picanté 
Peppers (try saying that three times, fast!) would be a delicious enough treat, with their balanced profile of 
peppery and sweet, but when you add the slightly tart notes and plush texture of the Cheese Filling inside, 
that's where things get taken to the next level. 

With all those intersections of flavors and textures, it should come as no surprise that these Peppers are 
remarkbly versatile: they can be enjoyed entirely on their own as an anytime snack, arranged on an antipasto 
platter or tapas spread as an appetizer, or as a topping on pizza. We also find that they're delicious when sliced 
and served on a sandwich, and great when used as agarnish for salads, or if you're particularly adventurous, 
plopped into a cocktail. How sweet (and peppery, and tart, and creamy) it is!

"062742","Thai Wheat Noodles","It's generally a smart idea to keep some noodles in your pantry. But if they're fully-cooked, ready-to-eat, and 
shelf-stable, too? Now that's really using your noodle. That's precisely the promise of Trader Joe's Thai Wheat 
Noodles, a three-pack of ready-to-use noodle packets that's as simple to eat as heat, serve, and enjoy. They're 
made for us, by scratch, by a supplier in Thailand, who cooks them to soft, chewy perfection, then vacuum-
seals them to keep them preserved at room temperature until the very moment you need them for a soup, 
curry, or stir-fry.

We're not kidding about the convenience factor on these Noodles: simply open up a packet, mix it into your 
dish, and you're good to go. Without all that extra time boiling and draining dried noodles, you can afford 
to experiment with oodles of other ingredients, like a chow-mein inspired stir fry spiced with Chili Onion 
Crunch [sku 62480], a cold noodle bowl flavored with sesame seeds and Crunchy Peanut Butter [sku 01488], 
or a savory soup spiked with Thai Style Red Curry Sauce [sku 57474]. When you're ready to explore, check out

"075418","Organic Apricot Preserves","Did you know? Apricots, along with apples, raspberries, cherries, and almonds, belong to the Rosaceae family 
of plants, meaning they share a common botanical ancestor with roses. That might partially explain why 
the members of our tasting panel were so utterly swept off their feet when they tried our Organic Apricot 
Preserves. Made with organic apricots and organic cane sugar, these Preserves couple the uniquely sweet and 
delicately tart flavor of its star stonefruit with a charmingly chunky texture that's ideal for spreading over toast, 
muffins, or freshly made pancakes. Altogether, it's a jam that's so joyfully juicy that it might just make you see 
the world through apricot-colored glasses.

An able companion for all kinds of breakfast-y baked goods, Trader Joe's Organic Apricot Preserves also 
serve splendidly in a savory context. We're particularly fond of them as an accompaniment to a cheese board, 
especially when lightly spread over a rich, full-flavored cheese like Roquefort [sku 89767], or mixed with creamy 
Chevre [sku 19751]. And when mixed with a bit of brown sugar, mustard, and orange liqueur, it makes an easy 
glaze for pork, poultry, and salmon. Everything's coming up apricots!

"068966","Truffle Oil Duo","A bottle of truffle oil can make all the difference between a delicious meal and a truly outstanding one. So you 
can imagine the kind of culinary adventures that are possible when you've got two bottles of truffle oil in tow! 
That's precisely what you'll find in every Trader Joe's Truffle Oil Duo, a convenient two-pack of olive oils, 
one flavored with black truffle, the other flavored with white truffle. They're made for us by a supplier in Italy, 
who grows their own truffles and uses an ingenious, rapid-drying process to help them retain as much of their 
uniquely earthy and umami flavor as possible before infusing them in Italian olive oil. Both Oils are delectable 
in distinct ways: the Olive Oil with Black Truffle is a little bolder and richer in flavor, while the Olive Oil with 
White Truffle leans a little more on the aromatic end, with delicate notes of savory garlic throughout.

Unlike most of the olive oils we sell, our Truffle Oil Duo isn't meant to be used for cooking, but rather is best 
employed as a finishing oil. For example, you might drizzle a bit of the Olive Oil with Black Truffle over a nice, 
seared ribeye steak, or a plate of fresh pasta to give either an extra bit of gastronomic oomph. For a touch of 
refinement, you might mix in a bit of our Olive Oil with White Truffle into a dish of scalloped potatoes, or over 
a home-cooked pizza. In either case, serious epicurean elevation is only a few drops away. Pick up a Trader 
Joe's Truffle Duo as a gift for the gourmet in your life - especially if that gourmet happens to be you.

"053741","Platinum Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena","Made using traditional methods and under extraordinarily exacting standards, Trader Joe's Platinum Aged 
Balsamic Vinegar is crafted for us in Modena, Italy, using the concentrated must of Trebbiano and Lambrusco 
grapes which were grown in the Reggio Emilia region. A small percentage of red wine vinegar is added, and it's 
aged for a minimum of three years in oak wood barrels (per its ""Invecchiato"" designation). According to the 
Protected Geographical Indication certification, this traditional vinegar-making process is carefully monitored 
by a group known as the Balsamic Consortium (who knew?), which strictly regulates every detail-from grape 
varietals, growing regions and how the grapes are grown, to aging methods and more. The result is a rich 
Balsamic Vinegar with viscous, honey-like texture and flavor that is richly sweet with a gentle line of acidity.

Its molasses-ness makes our Aged Balsamic Vinegar of Modena better for finishing than for cooking. Drizzle 
over roasted pork or grilled steak, eggplant, mushrooms or zucchini. Swirl over creamy butternut squash soup 
or asparagus risotto. Splash over strawberries or sliced plums to showcase fresh fruit flavor. Or partner with a 
fine extra virgin olive oil for dipping fresh, rustic bread slices.

"066036","Chocolate Peppermint Loaf & Baking MIx","Years ago, we carried a Chocolate Peppermint Cake Mix, and like so many Trader Joe's products, it eventually 
disappeared from our shelves, making space for newer, innovative products. In the spirit of full-disclosure, 
we've always second-guessed that decision, because, well, we love a good chocolate peppermint cake. Especially 
during the holiday season. So this year we set out to once again offer a mix featuring this flavor profile, and in 
the process, we developed a mix that not only makes cake, it makes cookies as well. Win!

Trader Joe's Chocolate Peppermint Loaf & Baking Mix bakes up rich, moist, and deeply chocolatey, with 
just the right amount of mint flavor to make your taste buds tingle. With a few quick additions, it makes a 
versatile loaf - serve it with whipped cream or ice cream for an even more satisfying experience. With a slightly 
different assortment of mix-ins, you can make Chocolate Peppermint Crackle Cookies that emerge from the 
oven looking snow-capped. These are irresistible! A single mix, two easy options, one great price. We're selling

"071879","Ginger Spread","Start spreading the news-Trader Joe's Ginger Spread is here to amp up, enliven, and add some pizzaz to every 
meal of the day! Made for us in Dundee, Scotland (home of the very first marmalade factory), this sensational 
Spread is crafted in small batches, traditional style, using copper kettles and a small list of ingredients (sugar, 
water, crystallized ginger, fruit pectin, ginger puree, lemon juice, and citric acid). What results is an awesomely 
zippy, zesty Spread with pungent Ginger flavor. 

Both sweet and spicy in flavor, our Ginger Spread lends itself to both sweet and savory applications. You can 
spread it on your morning toast or Crumpets [sku 14622] and swirl it into yogurt or oatmeal to wake your 
taste buds up in the morning. Try adding a couple tablespoons to Reduced Sodium Soy Sauce [sku 26426] and 
aromatics for a lip-smacking stir-fry-style sauce. It makes a glorious glaze atop pork chops and salmon-try 
warming it slightly and spooning it tableside. And we think it's a slam dunk with a scoop of French Vanilla Ice 
Cream [sku 78576] whenever a cool treat beckons.

"074632","Portuguese Flor de Sal","Similar to its French equivalent, Fleur de Sel, Trader Joe's Portuguese Flor de Sal is collected by hand, from 
a thin layer of salt crystals that form on the surface of the sea-it's a gentle process, unlike traditional sea salt 
harvesting methods that use machines. The Salt crystals are small, delicate, and flaky- the name means salt 
flower in Portuguese. This Salt contains more moisture than traditional sea salt. It's preserved in a ceramic 
crock and topped with a cork lid, which helps protect the crystals and keep them from drying out-it's a terrific 
vessel that makes this salt tremendously giftable, and also offers countless re-use options once you've enjoyed 
the contents.

Portuguese Flor de Sal can season all the dishes on your holiday table. It is especially nice as a finishing salt, 
atop a steak, buttery potatoes-really, you can enjoy it just about anywhere calling for good salt. To really 
highlight its exceptional, clean flavor, try adding a sprinkle of Flor de Sal to your desserts-it can heighten 
chocolate notes and help balance the sweetness. Plus, it adds a lovely crunchy texture.

"074409","Cracked Olive Salad","Almost all olives must go through a curing process before they're edible. Fresh, right-off-the-tree olives are 
full of an extremely bitter-tasting compound called oleuropein, which can be removed by submerging them 
in various kinds of solutions, or even just packing them in salt, for an extended period of time. In some cases, 
olive farmers prefer to ""crack"" their olives prior to curing, by smashing them just enough to allow the pit to be 
removed. These cracked olives, or olive schiacciate, as they're known in Italy, absorb more brine than an intact 
olive as they cure, developing a deeper flavor and softer texture. And when combined with a mix of pickled 
veggies, capers, and savory seasonings, as they are in Trader Joe's Cracked Olive Salad, they're nothing short 
of a cracking good time.

Equally able as an appetizer, condiment, or side, each jar of Trader Joe's Cracked Olive Salad is made with 
both green cracked olives and black pitted olives, capers, and a giardiniera-like mix of pickled cauliflower, 
carrots, celery, and red peppers, all suspended in oil that's been seasoned with herbs like oregano and parsley. 
It makes a great topping for an Italian beef or muffaletta sandwich, a terrific topping for practically any style of 
pizza, and serves spectacularly well with a charcuterie board or cheese plate. Personally, we like to simply enjoy 
it as is, as an antipasto-like side for pasta or spread over a nicely toasted crostini.

"099285","Solid White Albacore Tuna, Salt Added","Albacore is the most prized tuna with the lightest flesh: white with just a little pink. In fact, because of its light 
color, albacore is the only tuna that can technically be called ""white."" At Trader Joe's, we have an abundance of 
albacore options, all of which has been sustainably caught using circle hooks and nylon leads - this method of 
fishing reduces ""by-catch,"" which means it's much less likely that other fish and sea life will be gathered up in 
the catch. 

What you'll find on our grocery shelves is premium albacore, meaty in flavor and texture, packed in versatile, 
easy-to-use cans. Our Solid White Albacore Tuna In Water with Salt Added contains three ingredients: solid 
white tuna, water, and salt. The addition of salt means that each serving (equal to the whole can) contains 360 
milligrams of sodium (sodium is also naturally occurring in these saline water swimmers).

a pasta fan, and a TJ's shopper, you really do deserve the best possible pasta-and these fluffy little dumplings 
really deliver! We challenged our supplier in Italy to make a simple, and simply delicious, five-ingredient 
Gnocchi without additives, and they gnocch'd it out of the park! That simple recipe: potatoes and a blend of 
wheat and rice flours, with cultured dextrose and lactic acid to help preserve them. Because they don't require 
refrigeration, you can keep them on your pantry shelves for easy access when the Gnocchi craving strikes. 

Trader Joe's Gnocchi are soft, shelf stable, pillows of potato that require little effort to yield a tasty and 
comforting meal. Boil these beauties for about two minutes before bathing them in TJ's Cultured Salted Butter 
[sku 53720] with fresh TJ's Organic Sage [sku 76525] leaves for a luxuriously simple feast. Or skip the boiling

"057927","Herbes de Provence","As summer turns to fall, we turn on our ovens. We break out the roasting pans that lay dormant from May to 
August and dust off our favorite roast chicken and root veggie casserole recipes. But just how will we season our 
chickens and casseroles (and fish, and turkey, and vegetables) this fall and winter?  With Herbes de Provence, 
of course.

What is it, exactly? Herbes de Provence [ERB-duh-proh-VAHNS] is a mixture of herbs typical of the Provence 
region in the south of France. It wasn't commercially available as a ready-to-use blend under that name until 
the 1970's, and the specific herbs used in the blend can vary, as cooks choose different herbs to suit their taste. 
The blend in this jar, created exclusively for us in Florida, is comprised of thyme, marjoram, savory, rosemary, 
basil, sage and lavender, creating a savory, aromatic seasoning that can be used in a multitude of preparations.

So how, and when, can you use Herbes de Provence? It is usually added before or during cooking, often when 
oil is heating, which helps to draw out the aromatics and allow them to meld into the recipe. It lends a sense of 
elegance when roasted with vegetables, and provides a floral balance to savory roasted poultry or fish.  And of 
course, what would the classic Chicken Provençal be without this Provençal-inspired seasoning?

Our Herbes de Provence blend is packed in a wide-mouth 2.2 oz. jar, complete with a wooden spoon, so you 
can scoop as much as you need. And at $4.99, you can scoop one up for yourself, and a few extras as gifts for all 
the cooks on your shopping list this season!

that story, two wayward tots used them as a tool to keep track of their progress in the forest, only to find that 
birds had eaten them when they attempted to backtrack. What does this tell us about bread crumbs? If nothing 
else, they're much more delicious than they are a useful geolocational tool. Trader Joe's Organic Bread Crumbs 
are certainly delicious, and they're made with organic ingredients to boot. And they're definitely better suited 
for the kitchen than orienting yourself in the woods-just in case that was still on your mind. 

Whether you're in the mood for making fried fish, meatloaf, or a cheesy casserole, it's always an excellent idea 
to keep a pouch of our Organic Bread Crumbs on hand. They add much-needed body and texture to crab 
cakes, meatballs, and salmon patties, a delightfully crispy pop of texture when used to top baked mac and 
cheese, and make a superlatively delicious breading for pork cutlets, chicken cordon bleu, or air-fried pickles.

You might know him. He's a cute, yellow teddy bear - short and stout and wears a little red t-shirt, who has an 
endless love for honey. Something like ""Pinnie-the-Wooh"" sound familiar?

Oh, how he would adore Trader Joe's Multi-Floral and Clover Honey... so do we, and you will too! It's luscious, 
mildly sweet and amber-colored honey. We used to call this stuff simply ""Clover Honey,"" but the bees can 
pollinate & forage the nectar of whatever plants they choose. So, on account of the fact that a different species 
of flora could lure the bees out of their beloved clover fields from time to time, we've added ""Multi-Floral"" 
to its moniker. It's very similar to our 24-ounce Multi-Floral & Clover Honey [sku 47195], but this one is in a

"001437","Imported Olive Oil Packed in Italy","Perhaps the most widely-admired olive oils are those that carry the ""Extra Virgin"" designation. These oils tend

delivers a lighter-colored and more neutral-flavored oil.

Our Imported Olive Oil comes from olives that are harvested throughout some of Europe's best olive-growing 
regions - specifically, Italy, Greece, and Spain. The oil is packed in Italy, and shipped to your neighborhood 
Trader Joe's. Because the olive's flavors are less prominent, it's ideal for use in recipes calling for vegetable oil ,

"072471","Organic Italian Cascatelli Pasta","It's not every day that a new pasta shape comes along, so when one does, it's sure to make a splash. And what's 
better at making a splash than a waterfall? So named for the Italian word for ""little waterfall"", Cascatelli don't 
just resemble an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, they've become something of a phenomenon in their 
own right. An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food 
journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one 
can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a 
satisfyingly toothsome texture). Trader Joe's Organic Cascatelli, we're excited to tell you, passes all three tests 
with flying colors.

Made for us by a trusted organic pasta supplier, who worked directly with the shape's inventor to bring it into 
our stores, our Organic Cascatelli exceeded our tasting panel's lofty expectations. Their slightly curved shape 
and narrow, lasagna-like side ruffles give them a real edge in holding onto pestos and meaty ragus. They cook to 
a firm, yet yielding, texture, with a delectable, tender chewiness. And, indeed, they're much easier to hold with a 
fork than their longer, thinner counterparts. Try Trader Joe's Organic Cascatelli with plenty of Turkey Bolognese 
[sku 94161] or Pesto Rosso [sku 68135] to see just how much these three aspects make a difference. If you're 
anything like us, you'll immediately want to try it again with a few other sauces - just to be sure, of course.

"071648","Organic Pineapple Chunks","Each jar of Trader Joe's Organic Pineapple Chunks in Pineapple Juice contains exactly two ingredients: 
organic pineapple, cut into manageably sized segments, and sweet, organic pineapple juice. Both the pineapple 
and its juice come to us from Thailand, where pineapples are grown nearly year-round, and where they happen 
to produce some of the sweetest, highest quality pineapple our panel has ever tasted-and we've tasted quite 
a few. And though the ingredient list may be small, the flavors are anything but: ripe, well-rounded, and with 
only the faintest bit of acidity to keep things balanced, these Organic Pineapple Chunks will cover all your 
baking, grilling, stir-frying-or even just snacking-needs.

By packing these Chunks of Pineapple in their own juice, our supplier not only preseves their sweet, tropical 
flavor, but also keeps them super juicy and ready-to-eat, right out of the jar. In fact, one of our favorite uses 
for them is simply as a topping for yogurt, cottage cheese, or ice cream. Of course, they have plenty of savory 
applications, too, from pizza, to fried rice, to Thai curries, and more. And they're an especially convenient 
pantry item for making tropical salsas, fruit salads, and even cocktails when fresh pineapple is out of season.

"007850","Lemon Curd","If cheese is the only thing that comes to mind when you hear the term ""curd,"" it's time to expand your culinary 
horizons. Simply put, fruit curds are a category of preserves in a class of their own, made by cooking fruit juice 
with eggs and butter. Typically served with scones or bread as an alternative to jam, fruit curds are woven 
into British teatime tradition-which is why our Buyer went straight to the source to develop Trader Joe's 
Authentic Lemon Curd.

Our Authentic Lemon Curd is imported from England, where it's been made exclusively for us for nearly 15 
years. Cane sugar, whole eggs, and butter are slow-cooked in small batches with Sicilian lemon juice concentrate, 
lemon oil, and pectin; because the characteristics of the lemon juice can vary slightly from batch to batch, 
this labor-intensive process is overseen by a kettle master, whose sole purpose is to stir the curd and monitor 
its flavor, satiny texture, and vibrant sheen until it's just right. When the mixture cools, it transforms into a 
luxuriously thick, glossy, golden-yellow spread, imbued with the aroma of freshly baked lemon bars. Yum¿

With flavors of rich butter and sweet sugar contrasted by bright, tangy lemon, you might refer to our Lemon 
Curd as ""sunshine in a jar."" After all, a spoonful of the stuff has the power to brighten up breakfast, baked goods, 
and all sorts of sweets and treats in between. Slather it on toast or stir it into yogurt. Drizzle it on pancakes, or 
ice cream, or cheesecake. If you want to get fancy, whip up some heavy cream and fold it into the Lemon Curd 
for an almost-effortless tart or layer cake filling worthy of a royal afternoon tea. We're offering 10.5-ounce jars 
of Trader Joe's Authentic Lemon Curd for the sunny price of $2.99 each. Find them on our grocery shelves.","https://www.traderjoes.com/content/dam/trjo/products/m20903/07850.png","3.99","[""Brunch All Day"",""Cheese Board"",""Gild The Lily"",""Treat Yourself""]",,"[{""display_sequence"":0,""panel_id"":1,""panel_title"":"""",""serving_size"":""1 Tbsp.

"056688","Hot & Sweet Jalapeños","Most people know the famous tongue twister where Peter Piper picks a peck of pickled peppers. Well, thanks to 
a palatable new pepper offering, we've decided to reword it. ""Trader Joe's picked a peck of Hot & Sweet Jalape-
ños¿"" Sounds rather catchy, we think.  

The developers of our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños originally came upon a jar of candied jalapeños in Kansas City, 
Missouri. The concept piqued their interest but the peppers were just a little too sweet. So, for this product they 
concocted the perfect balance of sweetness to complement-but not overpower-the heat of the jalapeños. And, 
yes, these are spicy; they'll certainly pack the punch you'd expect from the small but mighty jalapeño. Grown 
in Mexico and Canada, the sliced jalapeños are pickled in a concoction of sugar, vinegar, salt, jalapeño puree, 
garlic, and a whole red chili pepper. The final result? A palatable, perfectly pickled-and sweet-pepper. 

Perplexed about how to put our Hot & Sweet Jalapeños to use? Pop 'em in your mouth like candy. Top a heap-
ing plate of nachos with several slices. Spice up a hamburger or grilled cheese. Add to guacamole. Serve with 
crackers and cream cheese. Place as a pickled accompaniment for charcuterie. And then, when the jalapeños are 
gone, use the brine for a marinade. The possibilities are plentiful!

Though we don't sell Trader Joe's Hot & Sweet Jalapenos by the peck (sorry, Peter), we do sell 12 ounce jars for 
the phenomenal price of $2.49. What a sweet deal for such a hot item.

"086161","Strawberry Yogurt O's","Trader Joe's Strawberry Yogurt O's are made with whole grains and pack a great crunch.  Heck, even without 
anything other than that, this would be a terrific cereal. What really makes Strawberry Yogurt O's stand out 
from the crowd is the addition of fruit and yogurt to the mix. Unlike some other cereals, ours are liberally 
coated with delicious yogurt - in a deliberately selective fashion, of course.  Some of the crispy O's are coated 
with yogurt; some are not. Some of the crunchy freeze-dried strawberries are coated with yogurt; some are 
not. Being fussy with the yogurt coating allows us to create cereal that's wonderfully crunchy and bursting 
vibrant flavors without being too sweet. It's a winner with milk for breakfast, and can be addictive as a snack 
right out of the box - trust us, we speak from experience.

"056662","Chile Lime Seasoning Blend","Fruta con chile y limon. It's a popular snack offered up by street vendors throughout Mexico. Wheeled carts 
mounted with glass boxes exhibit plastic cups, each one overflowing with one or another combination of fresh-
cut fruits and veggies-watermelon, mango, coconut, oranges, jicama, cucumbers¿ 

But it's not just fruit they're peddling. As important as the produce is, what makes this snack so special is the 
condiment sprinkled on top. It's a seasoning made from salt, chile powder, and lime juice powder. What might 
seem strange to the uninitiated is actually a very sensible (and sensational!) flavor fusion: sweet and crisp fruit, 
contrasted with tart lime, enhanced by salt, and given an ever-so-slight, pungent, chile-powder kick.

This seasoning has made its way to the U.S., and beyond. You can find it displayed prominently in Mexican 
market produce sections as Tajin®. Now, Trader Joe's is providing our own version of this simple seasoning; what 
we're calling Chile Lime Seasoning Blend. We decided to take the best qualities of the leading brand, and to 
improve what we could. For instance, our development panel agreed the U.S. version of Tajin® is too salty. Al-
though there is a low sodium version, it tastes rather bland. We decided to seek a salt level that would enhance, 
without tasting ""salty""... Check! In terms of the overall ingredient list, we exchanged the silicon dioxide in Tajin® 
for rice concentrate-a more desirable anti-caking agent. 

Trader Joe's Chile Lime Seasoning Blend is in our grocery aisle with the other spices and seasonings we offer. 
Look for the bright red label and cap. Also, look forward to paying $1.99 for the 2.9 ounce glass shaker.

"071299","Organic Vegetarian Chili","Chili is a hearty, filling meal that takes considerable time to create from scratch. For this reason alone, it's 
extremely convenient when it comes in a can, ready to heat and eat. We offer an assortment of canned chili, 
including Beef Chili with Beans [sku 17186], Turkey Chili with Beans [sku 47936], and until recently, a meatless 
version called Organic Vegtarian Chili [sku 50846]. 

This vegetarian version was a best-seller... until our supplier was no longer able to produce it for us. Seeing 
this as an innovation opportunity, we replaced the textured soy protein of the original version with textured 
pea protein. In line with the latest vegetarian trends, this change maintains the 'meaty' texture of the original 
version, while also making Trader Joe's Organic Vegetarian Chili (now, in a green can) available to customers 
who are avoiding soy.

Otherwise, the new iteration is similar to the previous recipe. It's still chock full of red beans and onions, with 
bell peppers, garlic, jalapeños, and seasonings that include chili powder, cumin, cayenne, and black pepper. 
Altogether, it's a zesty meal that makes meatless chili a satisfying choice for vegetarians and meat-eaters, alike!

other types of sweet and hot peppers that develop green at first. This mature pepper has more nutrients than green 
peppers (nine times the amount of carotene!), and because of their color, they contain the antioxidant lycopene. 

Knowing all the virtues of these fiery field treasures, you're probably itching to add them to your next pizza, 
sandwich, salad, or skewer. We don't blame you - sounds like a good idea to us, too. Especially if you pair them

eggs, butter, and milk), super delicious, versatile, and a really great value. Still, a number of customers noted 
that a yellow cake mix would be even better, with its unbeatable flexibility. We took those comments to heart 
and created Trader Joe's Yellow Cake & Baking Mix.

Our Yellow Cake & Baking Mix is definitely easy to use. If you're making a standard 9x13 sheet cake, you 
simply grease your pan, whisk the contents of the Cake Mix together with 2 large eggs, 1 stick of melted butter, 
and 1 cup of milk, then bake! The result is moist cake that is noticeably richer than our Vanilla Cake because of 
the egg yolks included in the Mix's ingredients. When it comes to versatility, there's almost nothing you can't 
do with our Yellow Cake Mix. Make cupcakes, cookies, fruit-flavored cakes, bundt cakes, layer cakes, Tres

And if its ease, flavor, and versatility are not enough to convince you, consider the value: our 16-ounce package

"071254","Organic Red Wine Vinegar","Since time immemorial, pretty much any culture that developed any kind of wine acquired a taste for vinegar  
shortly thereafter. This is particularly true of the Mediterranean region, where grape-derived vinegars became 
a staple of cuisines across Egypt, Greece, and Rome thousands of years ago, and remain so to this day. With 
Trader Joe's Organic Red Wine Vinegar, we proudly carry on this ancient culinary tradition with a tart, fruity 
vinegar from Italy, which our supplier makes from organic red wine, then brings to an acidity level of 5% - 
ideal for bringing out a bright, cheek-tickling sharpness to salad dressings, sauces, and dishes of all kinds.

From the elegantly simple - like mixing with olive oil and herbs for a quick vinaigrette - to the daringly 
complex - like incorporating into a reduction to braise a tender lamb shank - this Organic Red Wine 
Vinegar is up to the task. Try adding it to marinades, where its nimble acidity will help tenderize the meat, 
mignonette sauces, where its tartness will wake up the natural flavors of shellfish, or gremolatas, where its 
fruity aroma will compliment the savory sensations of herbs and garlic.

"099069","Organic Diced & Fire Roasted Tomatoes with Green Chiles","Canned tomatoes rank high on our list of pantry essentials. To add extra complexity and depth to dishes, we 
like to keep on hand our Organic Diced & Fire Roasted Tomatoes with Organic Green Chiles. 

Before being diced and canned, vine-ripened organic tomatoes are charred over a flame, which surfaces the 
natural tomato sweetness and shares a striking smokiness. Organic diced green chiles further punch up the 
flavor with spicy heat. The layers of smoke and spice make our Organic Diced & Fire Roasted Tomatoes with 
Organic Green Chiles ideal for crafting salsas or sauces.  Mix together a can of these flavorful tomatoes with 
a can of corn and a can of our black beans for a take on a cowboy-style caviar. Or use a can for the base of a

"072968","Blueberry Muffin Mix","Whether you're looking for a comforting breakfast, a mid-morning coffee companion, or an afternoon snack, a 
homemade blueberry muffin is hard to beat. Making them from scratch, however, is not always an option-so 
what's a muffin maven to do? Keep a box of Trader Joe's Blueberry Muffin Mix on hand, that's what!

This masterful Mix brings you that much closer to a fresh batch of Blueberry Muffins, offering consistent, 
from-scratch flavor without all the measuring the from-scratch process usually entails. After countless trials of 
careful taste-testing (a tough job, we know), the tasting panel determined that freeze-dried Blueberries, 
when rehydrated and stirred into the batter, were far superior in flavor and texture than regular dried 
blueberries in the finished Muffins, and almost indistinguishable from their fresh counterparts-so we've 
included them in the box! You supply the refrigerated staples (butter, eggs, and milk or non-dairy beverage of 
choice), apply a bit of elbow grease, and you'll end up with 12, generously-sized, enjoyably sweet Blueberry 
Muffins, with a tender crumb that's studded with plenty of blueberries throughout. Keep a box on hand for 
breakfast, brunch, and snacks (oh my!), and you'll never be caught unawares when the craving strikes!

"025122","Jumbo Pitted Greek Kalamata Olives","Kalamata Olives are among the world's most prized olives. There are many imitators, calling themselves 
""Kalamata Style,"" but the real thing is found only in a small region in Greece. Their harvest is subject to varying 
climate conditions - some years the harvest is great and other years, not so much. While prices around the 
world continue to rise, our relationship with our supplier is so solid, that we've been able to hold the same great 
price for a decade! 

Trader Joe's Jumbo Pitted Greek Kalamata Olives are dark, eggplant colored olives that are ripened on the

iconic, luxury sports cars; it's also home to Aceto Balsamico di Modena. Prized for its wooden barrel aging 
process and rich, complex flavor, all vinegar produced in this region bears a seal of authenticity, in this case, 
IGP (Protected Geographical Indication) to help protect shoppers against lower quality, imitation products-a 
seal you can find on all Trader Joe's seasonal and everyday offerings of balsamico. 

The newest addition to our flavor-boosting condiment family is Trader Joe's Organic Balsamic Vinegar of 
Modena. This Balsamic is made with certified organic ingredients-cooked grape must and wine vinegar-
that lend themselves to a sweet, viscous, and smooth Balsamic Vinegar with notes of raisin and oak, it pairs 
tremendously well with savory and sweet dishes alike-combine with olive oil for a simple vinaigrette for a 
caprese salad, or drizzle over a scoop of TJ's French Vanilla Ice Cream [78576] for a delectable dessert. And 
because a little goes a long way, try dotting strawberries or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese with our Organic 
Balsamic for an extraordinarily flavorful bite.

a simple mix of ingredients, including rolled oats, sugar, cocoa powder, sea salt, and other natural flavors, this 
Instant Oatmeal is a sure-fire way to start your day on a decidedly delicious note.

Of course, in order to enjoy all the important aspects of a breakfast treat like this, it's important that you actually 
have time to put it all together. That's where our Cocoa & Sea Salt Instant Oatmeal really excels: in just a 
matter of minutes, either with a microwave or hot water from a kettle, this Instant Oatmeal becomes thick, 
steamy, and hearty, with a satisfying chewiness from the oats themselves. It's the ideal textural complement to

It generally involves spending long hours in the kitchen, plenty of chopping and dicing, copious amounts of 
stirring, and did we mention long hours standing in the kitchen? If you have the time on your hands, we're all 
for homemade. We love homemade. But if, like us, you don't always have the time, we have some homey fully-
cooked-and-ready-to-heat soups that will warm you inside and out.

One of our favorites is Trader Joe's Organic Tomato & Roasted Red Pepper Soup. It's a velvety smooth 
concoction with a subtle tomato base. Its depth of character comes from the flavorful spices and the slightly 
sweet finish is courtesy of the Roasted red bell peppers. You can serve it as is, or add big chunks of veggies 
and some beans to make it even heartier. A dollop of sour cream or crème fraîche never hurts. You'll find each

surprised us that the ""big names"" in peanut butter add all kinds of sweeteners and additives - simple really is 
better. Trader Joe's Creamy Salted Peanut Butter is simple, and simply scrumptious. There are two ingredients 
inside every jar: peanuts and salt. That is all. 

Using peanuts from the southeastern United States, our supplier produces Trader Joe's Creamy Salted Peanut 
Butter exclusively for us in Georgia. The peanuts are dry roasted and ground with the skins still on - this 
really enhances the flavor of the finished peanut butter. Unlike some other peanut butters with added partially 
hydrogenated oils, ours does not solidify - the oils do separate from the solids. A quick stir, and refrigeration 
after opening, are all you need to rectify this. For your ""trouble,"" you're rewarded with peanut butter that 
actually tastes like... peanuts! It's a wonderful thing to taste. Make a classic PB&J, or take a cue from Elvis and 
swap the jelly for bananas and bacon. If you have a taste for Hemingway, try tasting it the way Papa did, paired 
with thick onion slices.

"072525","Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati Pasta","Sometimes, one can only be satiated by a bowl of really good pasta. Trader Joe's Organic Fusilli Corti Bucati 
Pasta is one such majestic macaroni. What makes this noodle noteworthy? It starts with the Italian pasta 
maker sourcing high quality, organic, and local durum wheat semolina, then going the extra mile to mill the 
flour themselves. High quality tools are equally essential  -bronze coated shaping disks are used to produce 
thick, textured noodles that deliver a perfectly al dente texture that help support the heftiness of its partnered 
sauce while maintaining a delicate chew.

You may be familiar with Fusilli-the spirals that have filled our shelves and stomachs for years. But these Fusilli 
are distinctly different. In Italian, ""Corti"" means short and ""Bucati"" translates to ""with a hole"". Each bite-size 
noodle is corkscrew shaped, with a hollow center that makes for an immensely exciting eating experience. Pair 
it with a hearty bolognese sauce and be in awe of how much sauce clings to each noodle, while never feeling 
weighed down. Serve it hot or cold, in a vegetable soup, a pasta salad, or with your favorite TJ's pasta sauce.

profile, allowing the stronger flavors the sauces that typically accompany them to shine through. But making 
pappardelle from scratch can be a drawn-out, labor-intensive affair. That's precisely where Trader Joe's Organic 
Pappardelle Pasta Nests come in.

They're brought to us by one of the most highly-regarded pasta makers in Italy, who doesn't just put in the hard 
work of crafting each batch of Pappardelle Pasta Nests into the tender, delectable noodles that they are - they 
also mill their very own local, organic, durum semolina wheat to do so. They then divide them into easily-
portioned, dry bundles to make at-home preparation a breeze: simply cook two to three Nests per person in 
boiling water for 12 to 13 minutes, then drain. From there, you're free to toss them in your favorite sauce-we 
tend to prefer something creamy and savory, like our Cacio E Pepe Sauce [sku70650]-and save the Nests you 
don't use for another dinner, another day. Trader Joe's Pappardelle Pasta Nests are convenient, delicious, and

"071109","Kitchari","We're ardent appreciators of comfort foods, here at Trader Joe's, and kitchari may just be the mother of them 
all. As a traditional dish with thousands of years of history, kitchari has inspired litreally countless regional 
variations and individual family recipes across India and the globe, but one constant ties them all together: 
a comfy, cozy mix of grains, veggies, and delicately savory seasonings that leaves you feeling full, your 
palate feeling pleased, and your stomach feeling settled. With Trader Joe's Kitchari, we pay tribute to this 
consummately comforting porridge by offering it in a super simple, ready-in-a-matter-of-minutes format that's 
as easy as heat, serve, and enjoy.

Brought to us by the same supplier in India who makes our other Indian Fare pouches, Trader Joe's Kitchari 
is made with a mix of amaranth, oats, brown rice, and millet, as well as a bit of split mung bean to add a rich, 
satisfying nuttiness to the proceedings. Each spoonful is hearty and delicious, with chunks of carrot, pumpkin, 
and peas, which provide both textural variation and a light, gentle sweetness. This Kitchari can be enjoyed for 
any meal, any time of year, but it particularly shines on days when you're feeling a little blah and could use a

to search the culinary seas for an organic counterpart. Once we found one-and once we realized it wouldn't

Shelled Hemp Seeds!

Like our previous version, these are Just the Hemp Hearts, meaning they've been hulled to remove the fibrous 
shell. Though removing the shell does mean less fiber than one might find in other so-called ""super seeds,"" such 
as flax or chia, it also means these Seeds make it easier for your body to digest and absorb the nutrients. This is 
very good news, since our Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds are packed with plant-based protein (10 grams per 3 
Tbsp. serving), and also abundant with Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.

Seeds sans shell also allows a texture that is soft and chewy. This, combined with their fresh, nutty flavor, makes 
for a pleasant profile that complements a plethora of foods, including yogurt, oatmeal, salads, smoothies, dips, 
and more! Now, doesn't that supersede your expectations?

with a supplier to develop an even better version. Just like its previous incarnation, this Trader Joe's Organic 
Lentil Vegetable Soup is vegan and organic, but this time, it's gluten free, too. And if that weren't enough, it's 
even more savory and satisfying - our best Lentil Vegetable Soup yet, if we do say so ourselves.

Made from a simple, yet elegant, recipe of organic potatoes, onions, carrots, spinach, green beans, and lentils, 
slowly simmered in a rich, organic tomato-based broth, this Soup has a comfy, homey flavor and a lovely mix 
of tender, toothsome textures. It's as simple to prepare as pouring into a saucepan and heating until steamy, and

for a Mediterranean-style meal. Add some fresh, chopped, Organic Persian Cucumbers [sku 91838], halved 
Organic Cherry Tomatoes [sku 12155], and Organic Riced Cauliflower [sku 54541], if you like. Use these Greek

"059941","Organic White Quinoa","Farmers harvest Trader Joe's White Quinoa in May at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, then they carefully 
wash, rinse, dry, clean again and sort the crop by color, before packing it to ship to our stores. Organic White 
Quinoa is a protein rich alternative to rice, couscous or pasta and is gluten free. This ancient grain has more 
than 5,000 years of history, and was so prized by the ancient Incas that it earned the designation ""the mother 
grain."" Unlike most grains, Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids in a 
balanced protein. It is often cited as one of the best protein sources in the vegetable kingdom.

Use Organic White Quinoa like you'd use rice. It's that easy, and it cooks faster, too. Combine it with black 
beans, corn, avocado and a bit of freshly squeezed lime juice for a quick, light, satisfying salad. You'll find each 
16-ounce resealable bag in our grocery aisle.

"072058","Organic Split Pea Soup","For years, we carried a dependably delicious Organic Split Pea Soup [sku 96046] in a carton on our grocery 
shelves. It was rich, thick, and flavorful - everything a good split pea soup should be. But we couldn't help 
but wonder: what if we brought in something even better? In the spirit of kaizen, the Sino-Japanese ethos of 
constant, incremental improvement, we rolled up our sleeves and began working with a supplier to develop 
an even more delicious version of Trader Joe's Organic Split Pea Soup. Just like the old version, it's vegan and 
organic. Unlike the old version, it's also gluten free and kosher (pareve). And it's tastier, heartier, and more 
satisfying than any split pea soup we've ever carried before.

Taking inspiration from an iconic split pea recipe, this Soup is made with just a handful of organic ingredients, 
including onions, carrots, celery, garlic purée, and, of course, organic split peas (they're the first listed ingredient, 
in fact!). Each spoonful is tremendously thick in texture and scrumptiously full-flavored - a perfect soup for 
making you feel warm and cozy from the inside out. For a quick dinner or lunch, it can be enjoyed with a 
sandwich on the side, or all on its own, topped with something crunchy and delicious like garlicky croutons or 
Crispy Jalapeño Pieces [sku 63959].

"070185","Calrose Rice","So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference  
just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained 
varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you'd find in a typical 
fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you'd expect to find in 
risotto or paella. Trader Joe's Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it's elegantly soft and 
fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease - the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round 
out our rice selection.

First developed in California in the late 1940s, Calrose Rice has since become one of the more popular rice 
varietals in the world, and by far the most widely grown varietal in California. After tasting it, it's easy to see 
why: with its mild flavor and sticky texture, it takes on sauces and seasonings beautifully, without sacrificing 
any of its satisfying starchiness. Try it out with our classic Mandarin Orange Chicken [sku 66563] and you'll see 
exactly what we mean. Check out 32-ounce bags of Trader Joe's Calrose Rice, available in our grocery aisle.

"020429","Spanish Manzanilla Olives with Pimento Paste","When you imagine an olive, what do you see? A green, elliptical orb with orange stuffing peeking out the sides, 
likely skewered on a toothpick and adorning a martini? That orb is a Manzanilla Olive, the most recognizable 
variety and star of Trader Joe's Spanish Manzanilla Olives with Pimento Paste.

Common though they may be, there's nothing pedestrian about these olives. Grown and processed in their 
native Spain, the Olives are plump and meaty, with balanced salinity and bitter notes. The pits are removed to 
make way for a sweet and mildly spicy Pimento Paste that complements the Olives' briny and piquant profile.

It goes without saying that Manzanilla Olives take martinis from good to iconic. Shake (or stir) a Spanish-
style dirty martini featuring your gin of choice, sherry, white vermouth, a touch of Olive juice from the jar, 
and skewered Olives as garnish. And why stop the Spanish homage there? Serve a handful of Olives alongisde 
Daniele Spanish Brand Deli Selection [sku 96370], Manchego Cheese [sku 33331], and Truffle Marcona Almonds

"070397","Green & Red Hatch Chile Flakes","It's hard to overstate the importance of red and green chiles to New Mexican cuisine - there's an argument to 
be made that red and green chiles are, in fact, the foundation of New Mexican cuisine. After all, New Mexico's 
state question (apparently, there are such things as state questions), ""red or green?"", is a direct reference to their 
ubiquity in restaurant settings. In honor of these chiles' special place in Southwestern cooking, we're proudly 
introducing Trader Joe's Green & Red Hatch Chile Flakes to our shelves, so that their spicy, singularly New 
Mexican flavor can be enjoyed at home in dishes of all kinds - no matter which state your home happens to be in.

Of course, these aren't just any chiles: these are dried Hatch Chiles, from New Mexico's renowned Hatch Valley. 
Widely praised for their unique, savory taste (some detect notes of onion or garlic in their flavor profile), these 
Green & Red Hatch Chiles are especially great for adding heat and depth to taco meat, enchilada sauces, chilis, 
or stews. And since each jar contains both Red and Green Flakes, you get the benefits of each: both the round, 
slightly sweeter flavor of the more ripened Red, and the sharper, more vegetal flavor of the younger Green. Try 
folding them into your next burger for a nice, peppery kick.

"061497","Gingerbread Cake & Cookie Mix","In centuries past, the Bard's lone penny wouldn't have helped you much. There was a time when you needed to 
be wealthy, or at least pretty well connected, to get your hands on cakes made with ginger. You might have had 
to sail across vast oceans or haggle with a well-armed soldier to get that ginger fix. Thankfully, that's no longer 
the case, because Trader Joe's new and improved Gingerbread Cake Mix has landed for the season.

Trader Joe's Gingerbread Cake Mix is a cockle-warming blend of quality ingredients like molasses powder, 
cinnamon, nutmeg and-best of all-real crystallized ginger pieces.  It's a cinch to whip up-simply mix (with 
oil, water, and an egg), stir, pour, and bake. Told you-easy as pie! Or, rather, easy as cake. Unlike the mild 
mixes we've encountered elsewhere, ours is rich with bold, old-fashioned ginger flavor-a beguiling, blissful 
experience for the ginger lover. Our supplier sources their ginger from Fiji (known for producing some of the 
finest ginger in the world), and the mix is fully compliant with California's Prop 65, so we are thrilled to be able 
to sell it in all Trader Joe's stores. 

Make your list, check it twice, and don't forget the Gingerbread Cake Mix. It may be a little bit naughty (it is 
cake, after all), but it's really nice.  Especially at the price of $2.79 for a 14-ounce box. If gingerbread is really 
your thing, you might consider stocking up-we only bring this in for the holiday season, and when it's gone, it 
won't be back until next year. You'll find it in our grocery aisle.

"066549","Peppermint Mini Marshmallows","Perhaps you've noticed there's a method to the madness of how we manage our marshmallows. In the summer 
(a.k.a. s'mores season), we offer full-size 'mallows. In the fall & winter, we make 'em into mini 'mallows, meaning 
they're ideal for baking, and, most importantly, hot cocoa. This year, we're adding a third option, one that will, 
for a brief period of time, co-exist with our existing Mini Marshmallows [sku 57620], yet offer a decidedly 
different level of delight: Trader Joe's Peppermint Mini Marshmallows.

True to their moniker, TJ's Peppermint Mini Marshmallows are both peppermint-flavored and miniature in 
size. They're gluten free, gelatin free, vegan, and kosher (pareve), just like their 'mallow mates. They're flavored 
with real peppermint oil, and their light pink hue comes courtesy of vegetable juice. Add them to holiday-
themed s'mores, a festive batch of crisp rice treats, or a steaming mug of TJ's Peppermint Hot Chocolate [sku

of this particular pasta. Still, the mere thought of even larger fusilli than Trader Joe's Quite Possibly The 
World's Largest Fusilli leaves us with countless questions - specifically, how on earth would one get the 
pieces in one's mouth?  Yes, dear readers, these are the topics that cause sleepless nights here at Trader Joe's. 

Lest you think only size matters here, we can attest that everything else about this artisan pasta is pretty close 
to perfetto. It's made in Italy with durum wheat semolina, as tradition dictates, so each bite delivers classic, 
Italian pasta flavor, and, when cooked al dente, tantalizingly toothsome texture. The titanic, twisty shape is 
terrific for catching and delivering whatever sauce you have in mind. Maybe a likewise limited offering like 
our TJ's Truffle Picante Pasta Sauce [sku 71835]?

"067160","Ground Fermented Black Garlic","There's some serious science behind the fermentation process that leaves fermented garlic as black, soft, and 
surprisingly sweet as it is. When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, the allicin within fresh 
garlic - i.e., the chemical that gives garlic its uniquely pungent flavor and aroma - begins to break down 
into S-allylcysteine, a compound that turns the whitish garlic cloves black, gives them a soft, jelly-like texture, 
and converts that distinctly garlicky flavor into something sweeter, richer, and more complex. Intrigued? We 
can't blame you. Luckily, with Trader Joe's Ground Fermented Black Garlic, it's never been easier to add this 
extraordinary flavor to whatever dish strikes your fancy. 

A long-standing staple of culinary traditions all across the Asian continent, Fermented Black Garlic makes 
an excellent addition to even the simplest of foods: soups, roasted potatoes, grilled meats, marinades, even 
a pot of simple stove top mac & cheese becomes an elevated eating experience with a few dashes of Ground 
Fermented Black Garlic. In true Trader Joe's tradition, the price remains decidedly unelevated: we're selling 
1.02-ounce jars of Trader Joe's Ground Fermented Black Garlic for $2.99*, every day. Look for them with our

counter winter's chill.

Each box of Mix comes complete with conveniently pre-measured packets of yeast and Herbs & Sea Salt to

specialty sea salt-but one that is definitely very special: Trader Joe's Wine Infused Sea Salt Seasoning.

Our South African supplier fills the large, clear Grinder with sea salt that's infused with locally produced rosé 
wine from the Western Cape. Pink peppercorns and dried rosemary join the salt to create a Seasoning, which 
is both fun to use and impressive display.

This Wine Infused Sea Salt is especially nice on poultry or seafood, but you can enjoy it with just about 
anything. You might even open up the top and pour some out to use as a rub, or as a larger format finishing 
salt. And as a bonus, this Grinder's large size and see-through packaging mean it looks pretty sitting on your

"058214","Organic Free Range Chicken Stock","Stock or broth, broth or stock? It's an age-old question, nearly as asked as whether the chicken or the egg came 
first, or what truly is better than sliced bread. With meat-based broths and stocks, it's a matter of the amount of 
meat-to-bone ratio. Broths include meat during cooking, while stocks rely strictly on bones for flavor. 

Stocks are made to add flavor to recipes, and that's exactly what Trader Joe's Organic Chicken Stock will do. 
Organic free range chicken and sea salt are the building blocks of this Stock. Celery juice, roasted onion flavor, 
and carrot juice add an extra bit of flavor that truly boosts this into the realm of delicious stocks. The long sim-
mering results in a rich liquid that's full of flavor and ready for use.

Thanks to stock's versatility, you can use our Chicken Stock for so. Many. Things. Use it instead of water to cook 
grains like Tricolor Quinoa [sku 96689], 10 Minute Farro [sku 94506], 10 Minute Barley [sku 94497], or Israeli 
Couscous [sku 92835]. Make a pan sauce after cooking pork chops or steaks. It makes a great base for soups 
(chicken noodle, dumpling, pot pie, tortilla¿) or stews, and works in a pinch when finishing up that holiday 
stuffing.

since your oven is likely already stuffed with other stuff. It's seasoned with traditional poultry spices-such as 
oregano and sage-along with other familiar flavors, like chicken broth, onion, celery, garlic, and mushrooms.

So, what differentiates this duo? The contrast is in the croutons! While our classic Cornbread Stuffing is made

ideal for roasting over a roaring campfire and stacking into s'mores, their generous size makes it a bit difficult to 
pile them into a cup of hot cocoa. Enter Trader Joe's Mini Marshmallows.

Think of these sweet, dainty clouds as the miniature cousins of our existing Marshmallows - you can expect 
the same combination of chewy, fluffy vanilla-y goodness in every handful. And because they are packed in 
our private label, you can be assured they are free from artificial flavors, added colors and GMO ingredients 
(which cannot be said for most other brands). They are also gluten free and... drumroll, please... gelatin free! If 
you follow a vegan or kosher diet, you know this is special - it's nearly impossible to find marshmallows made 
without gelatin, and if you do, they typically cost an arm and a marshmallow-man-sized leg. 

Make a Mini Marshmallow mountain atop a cup of Sipping Chocolate [88861]. Bake them in a sweet potato

"070355","Organic Tricolor Spaghetti","Great pasta is like a great work of art: it should stimulate the senses, express bold ideas, and open your mind to 
new possibilities. And in the case of artfully crafted works like our Organic Tricolor Spaghetti, it should do so 
with a vivid array of colors at its disposal. Made especially for us by the same supplier as our mutli-hued Organic 
Vegetable Radiatore [sku 36287], Trader Joe's Organic Tricolor Spaghetti is made from organic semolina in 
three distinct shades: traditional ""pasta yellow,"" bold orange-red (courtesy of organic tomato powder), and 
olive green (courtesy of organic spinach powder). Once cooked, it offers all the same toothsome, sauce-holding 
texture as our Organic Spaghetti [sku 78011], just with a distinctly polychromatic flair.

Use Trader Joe's Organic Tricolor Spaghetti for any situation that calls for spaghetti: it'll turn heads when 
topped with tomato sauce and meatballs, bedazzle when bedecked with a fiery fra diavolo sauce, and captivate 
when covered with Cacio E Pepe Sauce [sku 70650]. Since it offers such a spectacle, however, we particularly 
like it for applications where it will get a chance to truly shine, like a refreshing cold pasta dish, or tossed with 
a sauce packed with visually complementary veggies, like zucchini, squash, and sundried tomatoes.

"055307","Turkey Stock","While taking stock of our shelf-stable broths, we realized we've got a pretty decent selection, including: Beef 
Broth [sku 92961]; Organic Vegetable Broth [sku 21509], also in a Low Sodium version [sku 98551]; and Chicken 
Broth in Free Range [sku 21447], Organic [sku 30416], and Organic Low Sodium [sku 87063] versions. 

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, it didn't take us long to conclude we're missing one very important 
flavor: Turkey! We couldn't let another holiday season pass us by without adding turkey to the mix. But, why 
""stock"" and not ""broth""? Traditionally, broth is made from meat juices and is less intense in flavor, having been 
cooked for a shorter period of time. Stock, on the other hand, is made when meat bones are slow-cooked in 
water, yielding a richer, more complex meat flavor. Stock is especially good for main meal dishes, gravies, and 
soup bases. This is true of Trader Joe's Turkey Stock. 

Our Stock is lightly seasoned, and slow-simmered with mirepoix (a mix of onions, carrots, and celery) for 
added taste-complexity, making it a wonderful, flavorful base for soups and sauces. Use it to baste your holiday 
bird, keeping it moist as it roasts for hours. When your bird is cooked, use our Turkey Stock to deglaze the little 
browned bits of meat that remain on your roasting pan-the beginnings of a knock-out gravy for your guests!

This is a seasonal product, available only for the holidays, so stock your pantry shelves while you can with 
Trader Joe's Turkey Stock. It shouldn't be too hard to do, since each 32 ounce, shelf stable carton is $2.29.

Gravy is one of those tastes. So is stuffing. To create Trader Joe's Everything but the Leftovers, we've distilled 
the essence of a stellar stuffing and a great gravy down to a shake-able-and vegan-Seasoning Blend so you 
can add these holiday flavors to anything! 

We selected savory herbs and spices including dehydrated onion, sea salt, black pepper, turmeric powder, 
dried celery seed, ground sage, rosemary powder, dried thyme, and dried parsley. If there are any ""secret"" 
ingredients, you might say it's the combination of two different yeasts (baker's and torula), which add umami 
essence, and bump up the ""savory"" even that much more!

Shake this kosher Seasoning on eggs, roasted vegetables, sandwiches, popcorn¿ even meat! Come to think of 
it, if your actual Thanksgiving gravy ends up not tasting gravy-ish, or your stuffing is not stuffing-ish enough, 
you can culinary course correct with just a few shakes!

"068324","Ajika Georgian Seasoning Blend","To call ajika a staple of Georgian-Abkhazian cuisine is a severe understatement: in the western regions of the 
Republic of Georgia, it's practically ubiquitous. There, it's traditionally prepared in paste form, from freshly 
ground chili peppers, garlic, various savory spices, and walnuts, and is served on everything from beef to 
bread, chicken to fish, or even just liberally spread on cheese. Our buyers had a chance to try this spectacularly 
savory seasoning in its dried spice form at an open air market in Georgia, and knew at once that it deserved a 
spot on our shelves in the form of Trader Joe's Ajika Georgian Seasoning Blend.

Every dash of Ajika awakens the flavors of whatever dish its added to with a pleasant hit of heat, a savory touch 
of garlic, and an alluring mix of aromatic seasonings like coriander, fenugreek, and marigold petals. Just like 
in Georgia, we recommend putting it on pretty much anything: grilled meats, roasted potatoes, soups, eggs, 
anything that can do with a bit more savory essence and spice will be made even more delicious with Trader 
Joe's Ajika Seasoning Blend. We're selling 2.1-ounce jars, every day - you can find them with our other spices

"047908","Italian Capellini","In English, capellini translates to ""little hairs,"" and if you've ever cooked up Capellini pasta, you know its name 
is quite fitting. Once boiled, it looks like a fine, cascading blonde mane! The only pasta that even comes close 
to its super-fine texture is capelli d'angelo, or angel hair pasta, which measures just a fraction of a millimeter 
less in diameter.
 
Trader Joe's Italian Capellini is produced outside of Naples, in a region of Italy well known for pasta 
proliferation. It's crafted for us by a family-owned company that's been making pasta for more than 100 years. 
First, they mill durum wheat into golden semolina flour, add the purest water from the Madonie wildlife 
reserve, and begin the mixing. Then, once it reaches the right consistency, the dough is pushed through the 
proper pasta die, and the completed Capellini is left to dry. Our supplier's attention to craft and commitment 
to technology results in consistent, quality Capellini every time.

Perhaps best of all, this classic pasta comes with a classic price. We're selling each one-pound package for just 
99¢.* Find it in our grocery section with our other authentic Italian pasta varieties.

"047909","Italian Linguine","Kitchen staples of the Italian persuasion always tend to have a naming convention that lets the consumer know 
a little bit about the food on their plate. Capellini literally meaning ""little hairs"" illustrates their size, penne is 
shaped like old-fashioned pen stylus tips, fettuccine means ""little ribbons"" while looking just like them. The 
list goes on. Linguine is a fun one, meaning ""little tongues"" in Italian, alluding to their slightly curved shape 
width-wise. With Trader Joe's Italian Linguine, we look to bring our shoppers a no frills version of the classic 
""little tongue"" Italian pasta.

And no frills, indeed! Our Italian Linguine is made with one simple ingredient: durum wheat semolina. We 
don't believe that a simple macaroni product that's been produced for centuries should require a laundry list of 
added ingredients to achieve tasty results. And let's get one thing clear: Trader Joe's Italian Linguine is a tasty 
product. It can be served with just a little olive oil, but becomes especially tasty when traditionally plated with 
a simple pesto to coat each elliptical noodle as you spin a bit onto your fork. Other common taste-elavating 
options include using tomato-based sauces or a light sauce with a seafood addition - think salmon, cod, or 
shrimp. In as little as 7 to 8 minutes of passively boiling pasta, you can have yourself a plate of Italian Linguine 
noodles, toothsomely al dente, of course, and you'll be sending your tastebuds on a flavorful flight 6,000 miles 
across the Atlantic to our favorite boot shaped nation!

They craft exquisitely smooth Spaghetti using only two main ingredients, as dictated by tradition: semolina and 
water. This is pasta that pairs well with almost any sauce, but these days, we're particularly fond of smothering it

"009292","Italian Farfalle","Croatia gets credit for inventing the bow tie way back in the 17th century.  While not wanting to take anything 
away from Croatian culture, we think it's important to recognize that Farfalle, the pasta shape that looks like a 
bow tie, was invented in Northern Italy about a hundred years before anyone thought to tie a scarf into a bow 
around his neck.  Sure, Farfalle translates to ""butterflies,"" and they do in fact look like little butterflies as well, 
but when was the last time you heard anyone refer to them as ""butterfly pasta""?  

Trader Joe's Farfalle is made for us by one of the most renowned pasta makers in Italy, using a specific variety 
of wheat that's grown only in Southern Italy.  In fact, in accordance with Italian tradition, there are only two 
ingredients in the pasta - durum semolina flour and water.  The texture of Farfalle makes it a winner in both 
hot and cold preparations.  Serve it hot with our Arrabiata Sauce [sku 99155], or cold, in a pasta salad, with 
fresh, seasonal veggies, and your favorite dressing.  Each one-pound bag is a mere 99¢, every day, a terrific 
value for imported Italian pasta.  You'll find it in our grocery aisle.

Penne Rigate","Penne (pronounced PEH-neh for the uninitiated) is one of the most famous Italian pasta shapes that's beloved 
the whole world over. It means ""pen"" in Italian which is a completely pragmatic naming convention after one 
look at the tubular pasta. This tube-shape with angled ends is inspired by the quill of an old school ink pen. 
Abiding by tradition, Trader Joe's Italian Penne Rigate maintains this shape and is certainly a pasta that's 
worth writing home about - in pen, that is.

Each al dente forkful of our imported Italian Penne Rigate appears as simply just thick, tubular pasta with 
ridges. But its actually an ingenious design ideal for retaining sauces on all that surface area - inside and out! 
Because of all that surface area, our Italian Penne Rigate goes magnificently with chunky meat sauces, thick 
vegetable-based sauces, and rich cream-based sauces. Additionally, Penne often finds its way into many baked 
pasta and casserole dishes as the thick lil' noodles make a wonderful foundation to load with meats, veggies, 
sauce, and heaps of cheeses, of course! Proudly made with only 100% durum wheat semolina, our Italian 
Penne Rigate can be ready to plate in as little as ten minutes in a boiling water bath!

For our latest non-traditional noodle, we've taken a break from the legumes and alternate grains and gone for 
something we think is truly unique: Trader Joe's Hearts of Palm Pasta! Tender, mild-tasting, hearts of palm 
come from the center of palm trees. Our Ecuadorian supplier takes special care to use only palms that have 
been cultivated specifically for heart harvesting. With their sustainable process, the palms are not cut down, 
which avoids endangering the trees. 

Harvested Hearts are cut into thin, white strands, using a special process. Nothing is added to this mild-
flavored Pasta, which means it's ideal for heating and tossing with a variety of different sauces. Go Italian with 
some marinara or take things in an Asian direction by making Palm Hearts Pad Thai. Trader Joe's Hearts of 
Palm Pasta even works well in your chicken noodle soup!

"066886","Kale & Cauliflower Chili","For some chili fans, the prospect of a flavorful and hearty chili minus the meat seems near impossible. 
Fortunately, Trader Joe's Kale & Cauliflower Chili proves the impossible is possible!

The key to this vegan Chili's success is in its recipe. The base of diced tomatoes and tomato purée is well-
seasoned with onion, garlic purée, and a host of warm spices, including paprika, cumin, cinnamon, black 
pepper, and cayenne. Jalapeño purée and hatch chile powder lend a fair amount of spicy heat. And because 
this chili is in a large jar (versus a small can or Tetra carton), we are able to include plenty of hearty vegetables, 
including shredded kale, riced cauliflower, and lots of white navy beans.

Heat up the jar contents in a microwave-safe container or in a saucepan on the stovetop, and serve it steaming 
in a bowl, with Trader Joe's French Baguette [sku 92501] for dipping. Or scoop it up with Organic Stone Ground 
Blue Corn Tortilla Chips [sku 53149]. If you're keeping it vegan, try dicing some slices of Cheddar Style Cashew

dish, it's a cultural force of its own. It's served as the inspiration for countless recipes across the African diaspora, 
including jambalaya and gumbo. It's even sparked a friendly (if not, at times, heated) rivalry between a handful 
of nations regarding who makes the best version. If you've ever had the chance to try it, you know exactly why 
it's remained such a vital part of African cuisine for over 700 years. And if you haven't had a chance yet, may

"069753","Chili Sesame Oil","To call chili oil a simple condiment would be a disservice to its transformative power: chili oil doesn't just 
complement foods, it gives flavors a whole new dimension via its combination of steady spice and savory 
nuttiness. And yet, simplicity is one of its greatest strengths - if you check the ingredient list on Trader Joe's 
Chili Sesame Oil, for instance, you'll see only sesame oil and dried red chilies. How can something so simple 
provide such stunning complexity? It's best not to question it. Better instead to simply enjoy it on anything that 
could use a bit of savory spice, like pizzas, burgers, potstickers. spring rolls, and more.

Made especially for us by a supplier in Thailand, Trader Joe's Chili Sesame Oil lends foods a flavor boost that 
takes place in two phases: first, there's the baseline of toasty, earthy sesame oil, which gives the brighter flavors 
of whatever you're adding it to something to bounce off of. Critically, it also coats the tongue, which lets the 
heat of the red chilies take hold and begin to spread. The more you eat, the more intense the heat becomes, 
waking up the other flavors present and turning an everyday eating experience into something thrilling. Sounds 
exciting, no? That's simply the power of Chili Sesame Oil.

"069517","Kalamata Olives with Jalapeños & Peri Peri Peppers","On their own, Kalamatas are elegant and fruity, with a dense, almost meaty texture - a near-perfect inclusion 
for mezze boards and tapas plates. But even near-perfection can do with the occasional twist, as is skillfully 
demonstrated by Trader Joe's Kalamata Olives with Jalapeños and Peri Peri Peppers. This jar of whole, 
unpitted Kalamatas and sliced jalapeños & Peri Peris builds upon its star olives' savory sophistication with a 
devilish dose of peppery heat to brilliant effect, whether you enjoy them as a side, as an ingredient in part of a 
larger recipe, or simply as a snack, straight from the jar.

As they marinate together in the brine, these Kalamatas don't just take on some of the spice from their pepper 
partners, but some of their subtler flavors, too: there's the fresh, vegetal notes of the jalapeño, and the brighter, 
tarter notes of the Peri Peri, each accentuating and enhancing the deeper Kalamata profile. We find that this 
fiery balancing act tastes especially great when the olives are warmed up slightly before serving, and pairs 
particularly well with a plate of warm cheese, too: think our Greek Feta in Brine [sku 86232] or a freshly-grilled

depth that none of us were expecting, and that left every last one of us wanting more. 

We're bringing Pumpkin Bisque into our stores for a limited time, during Pumpkin Season. When it's gone, 
there definitely won't be any more until next year, so if soup is your thing, and Pumpkin is your season, you

"063216","Autumnal Harvest Soup","We're simply in awe over autumn. We love the brisker temperatures, the earlier sunsets, and the oh-so-satis-
fying crunch of a dry autumn leaf underfoot, to be sure. But we love most of all that autumn is the definitive 
beginning of soup season, when steamy, full-flavored chowders, bisques, and broths reign supreme, and bowl-
fuls of soup warm hearts and stomachs everywhere. That's why we created Trader Joe's Autumnal Harvest 
Soup, an eminently edible tribute to the flavors and feelings of fall. 

Inside each seasonally decorative mason jar of Autumnal Harvest Soup, you'll find a medley of some of 
our favorite chunky harvest produce (including smooth butternut squash, semi-sweet pumpkin, and slow-
simmered California tomatoes), seasoned with earthy autumn herbs like rosemary and sage, and finished 
with rich heavy cream. All that's required on your part is to open the jar, empty its contents into a saucepan, 
and stir over medium heat for six to eight minutes (or, alternatively, microwave on high in a microwave-safe 
container for three to four minutes). Your reward is a kitchen filled with the warm aromas of autumn cook-
ing, and soon enough, a bowl of pure fall joy.

Trader Joe's Autumnal Harvest Soup is a sweet, savory, consummate comfort food, created to keep you 
warm and cozy all autumn long. And at $3.99 for a 25 ounce jar, it's a comfort to your wallet, too. But be sure 
to stock up while you can: once autumn's gone, so too will this limited-availability soup leave our shelves.

"055267","Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Baking Mix","All pumpkin, all the time. That's our motto around here-at least during pumpkin season. We already have a 
conventional Pumpkin Bread Mix [sku 52484], but we're so goo-goo for pumpkin (and we're also on a bit of a 
gluten free kick), we couldn't help but add this version for our gluten sensitive friends.

Trader Joe's Gluten Free Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Baking Mix is easy to make (add egg, oil & water, mix, and 
bake), and even easier to eat. When we tasted it, what impressed us most about this Mix was that if we hadn't 
known it was gluten free, we wouldn't have known it was gluten free. Our supplier is expert at mixing gluten free 
flours (like sorghum, millet, and brown rice) in just the right proportions, which is why this Mix bakes into light 
and airy breads and muffins that taste like you made them from scratch. 

You can add nuts for a little crunch, or chocolate chips for a bit more sweetness. The box includes instructions 
for a single loaf or a dozen muffins-either way, if you're a pumpkin bread enthusiast who's trending gluten free, 
this is a must buy for Pumpkin Season 2015.

We're selling each 17.5-ounce box of Gluten free Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Baking Mix for $3.99, while sup-
plies last. You'll find it with our baking mixes.

"052484","Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Mix","At Trader Joe's, there are products we bring in at certain times of the year that we don't have the rest 
of the year. One of the favorites for fall is Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bread and Muffin Mix, a simple, 
straightforward baking mix that delivers excellent results with very little effort. It's become such a favorite, 
in fact, that we know people who buy cases of it when it arrives each fall, hoping to make it last until the 
following autumn, when it makes its annual return.

Each box, combined with eggs, oil and water, makes a loaf of moist and fluffy, lightly spiced pumpkin bread 
or a dozen standard-sized muffins. One of our favorite things about homemade pumpkin bread is the way 
the subtle flavor of the pumpkin is perfectly complemented by the zesty additions of spices like cinnamon 
and nutmeg. Our mix has all these things, and we've done all the mixing and measuring for you. If you 
find yourself feeling adventurous, add chopped nuts, dried fruit, or shredded carrots or zucchini for an extra 
splash of color and texture. Kids - and kids at heart - we know really love it mixed with chocolate chips. 
Kids are smart.

Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bread and Muffin Mix contains no artificial colors or flavors and no preservatives,

the most interesting meal of the day, too. That's why we love Trader Joe's Maple Pecan Clusters Cereal, a 
captivatingly crunchty collection of chopped pecans, corn flakes, multigrain flakes, and maple-tinged clusters 
of crispy rolled oats. Every bite boats a wide variety of crunchy textures and toasty flavors, plus a lively note of 
maple syrup, turning any rote, mundane breakfast into something a little more special.

Enjoy Trader Joe's Maple Pecan Clusters in the classic way, poured into a bowl with milk or non-dairy 
alternative (try a flavored non-dairy beverage like Vanilla Coconut Milk Beverage [sku 96069] for even more 
variety). Enjoy it mixed with your other favorite nuts or dried fruit for a quick, ad hoc trail mix. Sprinkle it over 
your favorite yogurt for an effortless parfait. No matter how you have them, Trader Joe's Maple Pecan Clusters

the everythings in existence. You'll quickly conclude that only one everything is sufficient-or even possible.

Now, when it comes to spice blends, we also believe that just one Everything is sufficient, and that's our 
Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend. 

This is the only Everything Seasoning you'll ever need for decorating and yummifying the tops of bagels-but 
that's not everything. This simple (yet exemplary) blend of sesame seeds (white and black), poppy seeds, dried 
garlic & onion, and sea salt flakes is all you need for bringing that crunchy, roasted, savory flavor to grilled 
chicken, buttered popcorn, baked potatoes, creamy dips, pizza dough, salad dressings, pasta, mac & cheese, or 
panko-breaded anything.

At Trader Joe's, there's only one Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend, and you'll find it on our 
shelves next to everything else in our spice collection. Each 2.3 ounce glass shaker is available for less than two 
dollars more than nothing. (That's $1.99.)

support for at-home tacos as our original Stone Ground Yellow Taco Shells [sku 69808], but do so while sporting 
an alluring, azure hue. If you're feeling up for tacos, we humbly suggest that you try feeling blue, too!

Each box contains 12 ready-to-eat and ready-to-fill-to-your-heart's-content Taco Shells made from naturally 
blue stone ground corn. Best served slightly warm (i.e., heated in an oven at 350°F for three to five minutes),

"050262","Organic Black Beans","Talk about a value! A 15.5 ounce can of great tasting, high protein, high fiber, fat free, completely vegetarian, 
Trader Joe's Organic Black Beans costs only 99¢! That's a deal and a half, for less than a buck and a half. What's 
that? You're not yet an aficionado of this legendary legume? We'll guess, then, that you're at least a bit of a curiosity-
seeker, right? And at 99¢ a can, our Organic Black Beans are custom-made for the frugal-but-curious.

Scientifically known as Phaselous vulgari, black beans are quite popular in the cuisines of Latin and South 
America, as well as those of the American Southwest. Trader Joe's Organic Black Beans are low in sodium and 
a good source of fiber. They're tender and almost meaty in texture - this may very well be why they're a perennial 
favorite protein source for vegetarians. Or, it may be because they are so satisfying, whether enjoyed on their 
own or used in recipes. Or, it may have something to do with the fact that, at just under a buck a can, they're so 
wonderfully affordable. Serve them with rice, wrap them up in tortillas, or really go for the protein gold and serve 
them alongside a piece of grilled fish or lean pork chop. You'll find them in our grocery aisle.

"096797","Cocoa Almond Spread","¿  

Introducing, Trader Joe's Cocoa Almond Spread.
We decided to take a fresh look at (and taste of) the world of chocolate-nut butter blends. 
Nutella (which is hazelnuts and chocolate) is now a top-selling spread worldwide. 
However, we sold Nutella, and we sold an even better-tasting private-label version of 
Nutella and, frankly, they taste just so-so and sold just so-slow. The main problem is 
hazelnuts. No offense to hazelnuts, but they taste too much like hazelnuts. So we went to 
work tasting peanut butters with chocolate, chocolate with Cashew butter, with 
Almonds¿and that's the winner! The best tasting blends of all were almond butter with 
chocolate. So we tried creamy and crunchy, with different chocolates, sweetness and 
blends from around the county and from around the world. 
After all that spreading and eating, we can safely say, Trader Joe's Cocoa Almond 
Spread, which is a creamy smooth blend made with California almonds and Belgian 
Cocoa is the best-tasting nut-butter & chocolate spread you'll ever taste! It will make 
your toast, pancakes and apple slices a real treat. Trader Joe's Cocoa Almond Spread
is just $3.99 for a 13 ounce jar of joy!

"070304","Cassava Cauliflower Blend Baking Mix","Thinking about pancakes or waffles? Maybe a batch of cupcakes or muffins? We suggest Trader Joe's Cassava 
Cauliflower Blend Baking Mix. This mix is a carefully calibrated blend of three gluten free flours - cassava, 
cauliflower, and fonio - combined with baking powder & salt, making it ready to use for so many cooking and 
baking endeavors.

Our supplier, originally from Nigeria, is passionate about bringing the foods she grew up with in West Africa 
to the American palate. Here, she's combined Cassava - also known as yuca - a starchy, root vegetable that 
behaves much like wheat flour in baking, with Fonio, a nutrient-dense grain related to millet, and native to 
West Africa. When milled into flour, it delivers a mild, subtly nutty flavor. Including cauliflower powder (flour) 
in the blend means lower overall carbs than comparable gluten free baking mixes. This multi-purpose baking 
mix is mild-tasting, and produces baked goods that are dense and delicious - not grainy or gritty like some 
other gluten free mixes. We're selling it in a 16 ounce, resealable bag, every day.

"070379","Organic Canola Oil Spray","If you spend any amount of time in the kitchen, chances are you're spending some of that time applying oil to 
a cooking surface, be it a baking dish, cookie sheet, or skillet. That's where tools like our Organic Canola Oil 
Spray come in handy: they're an easy way to apply a quick, even layer of oil without having to do much fussing 
or finagling with measuring spoons, spatulas, or paper towels. Add to that the fact that it uses an air pressure-
based, non-aeorosol Bag-On-Valve spraying system rather than propellents, and you've got a seriously can-do 
can of Organic Canola Oil Spray on your hands.

To use, simply hold the can about 6-12 inches away from the unheated cooking surface you'd like to be oiled, 
then depress the top button to spray, moving as needed to apply a nice, even coat. This Organic Canola has 
a smoke point of 375°F-400°F, making it ideal for using in sautés and stir fries, or baking in the oven at lower 
temperatures. It'll save you time, save you the hassle of extra dishes, and, of course, since this is Trader Joe's, 
each 4.73-oz. can will save you money, too.

turning delicious meals into transcendent ones. 

From something as simple as a baked sweet potato to something as rich as a slice of New York Cheesecake

of complexity. Try it on sandwiches, pizza, or shrimp tacos for an elevated everyday eating experience. Give 
it a go over pan-fried Gnocchi [sku 52319], roasted carrots, or barbecued meat skewers for a bit of gourmet 
experimentation. And if you're really adventurous, you can even try it with pancakes, parfaits, or mixed into

"061753","Quinoa Stuffed Dolmas","A favored foodstuff across a broad spectrum of cultures throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkans, 
the term ""Dolmas"" actually applies to a pretty wide variety of dishes. Everything from stuffed peppers to 
stuffed eggplant or cabbage rolls are included, though we here in the States traditionally think of Dolmas 
as grape leaves stuffed with soft, seasoned rice - the kind you'd find in our ever-popular Trader Joe's Dolmas 
[sku 50752]. We love a good twist on a traditional favorite, and that's just what we've created with our brand 
new Trader Joe's Quinoa Stuffed Dolmas, a delicious Dolma remix from the same celebrated supplier of our 
original version.

Each Quinoa Stuffed Dolma is made by taking naturally zesty grape leaves that have been brined and 
marinated until they're soft and pliable, and carefully wrapping them around bundles of earthy quinoa that 
have been seasoned with lemon juice, herbs, garlic, and onion. They're then packed in a convenient, easy-open, 
shelf-stable tin, so they're ready to eat whenever you're in need of a good snack, starter, or main course - we 
particularly like them slightly warmed and served with a cool, creamy sauce, like our Everything But the Bagel

"056278","Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce","Residents of the Mediterranean basin-especially countries like Italy and Greece-love their beans. Beans are 
an integral part of the Mediterranean diet, not only for practical purposes (when religious fasts require non-
animal proteins), but also for palatable purposes, since beans can be prepared in so many delicious ways. If you 
haven't yet been sold on the pleasures of beans, Trader Joe's Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce makes a 
mouthwatering case.

Our Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce is modeled after the traditional Greek dish called gigandes plaki; although, 
we've adjusted the recipe a bit, as we do. Our supplier (in Greece!) takes cannellini beans (in place of traditional, 
smaller runner beans), and soaks and boils them until they are plump and soft, not to mention Giant (relatively 
speaking, of course). These big Beans are combined with a Tomato Sauce that includes strips of onion, and 
finely chopped parsley and dill. It's seasoned with salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper. This simple, yet 
delectable, mixture is baked to a rich consistency and finally, canned for you. 

Canned? you say. Don't let the can fool you. This ready-to-eat dish with its smooth, aromatic sauce; cubes 
of peeled tomatoes; and tender, melt-in-your-mouth beans does not disappoint-even enjoyed at room 
temperature, straight out of the can. Serve these Giant Beans in a little white bowl as part of a meze spread. Or, 
warm it up and combine with some wilted spinach and top with Crumbled Feta [sku 25966]. It even makes a 
quick, compact vegetarian lunch-no refrigeration required!

We're selling each 9.6 ounce can of Trader Joe's Giant Baked Beans in Tomato Sauce for $1.99. Find it on our

"060942","Organic Italian Artisan Gigli Pasta","Bari is the capital of southern Italy's Puglia region - geographically, the top of the heel of the boot - and also 
the birthplace of our new lineup of Organic Italian Artisan Pastas. Does one need to travel to the eastern 
reaches of the Italian peninsula to find pasta? Of course not. But our product development team is not in the 
business of need; no, they're in the business of must have. And really, after a single bite of this extraordinary 
pasta, we realized this (and its partners) was a Trader Joe's must have.

Traditional Italian pasta is made with only two ingredients, durum wheat semolina flour and water - a small 
amount of softer wheat flour is allowed by law, but Trader Joe's Organic Italian Artisan Gigli Pasta is crafted 
with 100% organic durum wheat semolina sourced from farms in Puglia. Our supplier has been producing 
artisan-made pasta for more than 35 years. Most dried pasta (including our 99¢ Italian offerings) are made 
in huge batches and dried quickly, from three to 12 hours. This Artisan Pasta is made in small batches, and 
dried at much lower temperatures for up to 24 hours, resulting in a more rustic texture that cooks to a de-
lightfully al dente texture. Gigli, also known as Campanelle (translates to ""bellflowers"" or ""little bells""), has a

oil and shaved Parmesan? Any of these will do, deliciously.

We're selling each 17.6 ounce bag of Organic Italian Artisan Gigli Pasta for $2.69, a delicious value you'll 
find only at Trader Joe's. You'll find it in our grocery section, alongside our other pastas.

"061403","Tikka Vegetables","There's something transcendent about Indian cuisine. Vegetarian Indian cuisine, in particular, has a remarkable 
ability to bring even the simplest of veggies to new heights of flavor and aromatic expression with a generous 
application of spice. Of course, actually doing the work of making veggies transcendently delicious takes con-
siderable time and effort, and ordering from a restaurant begins to add up, quickly. That's why we're introducing 
Trader Joe's Indian Fare Tikka Vegetables: superbly spiced vegetables in a creamy Tikka Masala sauce that's 
easy to prepare, and beyond easy to enjoy.

Packed inside a convenient, shelf-stable pouch, our Tikka Vegetables combine the splendidly savory elements 
of Tikka Masala and vegetables with the ease of grabbing a spice from your cupboard. To enjoy each pouch's 
delicious mix of carrots, potatoes, onions, and green peas in a flavorful tomato and cream sauce, all you need 
to do is either (carefully) drop the entire package into a pot of boiling water for five minutes, or cut a two-inch 
slit into one corner of the package and microwave it for one minute. That's right, all that's separating you from a 
tempting, traditionally-spiced Tikka dish is five minutes of cooking - or less!

When vegetarian Indian cuisine is this accessible, the possibilities only grow. Keep a few pouches in your pantry 
on hand for whenever you need a last-minute side for a meal of grilled Shawarma Chicken Thighs [sku 60667], 
or serve atop a bowl of heated Frozen Brown Rice [sku 93756] for a lunch that takes only minutes to make. We're 
selling each 10 oz. pouch of Trader Joe's Indian Fare Tikka Vegetables for $1.99. If you ask us, that's a tran-
scendently good value. You'll find them on the shelf of our grocery aisle.

"057608","Giant Chalkidiki Olives","Big. Huge. Gargantuan. Enormous. These olives are truly giant. They are the Incredible Hulk of the olive world. 
Unlike the Hulk, they evoke no anger or discord. Actually, you'll feel quite the opposite when faced with Trader 
Joe's Chalkidiki Olives; you'll find yourself feeling joyful, hopeful, excited for the possibilities that lie ahead. And 
you can be assured that you will not be disappointed. You will approach these Giant Chalkidiki Olives with excite-
ment, and you will walk away from every encounter with that excitement still intact.

Inside each jar of Trader Joe's Giant Chalkidiki Olives are Chalkidiki olives grown on the Chalkidiki peninsula (ad-
jacent to Mt. Athos) and the nearby seaside Kavala region. In addition to being home to some of the world's most 
gigantic olives, Chalkidiki (also known as Halkidiki) is widely known as the birthplace of Aristotle. Aristotle likely 
ate olives - especially if they tasted this good. And so, by enjoying these Giant Chalkidiki Olives, you are but one 
step removed from one of the great minds in the history of civilization. Pretty great.

Our Giant Chalkidiki Olives are among the largest olives we've seen, and unlike many other very large olives, they 
have a very high ratio of flesh to pit (more to enjoy!) They are brined in a simple mixture of water and sea salt (with 
citric acid to keep the acidity in check, and ascorbic acid [vitamin C] for freshness), so you get to enjoy each olive's 
fruity flavor. They're firm and meaty, truly some of our all-time favorites. These Olives come in a 17.6 ounce glass 
jar, and will be much admired in a gift basket for a food lover. Also admirable is our price of $2.29 for each 17.6 
ounce jar (9.88 ounces drained weight). You'll find them in our grocery aisle.

"068389","Ube Mochi Pancake & Waffle Mix","The sweet yammy flavor of Ube, combined with its signature purple hue, make it an irresistibly lively addition 
to jams, cakes, candies¿we even added an Ube Ice Cream [sku 61854] to our lineup last year! Its popularity, 
combined with an unforgettable breakfast our Buyer had in Hawaii last year, inspired the creation of our 
newest seasonal offering, Trader Joe's Ube Mochi Pancake & Waffle Mix.

The base of this gluten free Mix is made with sweet rice flour, which gives the resulting Pancakes or Waffles a 
chewy texture, and sweet, yammy, coconut flavor that comes from the Ube powder and natural flavor.  The soft 
purple hue is achieved by way of red cabbage and radish juices, which makes the Pancakes just as fun to look 
at as they are to eat (especially when drizzled with melted butter and syrup). Simply add water, eggs, and oil or 
butter, and you've got a beautiful batter that will help you break fast, brilliantly. 

We're offering brightly colored boxes of Trader Joe's Ube Mochi Pancake & Waffle Mix at a price that won't 
break the bank-$3.99* for 13.3 ounces. Find them on our grocery shelves, for a limited time.

products? Of course we do! Case-in-point: Trader Joe's Marshmallows. For some time now, we've listened to 
the cries of mallow-fiends, fluff enthusiasts, and campers everywhere. Give us marshmallows, or give us death! 
they cry. Okay, we're exaggerating-but extreme language aside, the sentiment is real: our customers want 
marshmallows.

The thing is, not just any marshmallow is worthy of the Trader Joe's name. So we took our time.  We searched 
high and low. And we believe we've found marshmallow mecca. Not only are Trader Joe's Marshmallows free 
from artificial flavors, added colors, and GMO ingredients (which cannot be said for most other brands), but 
they are also gluten free and... drumroll, please¿ gelatin free! If you follow a vegan or kosher diet, you know 
this is special-it's nearly impossible to find marshmallows made without gelatin, and if you do, they typically 
cost an arm and a marshmallow-man-sized leg.  

Roast our Marshmallows over the fire at your family cookout. Use them in your next batch of rice crispy 
treats made with TJ's Crisp Rice Cereal [sku 94665]. Melt them over a sweet potato bake or a bag of TJ's Sweet 
Potato Fries [sku 92157]-you know, like cheese fries... but¿ mallow fries. And if you happen to get caught 
in the wilderness without your gear, we dare say that a bag of our fluffy-yet-substantial Marshmallows would 
make a decent pillow. (Because you might forget your pillow, but nobody forgets the marshmallows¿)

We're selling each ten ounce bag of Trader Joe's Marshmallows for $2.99-but stock up while you can, 
because these pillow-y puffs are seasonal and will be gone by summer's end¿

case of Trader Joe's Spicy Kosher Dill Pickles, we've added heat, completing the triumvirate of savory-treat 
tastes!

These Spicy Kosher Dill Pickles come to us from Bulgaria, where our supplier works with local farmers to 
grow and hand-harvest these miniature cukes (technically, they're gherkins). Because cucumbers will continue 
to grow for as long as they're left on the vine, the timing of the harvest is especially important-if they're picked 
too soon, they won't be big enough, but if they're left too long, they won't fit in the jar.

Within 24 hours of picking, they get to pickling in a garlicky brine with spices that include mustard and 
coriander seeds, allspice, black pepper, and bay leaves. But the real kicker is the hot Pfefferoni Peppers included 
in the jar. These add just the right amount of pepper play to partner with the salty, tangy crunch and produce 
prodigiously piquant Kosher Dill Pickles!

versatile, and undoubtedly delicious. Mix it with egg, oil and water, and you're on your way to the tastiest batch 
of baked banana goodness (be it loaf, muffin or cake), bar none.

The secret to the sweet banana goodness in Trader Joe's Banana Bread Mix? No surprise-it's banana. Or to 
be more accurate, dehydrated banana flakes. The flake format makes mixing so much easier, and ensures rich, 
ripe banana flavor, without the risk of a bunch of bananas rotting on your kitchen counter. Natural vanilla flavor 
and salt further amplify the banana in this Mix, which is complemented by the additions of nutty wheat germ 
and bran. With a golden exterior and tender inner crumb, it truly is the best Banana Bread Mix you can get 
your hands on.

Watermelon. We love watermelon. And if summertime sales are any indication, you love it, too! What-a-
melon, indeed...
 
Fortunately for all of us, Trader Joe's Organic Watermelon Fruit Spread tastes just like the real, melon-y 
McCoy-which is exactly what it should taste like, given that organic watermelon purée accounts for 60% of its 
recipe! We add organic cane sugar to sweeten the deal, fruit pectin for consistency, and a bit of organic cherry 
juice concentrate for tad of tartness, and the resulting Spread is as sweet, summery & refreshing as the melon 
itself. Plus, it's pretty-in-pink, so it looks lovely spread upon a toasted Brioche Bun [61752], or spooned atop a 
scoop of vanilla ice cream/slice of cheesecake.

blend that echoes that seedy seasoning our Customers have come to love. 

Black and white sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and sea salt combine with the natural flavors of garlic and onion to 
complement these nuts. It's a crunchy, nutty sensation with lots of savory flavor and 6g of protein per quarter-

"067207","Mediterranean Dorade","Known as Orata in Italy, Dorada in Spain, and Gilthead Sea Bream in English-speaking countries, Trader Joe's 
Mediterranean Dorade (the French name) is farmed off the shores of North Africa. Dorade's mild-flavored, 
white meat is tender and tasty, which is why you'll find it on menus at fine restaurants around the world. It's 
regularly cooked in classics such as French Bouillabaisse (indeed, it also holds up well when simmered over a 
period of time). However, we've chosen to feature it in another classic form: the convenient and always at-hand 
fish tin!

Our supplier hand-packs these full, skin-on fillets of Dorade very simply, with just olive oil and a touch of 
salt. This preparation and the fish's tasty flavor make it a great snack on lightly buttered crackers or pieces 
of baguette. Tuna fans who are looking for a change-up, might try making a tuna-style salad with it. 

This tin fish also makes a great green-salad topper, especially when you're looking for protein alternatives. Each 
one-tin serving (4.4 oz. drained weight) delivers 29g of protein, with just 190 calories. If you're not yet a fan of 
fish-in-a-tin, Trader Joe's Mediterranean Dorade just might make you one!

Trader Joe's Organic Unbleached All-Purpose Flour is exactly that, nothing more. And while simple, as

That wheat is milled to a fine consistency that's great for all your culinary needs (thus, All -Purpose). Unlike 
much mass-market flour, though, this one isn't bleached and highly processed - ever notice ""enriched' on the 
packaging for flour? It's only ""enriched"" with vitamins and minerals because heavily processing and bleaching 
the flour to make it oh-so-white strips all the naturally occurring vitamins and minerals out. Ours is just

"070154","Creamed Multi-Floral New Zealand Honey","With the popularity of sugar alternatives on the rise, honey-already a classic pantry staple-is having an 
extra-sweet moment in the spotlight. We currently offer some fantastic honeys in our grocery aisle, but we 
haven't offered a creamed honey on our shelves in quite some time. So, when our Buyer stumbled upon an 
opportunity to do so, she pounced-or stung, as it were...

Trader Joe's Creamed Multi-Floral New Zealand Honey comes from bees pollinating a variety of different 
flowering trees, shrubs, plants, and other nectar sources. As a result, its flavor profile is a little bit floral, a 
little bit herbal, and a little bit earthy-kind of like Manuka honey, but less medicinal-tasting. About 80% of 
New Zealand's trees and plants are endemic to New Zealand, so when we say you won't find honey like this 
anywhere else, we mean it! The real buzz about this honey, though, is that it's ""Creamed."" Does this mean 
we're adding milk products to it? Absolutely not! It means we're adding microscopic ""seed crystals"" (finely 
crystallized honey) to the liquid honey, then stirring it for hours on end to get the perfect, spreadable, luxurious 
consistency and golden-light color. 

Here's some more luxurious consistency for you: we're offering Trader Joe's Creamed Multi-Floral New 
Zealand Honey at an incredible value-$3.99* per one-pound jar. Pretty sweet, right?

Umami is the word used to describe the fifth taste - in addition to sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Taken 
from Japanese, the word translates to ""pleasant savory taste,"" and really, it's just that. And it's really just 
something you're going to want to put on¿ everything. 

To create this Umami Seasoning Blend, we began with kosher salt, and used a flavor base of porcini 
and white button mushrooms - earthy mushroom flavor really is the cornerstone of umami, which is 
why we named it Mushroom & Company. The ingredient list also includes onion, mustard seed, red & 
black pepper, and thyme. If you follow an eating plan like Paleo or Whole 30, this type of seasoning is 
a staple. If you follow an eating plan like we do, also known as Anything and Everything, Trader Joe's

greens: kale, Swiss chard, and spinach. The broth is made with a slow-simmered blend of tomatoes, carrots, 
celery, and onions, accented with herbs and spices, and finished with olive oil. This is the Vegetable Soup you'd 
make at home if you had time to make soup. Since we've done the work for you, scrumptuous soup is as easy as 
twist, pour, heat, and slurp. Delicious! You'll find it in a 25.75 ounce jar, on our grocery shelves.

"058861","Organic Fruit & Seed Granola","Yes, it's true. Granola usually contains oats. Our cereal aisle is loaded with oat-based granolas, and they're deli-
cious. But because we had those granolas covered, we thought it high time for a granola of another color-or, 
ingredient list-and Trader Joe's Organic Fruit & Seed Granola is just that granola.

Thanks to its ingredient list, this is a granola for everyone. The list of attributes for this Fruit & Seed Granola is 
extensive: it's grain free, gluten free, and vegan. No oats also means more room for other good stuff. Sunflower 
seeds, coconut, sesame seeds, dried cranberries, raisins, flax seeds, chia seeds, and hempseeds are all packed 
into the sweet, crunchy clusters you'll find inside the bag. The creation process is pretty simple: the ingredients 
are mixed together, baked in small batches, and crumbled into the perfect little clusters. 

Even though our Fruit & Seed Granola isn't like ordinary granola, it's still perfect for all your typical granola 
uses. You know the drill: serve with milk, Vanilla Almond Beverage [sku 94741], Honey Greek Yogurt [sku 
78613], or even French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576]. Of course, you're not limited to this. Add into muffins 
or breads. Toss on top of a salad or into a bowl of oatmeal. Make your own trail mix. No use is too ordinary or 
extraordinary for this Granola.

Each ten-ounce bag of Trader Joe's Organic Fruit & Seed Granola is $3.69, every day.

"062362","Wild Skipjack Tuna","There are several reasons Trader Joe's Wild Skipjack Tuna is an exciting addition to our grocery line up...

First, this Wild Skipjack is sustainably caught in Thailand, without the use of FADs (Fish Aggregating Devices). 
This approach aids in reducing by-catch. Second, as far as we can tell, this is the only Tuna on the market for 
which each fish is tested individually for mercury. Only those fish registering 0.15 parts per million of mercury 
or less are used. (Incidentally, this is approximately ten times stricter than the FDA mercury action limit.) 
Third, our Skipjack is hand-cut and hand-packed raw in the pouch, then slow-cooked (inside the pouch), 
sealing in nutrients and flavor. (Most canned tuna is cooked twice.)

As if you needed more reasons to enjoy this Wild Skipjack Tuna, we've also priced it as a real value: each three-
ounce pouch is $1.99*! Find it in our grocery aisle.

"059249","Onion Salt","Allium is the fancy (read: scientific) name for the onion and its many relatives, including garlic, scallions, leeks, 
and chives. There are alliums that you won't find in the kitchen-ones that add bright purple and pink flowers 
to spring gardens-but we tend to keep to culinary endeavors rather than horticultural ones. And with that in 
mind, we've created a new seasoning salt to celebrate these flavorful alliums: Trader Joe's Onion Salt.

It may be called Onion Salt, but it has a few other alliums that, in our opinion, make this seasoning truly spe-
cial. Granulated onion makes up the majority of this spice, but there's also granulated garlic, minced onion, 
kosher salt, green onion, and dried chives. Those last few ingredients give the spice its eye-catching green color 
and an extra kick of flavor. Most other onion salts on the market don't pack so many alliums in, making ours 
truly unique.

Now comes the tough part: choosing just how you want to use our Onion Salt. In addition to using it in place 
of regular salt when you're looking for a bit of extra onion-y flavor, try any one of the following: Shake on top 
of your morning eggs. Mix with sour cream or Greek Yogurt [sku 69707]for a tasty onion dip. Sprinkle on 
sweet potato fries, french fries, corn, or a baked potato. Season hamburgers, steaks, and seafood. Add to soups, 
sauces, marinades, or dressings¿ At $1.99, a 2.2 ounce jar of Trader Joe's Onion Salt might just change your 
life-or, at the very least, spice up your spice rack.

"057120","Crunchy Cinnamon Squares","""Don't be a square"" might be a common way to tell someone to be more adventurous or to get out of their com-
fort zone, but we're not sure why ""squares"" get such a bad rap. If we were the squares in Trader Joe's Crunchy 
Cinnamon Squares, we would be overjoyed to be squares-and tasty squares, at that.

You're probably wondering: how did we make squares so cool, scrumptious, and crispy? Well, small quadrilat-
erals made of whole wheat and rice flour are baked until insanely crunchy-this is how we put the ""crunch"" in 
Crunchy Cinnamon Squares. Of course, Crunchy Cinnamon Squares couldn't be called Crunchy Cinnamon 
Squares without cinnamon. You'll find the perfect amounts of cinnamon and sugar coating each crispy square. 
There's nothing square about this cereal-except the shape, of course.

The classic way to eat these Crunchy Cinnamon Squares would be to pour some in a bowl and douse with 
a generous splash of milk. If you're looking to eat outside the box, try sprinkling the sweet squares on top of 
French Vanilla Ice Cream [sku 78576]. You could even make a cinnamon-y version of your own rice crispy treat.

Call us squares, but true to the Trader Joe's way we've yet again got an outstanding value for you: each 12.2 ounce 
box of Trader Joe's Crunchy Cinnamon Squares is only $2.69. Sometimes, being a square isn't so bad. Eating 
them is pretty sweet, too.

"060290","Smoked Paprika","Seasoning is a powerful thing. It elevates everyday dishes with a hit of flavor or heat, that je ne sais quoi that 
impresses your guests, or simply satisfies your cravings. Maybe in your kitchen it's a dash of TJ's Coconut Aminos 
for umami¿ a pat of Cultured Butter for richness¿or a healthy shake of Everything But The Bagel Sesame 
Seasoning Blend for savory, seedy awesomeness. Soon to join the ranks of awe-inducing, seasoning superstars 
in kitchens everywhere is Trader Joe's Smoked Paprika. 

Our kosher certified Smoked Paprika is produced for us on the eastern coast of Spain, in warm Valencia, where 
our supplier has been working with paprika since 1945. Spanish-grown sweet red peppers are slowly roasted 
over hard wood planks to imbue this spice with its characteristic smokiness. The peppers are ground into a fine, 
super flavorful, brick red powder, and then packed into tins with a combination shaker/teaspoon lid, so you can 
use as much or as little as you like. 

When you're ready to unleash the power of Smoked Paprika, season liberally during cooking-add it to grilled 
shrimp, roasted chicken thighs, corn on the cob, French fries, paella¿ anywhere you want smoky, mildly sweet 
pepper flavor. (It's especially delicious with roasted Dutch Yellow Potatoes, Organic Sour Cream and chopped Parsley.)

Like our other superstar seasonings, Trader Joe's Smoked Paprika resides where price and quality (and flavor!) 
intersect-on our spice shelves. We're selling 2.6-ounce tins for the WOW value of $2.29, everyday.

heck, we've even got Grainless Granola [sku 56307]! And now? Now we present you with Trader Joe's Peanut 
Butter Protein Granola. Because granola is delicious, and getting an extra protein boost in that granola? Bonus!

Each bag of Granola is filled with chunky, crunchy, cane sugar-sweetened rolled oat clusters, bound together 
with rich peanut butter and peanuts. Peanut butter and peanuts both contain protein themselves, but we really 
put the ""protein"" in Peanut Butter Protein Granola by adding pea protein (yes, protein derived from peas) to 
these clusters. The result is a delicious bag of chunky, crunchy, peanut butter-y goodness that just happens to 
contain a whopping 11 grams of protein per serving. 

Trader Joe's Peanut Butter Protein Granola also just happens to come with a killer-value kinda price tag: we're

"069808","Organic Stone Ground Yellow Corn Taco Shells","We asked one of our snack suppliers to create organic taco shells for us, and they really came through. After all, 
this supplier is used to working with corn masa to make crispy chips, and the like. In this case, they channeled 
their masterful masa skills into making Trader Joe's Organic Stone Ground Yellow Corn Taco Shells.

These Shells are simple, made with 100% organic ingredients, including: organic stone-ground yellow corn, 
organic sunflower and/or organic safflower oil, and a trace of lime. Our supplier's handling of the corn flour, 
and their expert approach to cooking it in expeller-pressed oil, has culminated in a light, crisp, crunchy texture. 
The classic, hard-shell-taco shape is ideal for filling with ground beef, shredded cheese & lettuce, salsa, and 
guacamole to ensure a stellar-or might we say, ""shellar""-taco night!

We're selling 5.5-ounce boxes of twelve Organic Stone Ground Yellow Corn Taco Shells everyday at Trader 
Joe's.

"066804","Everything But The Elote Seasoning Blend","Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the 
cob known as Elote. While the fixins may vary some from vendor to vendor, elote typically comes slathered in 
mayo or crema, rolled in grated Parmesan or cotija cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime 
juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero or making elote at home can tell you, it's a 
highly crave-able combination of flavors that leaves a life-long impression.

Elotes are already pretty darn portable (they're usually served on sticks), but last year, we upped the ante on 
port-elote-ability with Trader Joe's Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers [sku 60564]. Suddenly, customers could 
enjoy all of that corny, creamy, spiced elote goodness¿ in a chip! The product's popularity was unprecedented. 
Which got us thinking¿ What other foods could use an elote infusion? Then, like an Everything Bagel in the 
mist, innovation revealed itself: let folks decide for themselves when & how to add the elote!

In the spirit of our Everything But the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend [sku 59137] that came before it, Trader Joe's 
Everything But the Elote Seasoning Blend is ""Everything"" you might find on elote-chile pepper, Parmesan 
cheese, chipotle powder, cumin, dried cilantro, sea salt, etc.-minus the corn itself. (We also add some corn 
flour & cane sugar, so there's really no mistaking what it's meant to mimic.)

You'll find new Trader Joe's Everything But the Elote Seasoning Blend sitting in our spice section, for $2.49*

"065967","Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend","Inspired by all the marvelous mojo-marinated meat we've enjoyed over the years, Trader Joe's Cuban Style 
Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is, as its name would suggest, traditionally tangy, good-n-garlicky, and 
downright delicious. We first saw these classic Cuban flavors in convenient seasoning form at a Miami mini-
market, and we knew we had to make one of our own.

Trader Joe's Cuban Style Citrusy Garlic Seasoning Blend is essentially a blend of garlic, lime oil, lime juice, 
onion powder, salt, and red pepper-plus bay leaves, coriander, cumin, cilantro, black pepper, oregano, cilantro, 
basil, lemon oil, marjoram, and parsley to round it out. It's all the essential flavors you'd find in common Cuban 
cuisine, packaged in one little 2.25-ounce jar, for one little, $1.99*-per-jar price! You'll find this new blend in

"061097","Falafel Mix","When we get excited about a particular product, it tends to command our waking moments-and sometimes 
our unconscious ones as well. Take our new Falafel Mix, for example. As we anxiously awaited its arrival on our 
shelves, we discussed the possibilities in the kitchen, and dreamed of the culinary creativity and experimentation 
that would occur, once we had the boxes in our hands¿But perhaps we should back up and explain why we're 
so ecstatic. 

The Mix itself is a traditional Mediterranean recipe of ground fava beans, chickpeas and spices that's chock full 
of flavor, and capable of creating the fried (or baked) Falafel of your dreams. Fragrant cumin and coriander and 
savory garlic and onion permeate the coarse dough, which bakes to an aromatically rich, golden brown. It takes 
some of the work out of making falafel at home, while yielding restaurant-quality results-and did we mention 
it's vegan, gluten free and kosher (pareve), too? 

For a dreamy meal, serve the finished fritters in a pita or atop a bed of crisp, chopped romaine, with fresh herbs 
and a generous drizzle of tahini. You could also create a mega mezze platter, surrounding your falafel with a 
moat of Tzatziki [sku 20405], Mediterranean Hummus [sku 90642], Cauliflower Tabbouleh [sku 58817], Dolmas 
[sku 50752] and warmed flatbread. Or break from tradition, and use this Mix as the base for savory scones or 
(the supremely fun to say) falafel waffles! 

We're offering 16-ounce boxes of Trader Joe's Falafel Mix for $2.99, everyday. You'll find them near our other 
baking mixes.

avocado's formidable forms, whether it's mashed up in a flavorful guacamole, sliced up to add crucial texture to a 
sandwich or salad, or pressed into a lush, velvety oil. We've carried regular Avocado Oil for a while, and now, in 
response to Customer requests, we now offer it in spray-able form!

Trader Joe's Avocado Spray Oil is made from top-tier, Mexican-grown avocados, picked at peak ripeness then 
expeller-pressed-sans heat & chemicals, of course. It's a relatively neutral oil with a mild scent, a gentle flavor 
and a notably high smoke point (around 500¿F), all of which make it a winning workhorse in the kitchen. Also, 
instead of arriving in an aerosol can, our Avocado Spray Oil benefits from bag-on- valve (BOV) technology, for 
a continuous spray minus the use of chemical propellants. Reach for it anytime you need cooking spray, whether 
you're greasing the grill for a BBQ, seasoning a skillet for a sauté, or even lubing-up a loaf pan before baking bread.

Psssst! Psssssssst! No, that's not just the sound of this Spray misting your main course-that's us telling you there's

no added MSG! Furikake imbues foods with a salty, satisfying, ocean-sesame crunch (not to be confused with 
open sesame crunch...), and it's good on far more than just fish. It's a great topper or mix-in for rice, eggs,

The 21st century has brought about a pasta renaissance, giving rise to seemingly countless iterations of these 
noble noodles. This revival has opened up our eyes and our taste buds to pasta's possibilities, including those 
delivered within each package of Trader Joe's Organic Yellow Lentil & Brown Rice Spaghetti. We took 
inspiration from our Red Lentil Sedanini pasta, a short cut that has proven quite popular in pasta circles. Here, 
we've developed a classic, long cut Spaghetti, and blended 90% organic yellow lentils with 10% organic brown 
rice (without the brown rice, the bean-based pasta doesn't hold its shape in this longer cut). With 14 grams of

chopped fresh tomatoes, asparagus, and grilled shrimp or chicken for a real treat!

Trader Joe's Gluten Freen Ginger Turmeric Granola begins with clusters of rolled oats, oat flakes, coconut 
flakes, and brown rice crisps to which is added candied ginger (and ginger powder) for a sweet & spicy ginger 
kick. Turmeric, along with cinnamon and nutmeg, bring additional warmth to the mix, with some sea salt and 
vanilla extract to round out the flavors.
