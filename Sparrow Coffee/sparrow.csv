With the first fermentation having fresh watermelon pieces in the tank along with the coffee, this experiment worked like a charm! From opening the bag you will smell the fresh watermelon and it will only get stronger as you brew. The initial flavor of the sip is sweet, almost candy like, moving quickly into juicy watermelon so fresh you can taste hints of the rind. With undertones of cashew and walnut this full bodied coffee is not to be missed.
